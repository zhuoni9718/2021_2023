Options: A) community kitchen, B) the post office, C) apartment, D) friend's house, E) tent,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that John bought a small butane stove that he can't use inside due to fumes. This suggests that he will need to use it in an outdoor setting. Options such as community kitchen, post office, and apartment do not have any clear connection to outdoor activities, leaving us with two options - friend's house or tent. Since John has bought a small butane stove, it is unlikely that he will need to cook for a large group and a tent may be a more logical option for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, or picnics.
Answer:
tent

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not involve a gathering of family members.
Answer:

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dental office handles patients who have experienced traumatic mouth injuries, which implies that these patients have been treated at a hospital before being referred to the dental office. The other options, such as town or office building, do not provide a clear reason for why patients would be experiencing traumatic mouth injuries. Schools may have sports injuries, but it is less likely that they would be referred to a dental office for treatment. Michigan is not relevant to the context of the sentence.

"Paste" is a commonly used shortcut on a computer, often used to copy and paste text or images. "Soft copy" refers to a digital copy of a document, but it does not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Unique" and "ocean" are not related to the topic of computer work or efficiency, and "creation" is too vague to clearly determine its connection to the sentence.

Question: What would I do if I was being attacked?
Options: A) stay alive, B) get rid of, C) attacked, D) defend yourself, E) fall down,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is being attacked, therefore they need to protect themselves from harm. "Defend yourself" is the only option that addresses this need. "Stay alive" is a general advice that may not be useful in the specific situation of being attacked. "Get rid of" and "fall down" are not applicable options in the context of an attack. "Attacked" is simply a repetition of the verb and does not offer any useful information or action.
Answer:
defend yourself

Subways and office buildings are also not appropriate options for spending the night.

While some birds may sing songs or sleep together as part of their mating behavior, these actions are not directly related to the process of reproduction. Spreading wings is also not related to reproduction, as all birds have the ability to do so for various reasons such as regulation of body temperature or for flight.
Answer:
lay eggs

The use of the term "settled" implies that an agreement was reached between the union and their employer, which likely satisfied their demands or addressed their complaints. As a result, the members would "go off strike" and "get back to work". The option "more money" may be a tempting choice, but it is not mentioned in the sentence and does not necessarily follow from the context.
Answer:
get back to work

Since sleighing rides are often seen as romantic activities, it is likely that the couple engages in an act of affection, such as kissing, at the end of their ride.

Question: What does breathing do for living things?
Options: A) asthma attacks, B) satisfies hunger, C) sustaining life, D) warm air, E) giving life,
Knowledge: Breathing is a vital process that allows living things to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide, which is necessary for the body's cells to carry out various functions. Without oxygen, the body's organs and tissues would not receive the necessary nutrients and energy to survive. Asthma attacks are a respiratory disorder that can impact breathing but do not describe the purpose of breathing itself. Satisfying hunger and warming air are not directly related to the respiratory system or the function of breathing. Giving life is a broad and vague concept that does not specifically relate to the function of breathing.

sustaining life

Options: A) discern, B) distinguish, C) metaphor, D) discriminate, E) contrast,

Contrast is the most logical opposite as it suggests a difference or dissimilarity. Discern and distinguish are also related to identifying differences, but don't necessarily imply a comparison.

Options: A) lose weight, B) loosing, C) loosing, D) loss, E) reduce,

The term "lose weight" specifically refers to reducing body weight, which can be accomplished through a variety of methods like changes in diet or exercise. The other options do not convey the idea of actively reducing the amount of body fat. "loosing" and "loosing" are incorrect spellings of "losing."

The verb "lower" is the most appropriate choice as it means to move something down or to a lower position. The other options, such as "fall" and "below" may also suggest downward movement, but they do not convey the deliberate and controlled lowering of an object. "Sun set" and "place" do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Answer:
lower

The option "victory" does not fit the context of the sentence, as it suggests a positive outcome, whereas the sentence clearly indicates a negative outcome. The option "casualties" refers to a group and not an individual and does not reflect the specific situation described in the sentence. The option "protect yourself" does not fit the sentence as it is not a possible outcome for someone with a grave injury. The option "death" is also a possible outcome, but it is not the one indicated in the sentence, as the person is still alive but in critical condition.
Answer:
dying

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher's pet enjoyed answering questions and was rewarded with something positive for each correct answer. The word "more" implies that the reward was increasing over time, which rules out the options of hate and confusion. Teaching and panic do not make sense in this context.

Knowledge: Sending mail is typically done at a post office or a postal service center. The term "over the counter" refers to the act of physically handing your mail to a clerk or representative at a service counter. Candy stores, butcher shops, and kitchens are not places where mail is commonly sent or received, and "animals" is not a relevant or appropriate answer.

post office
Question: James bought a new monitor and unpacked it.   He discarded the packaging materials and connected it.  What did he connect it to?
Options: A) internet cafe, B) display images, C) box, D) view bluescreen, E) desktop,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James connected the new monitor to something that would allow him to use it to display images, indicating that it was likely connected to a computer or other device with display capabilities. The options "internet cafe" and "view bluescreen" do not make sense in this context, and "box" is not a viable option for connecting a monitor. Therefore, "desktop" is the most logical answer.
Answer:
desktop
Question: People use a knife to clean their catch on what vessel?
Options: A) table, B) kitchen drawer, C) fishing boat, D) pocket, E) board,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the context is related to fishing, since it mentions cleaning a catch. The other options like table or kitchen drawer are not related to fishing, while pocket and board do not make sense in the context of cleaning a catch. Therefore, the correct answer must be fishing boat, which is the most logical vessel to use when cleaning a fish caught while fishing.
Answer:
fishing boat

Options: A) baking soda, B) barrels, C) pepper, D) salt, E) small town,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the pioneer is in need of specific baking supplies, and one common baking ingredient is baking soda. Barrels, pepper, and salt are unlikely to be used in baking, and small town is not a type of baking supply.
Answer:
baking soda

Options: A) determine word's definition, B) thesaurus, C) eat cake, D) novel, E) encyclopedia,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person worked extensively with a dictionary, which could indicate that they were writing a piece of literature that required a lot of research and attention to detail in their language use. The option "eat cake" is clearly not related to the context of the sentence, and the others could potentially be used for research in writing, but the use of a dictionary specifically points towards writing a novel as the best answer.
Answer:
novel

Options: A) new york city, B) toronto, C) large city, D) large city, E) metropolis,
Knowledge: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, commonly referred to as "the Met," is located in New York City.

Answer:
new york city

Knowledge: The sentence implies that George is in need of a place to stay, and the speaker offers to let him do so. The phrase "didn't have any place to go" indicates that George does not have a specific destination in mind, but needs a place to reside for the time being. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
Answer:
stay here

Options: A) talk to it, B) surf net, C) play cards, D) play chess, E) see new,
Knowledge: Boredom often prompts people to seek out entertainment or distractions. Of the given choices, "surf net" seems to be the most likely option for finding a variety of activities to alleviate boredom. Talking to a phone or seeing something new may not be effective ways to combat boredom. Playing cards or chess can be entertaining, but may not be readily available on a mobile phone.
Answer:
surf net

Question: Some kids are shy in school, so taking a shower where can be intimidating?
Options: A) bath room, B) motel room, C) pool, D) locker room, E) at hotel,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that taking a shower in a particular location can be intimidating for shy kids in school. The most likely location for this scenario is a locker room, where students often change and shower in a shared space. The other options, such as a bath room, motel room, pool, or hotel, do not typically involve shared shower facilities and are therefore less likely to be intimidating for shy kids.
Answer:
locker room
Question: John would do anything because he didn't care.  He would do what?
Options: A) fall down, B) surprise, C) matter to, D) whatever, E) run,
Knowledge: The sentence states that John would do anything, which suggests that he doesn't have any particular preference or care about what he does.

The other options do not have a clear connection to the sentence's meaning.
Answer:
whatever
Question: Where would you get an action figure if you do not have one?
Options: A) eat cake, B) little boy's toy box, C) theater, D) bathtub, E) toy store,
Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking about where to acquire an action figure. The options "eat cake," "theater," and "bathtub" do not provide a plausible answer to this question, as they are not places where one would typically find or purchase an action figure. However, "little boy's toy box" may seem like a possible answer, but it is not a guaranteed source of an action figure, whereas a toy store explicitly sells toys, including action figures.
Answer:
toy store
Question: He was studying anatomy, he knew that the main artery in his neck provided blood to his what?
Options: A) own brain, B) busy city, C) thruway, D) hand, E) neck,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is studying anatomy and is aware of the main artery in the neck. Given that the heart pumps blood to the rest of the body through arteries, it is likely that the person is referring to the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain. The other options, such as "busy city," "thruway," "hand," and "neck," do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
own brain
Question: Where can fungus grow on walls?
Options: A) shower stall, B) salad, C) locker room, D) basement, E) bathroom,
Knowledge: Fungus can grow in damp and humid environments, such as basements.

Answer:
basement
Question: John couldn't arise from his position, so he remained at his desk. What might his position be?
Options: A) get down, B) kneeling, C) lie down, D) lay down, E) sitting down,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was unable to stand up from his current position at his desk, which indicates that he was likely sitting down. The other options, such as kneeling or lying down, do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest a different posture altogether.
Answer:
sitting down
Question: Where might a child go who has no home?
Options: A) school, B) orphanage, C) most homes, D) recreational, E) pen,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the child in question does not have a home. Therefore, it is likely that the child would go to a place that provides shelter, such as an orphanage. Schools and recreational areas are not typically designed to provide long-term housing, and "most homes" does not make sense in the context provided. "Pen" is unlikely to be the correct answer as it does not provide any clues to a potential solution for a homeless child.
Answer:
orphanage
Question: Crabs crawl along the bottom of what?
Options: A) bodies of water, B) fish market, C) aquarium, D) saltwater, E) galapagos,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the crabs are moving along the bottom of some type of body of water. The options "fish market" and "aquarium" do not fit the context of the sentence, as crabs in those locations would not typically be crawling along the bottom of anything. "Saltwater" is a possibility, but it is too broad and does not provide enough specificity. "Galapagos" is also too specific and does not fit the general context of the sentence, which suggests that the crabs could be in any body of water. Therefore, the correct answer is "bodies of water."
Answer:
bodies of water
Question: Almost everyone who has been driving a car has seen or been in a what?
Options: A) getting tired, B) go somewhere, C) water pollute, D) backache, E) automobile accidents,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the event being described is a common experience for people who drive cars. The phrase "seen or been in" also suggests that it is an action or event that is witnessed or experienced by the driver. Among the given choices, only automobile accidents match these criteria, as they are a common occurrence and can be experienced by both drivers and passengers. The other choices do not fit the given context.
Answer:
automobile accidents
Question: His want for more was insatiable, a what wasn't enough?
Options: A) presence, B) overabundance, C) stockpile, D) plentitude, E) morman,
Knowledge: The sentence describes someone who has an insatiable desire for more, suggesting that they are never satisfied. The word "plentitude" means a fullness or abundance of something, which fits with the idea of always wanting more. "Presence," "overabundance," "stockpile," and "Mormon" do not accurately express this idea.
Answer:
plentitude
Question: Where can you buy grapes directly from their growers?
Options: A) grocery cart, B) kitchen, C) fridge, D) fruit market, E) super market,
Knowledge: The options that are related to household items or appliances such as grocery cart, kitchen, and fridge are not plausible choices as they do not sell fruit directly from growers. Supermarket could be a plausible answer, but it is a generic term that could refer to any type of grocery store. A fruit market, on the other hand, specifically suggests a place where fruits are sold, often directly by the growers themselves.
Answer:
fruit market
Question: He never took for granted living in the land of the free, for he was once a what abroad?
Options: A) caged in, B) see work, C) slavery, D) topfree, E) prisoner,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned had a newfound appreciation for living in a free country, implying that they were once deprived of their freedom. The word "abroad" suggests that this experience may have happened in a foreign country, which narrows down the potential options. "Prisoner" is the most fitting option, as it directly relates to loss of freedom and imprisonment. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
prisoner
Question: Most people have what which they use to carry things?
Options: A) two eyes, B) two hands, C) two arms, D) carry bags, E) ears,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people use something to carry things, which narrows the options down to "two hands" and "carry bags." However, the phrase "most people have" implies that the answer should be a natural part of the body rather than an external object. The other options, such as "two eyes," "ears," and "two arms" do not relate to carrying objects as directly as hands.
Answer:
two hands
Question: Nations agreeing with each other will lead to what?
Options: A) taco tuesday, B) like, C) problem, D) peace, E) contract,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when nations agree with each other, a positive outcome will result. The context implies that this outcome is likely to be a desirable one, which rules out options like "problem." Additionally, the sentence suggests that the outcome will involve cooperation and harmony, which makes "peace" the most logical answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
peace
Question: If I want to keep my floor covering down, what should I put the tack in?
Options: A) carpet, B) bulliten board, C) message board, D) bulletin board, E) wall,
Knowledge: The phrase "keep my floor covering down" suggests that the speaker wants to secure a material to the floor. The only option that is a type of floor covering is carpet, so the tack should be put into the carpet to keep it down. The other options are either not related to floor coverings or are not capable of holding anything down. Additionally, the correct spelling of the option is "bulletin board."
Answer:
carpet
Question: I was driving a car and had a heart attack at 80 mph, what awaits me?
Options: A) new car, B) wreak, C) getting somewhere, D) death, E) getting tired,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person driving the car had a heart attack while traveling at a high speed. This is a dangerous situation that can result in a serious accident and potentially a fatality, which would make death the most appropriate answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
death

Options: A) horns, B) two eyes, C) brown hair, D) drug problem, E) feelings,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trait being referred to is genetically determined and located on top of one's head. Out of the choices given, only brown hair fits this description. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
brown hair
Question: Where would you put condiments if you are planning to use them soon?
Options: A) kitchen, B) pantry, C) table, D) refrigerator, E) container,
Knowledge: Condiments are typically used to enhance the flavor of food and are often placed within easy reach during meals. The kitchen and pantry are storage areas and not typically where condiments are kept while in use. The refrigerator is used to keep condiments fresh and safe to consume over a longer period of time, but they may not be easily accessible if they are chilled. A container could be used to hold condiments but is not specific to the context of the question, whereas the table is the most common location for placing condiments within reach during meals.
Answer:
table
Question: Sally bought bubblegum. Where might she have gotten it?
Options: A) supermarket, B) theater, C) street, D) pocket, E) church,
Knowledge: The most likely place for Sally to buy bubblegum is a supermarket or grocery store. These types of stores typically carry a wide variety of candy and gum, and it is common for customers to pick up a pack of gum during a shopping trip. The other options are less likely scenarios for buying gum: theater might have concessions, but not typically bubblegum, street and pocket suggest that Sally obtained it somehow surreptitiously, and church is not a place typically associated with selling bubblegum.
Answer:
supermarket
Question: Where would you find a trash can while enjoying the great outdoors?
Options: A) water cooler, B) alley, C) park, D) food place, E) motel,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is enjoying the great outdoors, which suggests they are in a location where they would likely find a park. Parks often have trash cans available for visitors to dispose of their waste, making it the most likely choice among the options given. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
park

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James' deli is located in a city with a significant history, which is often associated with New York City.

Answer:
new york city

Options: A) controvertible, B) interesting, C) easy, D) agreeable, E) bearable,

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence: controvertible means open to dispute, interesting means engaging or stimulating, easy means not difficult, and agreeable means pleasant or enjoyable.
Answer:
bearable
Question: Where is the sky fake?
Options: A) shed, B) atmosphere, C) photo, D) outdoors, E) planetarium,
Knowledge: The options shed, atmosphere, photo, and outdoors are all natural settings where the sky is not considered to be fake. In a planetarium, however, the sky is artificially created using projectors and screens, which means that it is not the real sky seen outdoors. Therefore, the correct answer is planetarium.
Answer:
planetarium

Options: A) being watched, B) you're scared, C) were religious, D) god hears, E) talk to god,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason the players knelt to pray was related to their religiosity, as the action of praying is typically associated with religious practice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as there is no indication that the players were being watched, scared, or trying to communicate with a god who hears them.
Answer:
were religious
Question: What is the name of a place where cargo is stored?
Options: A) at sea, B) ship's hold, C) aeroplane, D) airplane, E) boat,
Knowledge: The phrase "cargo" suggests that the answer is related to transportation or storage of goods. The option "at sea" is not specific enough and could refer to any location on the water. "Aeroplane" and "airplane" are modes of transportation that are not typically associated with cargo storage. "Boat" is a general term that does not specify a type of storage location. "Ship's hold" is a specific term used to describe the lower part of a ship where cargo is stored.
Answer:
ship's hold
Question: Visiting museum was an emotional experience for the old veteran, he hid it best he could but he began to what?
Options: A) cry, B) whisper, C) appriciation, D) take pictures, E) feeling proud,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the visit to the museum evoked strong emotions in the old veteran, and he tried to hide it. Crying is a common physical manifestation of emotional distress, and therefore the correct answer. The other options do not have the same emotional connotation as crying and do not match the context of the sentence.
Answer:
cry
Question: The rooms in the experimental home were quite unique, they weren't the traditional what?
Options: A) posessions in, B) high walls, C) doors and windows, D) triangles, E) square shape,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the rooms in the experimental home had a feature that set them apart from traditional rooms. The use of the word "unique" suggests that this feature was unusual or unexpected. The option "square shape" makes the most sense in this context, as traditional rooms are typically square or rectangular in shape. The other options ("possessions in," "high walls," "doors and windows," and "triangles") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
square shape
Question: How does one decide if instituting a particular civil action is fair?
Options: A) restitution, B) anger, C) trial, D) court case, E) confusion,
Knowledge: The word "fair" suggests that a process or system is being assessed for its impartiality and justice. In civil law, a trial is a judicial proceeding in which evidence is presented, witnesses are called, and a decision is made by a judge or jury based on the facts of the case. A trial is considered a fair and impartial way to reach a decision because both sides have an opportunity to present their case, and the decision is based on the evidence presented. The other options do not relate to the idea of assessing fairness in a civil action.
Answer:
trial
Question: What happens after eating dinner?
Options: A) heart burn, B) become tired, C) become full, D) flatulence, E) indigestion,
Knowledge: Eating dinner typically results in the feeling of being full, as the body begins to digest the food. Heartburn and indigestion may occur if the food is not properly digested, but these symptoms are not always present after eating dinner. Becoming tired may also happen after eating, but it is not a universal occurrence and thus isn't a reliable answer. Flatulence can happen, but it is not a commonly experienced effect of eating dinner.
Answer:
become full
Question: What would cause a ship to stop moving?
Options: A) near shore, B) a romulian space craft, C) sail on sea, D) heading east, E) run aground,
Knowledge: Running aground means that a ship has hit the seabed, reef or any other underwater obstacle, causing it to stop moving forward. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. "Near shore" or "sail on sea" do not necessarily mean a ship will stop moving. "A Romulian space craft" is a reference to Star Trek and is not a realistic scenario. "Heading east" does not provide any relevant information about why a ship would stop moving.
Answer:
run aground
Question: What is a train-related expression for exhaustion?
Options: A) have rest, B) run out of steam, C) go to sleep, D) tuckered out, E) stay in bed,
Knowledge: "Run out of steam" is a common idiomatic expression that means to become exhausted or to lose energy. This expression is often associated with trains because steam locomotives require a constant supply of steam to operate, and if the steam supply runs out, the train will stop moving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of trains or exhaustion.
Answer:
run out of steam
Question: Where would you find a lot of beds?
Options: A) bedford, B) rest area, C) neighbor's house, D) hospital, E) loft,
Knowledge: Hospitals are commonly associated with beds because they are used to provide a comfortable resting place for patients. Rest areas may have some beds, but not as many as hospitals. Bedford is a place name, not related to beds. The neighbor's house and loft may have beds, but it is unlikely there would be a lot of them.
Answer:
hospital
Question: What might having a check up lead to for some people?
Options: A) pain, B) good behavior, C) uncertainty, D) anxiety, E) stress,
Knowledge: The question implies that there may be negative consequences associated with having a medical checkup. Anxiety is a common emotional response to medical appointments, as people may be worried about their health or the possibility of receiving bad news. Pain is a possibility, but not necessarily a common outcome of a checkup, and good behavior and uncertainty do not make sense in this context. Stress is a possibility, but anxiety is a more specific and commonly associated emotion with medical checkups.
Answer:
anxiety
Question: He was competing for the prestigious prize, though it had no money, what was he seeking by attempting to get it?
Options: A) enemies, B) rivalry, C) bad blood, D) accomplishment, E) game,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the prize being competed for is prestigious, which implies that it is highly regarded and respected. The fact that the prize has no money suggests that it is not a financial award, but rather a recognition of achievement or excellence. The word "competing" also implies that the individual is seeking to attain something of value, which points towards accomplishment as the correct answer. The other options, such as enemies, rivalry, or bad blood, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be associated with a prestigious prize.
Answer:
accomplishment
Question: The flour was stored away from the kids so they couldn't play with it, where was it?
Options: A) pantry, B) grocery store, C) cupboard, D) kitchen, E) table,
Knowledge: The word "stored" suggests that the flour was kept in a designated place for safekeeping. The options "grocery store" and "table" are unlikely because they suggest a public space or a communal area, whereas the sentence implies that the flour was being kept in a private household. The options "cupboard" and "kitchen" are possible but not as specific as "pantry," which is a dedicated storage space for food in many homes.
Answer:
pantry
Question: The teacher explained it used a cathode ray tube like other screens, but this what measured things?
Options: A) vacuum tube, B) television, C) computer, D) cathode ray, E) oscilloscope,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher is explaining a type of screen that uses a cathode ray tube, which is a type of vacuum tube commonly used in older technology. However, the sentence also specifies that this screen is used to measure things, which suggests that it is an oscilloscope, which is a device used to graphically display and analyze electronic signals. The other options, such as television and computer, do not typically use an oscilloscope for their display.
Answer:
oscilloscope
Question: If a contract is not signed it will be?
Options: A) rejected, B) dumb, C) written on paper, D) signed, E) revised,
Knowledge: The question implies that there is a consequence for not signing a contract. Typically, if a contract is not signed, it is considered incomplete and therefore invalid. That means it can be rejected, as it lacks the necessary signature(s) to make it legally enforceable. The other options do not make sense in this context - "dumb" is slang and unrelated, "written on paper" is obvious and not a consequence, "signed" is the opposite of what is being discussed, and "revised" implies that the contract has already been changed or edited, which is not mentioned in the question.
Answer:
rejected
Question: Where can you find cord along side nails and bolts?
Options: A) delivery room, B) garage, C) sporting goods store, D) office, E) hardware store,
Knowledge: The combination of cord, nails, and bolts suggests that this is a location where hardware or DIY supplies are sold. The delivery room, sporting goods store, and office do not typically stock these items, so they can be eliminated. The garage could be a possibility, but it is not a specific enough answer - many different types of items could be stored in a garage. Therefore, the best choice is the hardware store, as this is where one would expect to find all three of these items together.
Answer:
hardware store
Question: The climber was suffering elevation sickness, his wits were suffering what?
Options: A) diminishment, B) reduction, C) depression, D) demotion, E) disgust,
Knowledge: Elevation sickness is a condition caused by exposure to high altitudes, which can cause a number of symptoms including headache, fatigue, and confusion. The word "wits" in the sentence refers to the climber's mental faculties, which may be affected by elevation sickness. The word "diminishment" means a reduction or decrease in something, which accurately describes the climber's situation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the meaning of the word "wits."
Answer:
diminishment
Question: James was watching TV when he saw flashing lights that did something bad to him.  What might john have had?
Options: A) falling asleep, B) entertainment, C) scared him, D) headache, E) seizure,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions flashing lights causing something bad to happen to James.

The other options do not have any clear connection to seizures or flashing lights.
Answer:

Question: How much money should we print if we want to fight inflation?
Options: A) happiness, B) sense of accomplishment, C) not very much, D) dissatisfaction, E) saving money,

Answer:
not very much
Question: What must someone have in order to shop?
Options: A) have money, B) sleep, C) bring flowers, D) go to market, E) get money,
Knowledge: Shopping involves purchasing goods or services, which requires a form of payment. Money is the most commonly used method of payment, which is why it is necessary for someone to have money in order to shop. The other options, such as sleeping or bringing flowers, are not related to the act of shopping. "Get money" could be a possible answer, but it is less specific than "have money" and doesn't clarify from where the money should come.
Answer:
have money

Options: A) manipulate, B) show affection, C) companion, D) seperate, E) electrical circuit,

This likely refers to a simple way to show affection or greeting, which is a common custom in many cultures. The other options (manipulate, companion, separate, electrical circuit) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
show affection
Question: There was a dog, it was barking loudly.  James wasn't scared of it though, because it was confined.  Where might it have been confined to?
Options: A) backyard, B) kitchen cupboard, C) front door, D) table, E) park,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the dog was barking loudly, but James was not scared because it was confined. The most likely place for a dog to be confined would be a backyard since it allows the dog some room to move around while still being enclosed. The other options - kitchen cupboard, front door, table, and park - do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not provide a suitable place for a dog to be confined.
Answer:
backyard
Question: The magician guessed it was a king, he was very good with a what?
Options: A) hierarchy, B) court, C) chess game, D) deck of cards, E) chess set,
Knowledge: The context suggests that the magician was able to make a guess about the identity of something or someone based on his skills. The choices "hierarchy" and "court" are less likely to be linked to such a guess. Additionally, the term "game" is used twice in the sentence, suggesting that the answer may be related to a game. The options "chess game" and "chess set" are related to chess, but the magician may not necessarily have been good at chess. Thus, the most appropriate option would be "deck of cards" as this is a game commonly associated with magicians and guessing games.
Answer:
deck of cards
Question: If you see cars with a light blinking on the driver's side what does that indicate they will do?
Options: A) slow down, B) go forward, C) get to town, D) turn left, E) turn right,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the blinking light is located on the driver's side of the car, which is typically where the turn signal is located. The options "slow down," "go forward," and "get to town" do not make sense as they do not involve the use of a turn signal. The remaining options, "turn left" and "turn right," both involve the use of a turn signal, but the position of the blinking light on the driver's side suggests that the driver intends to turn left.
Answer:
turn left
Question: If a person is looking at houses, what is their end goal?
Options: A) own property, B) cross street, C) bring home, D) will succeed, E) mortgage,
Knowledge: The context of the question implies that the person is interested in houses, which suggests that their end goal is to become a homeowner and own a property. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context and do not align with the goal of purchasing a home.
Answer:
own property

Options: A) ranch, B) tennessee, C) barnyard, D) switzerland, E) antarctica,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the dairy cow farm provided milk for a big chocolate company, which suggests that the company is located in Switzerland. Switzerland is known for its chocolate production, so it is likely that the company mentioned in the sentence is based there. The other options do not have any clear connection to the dairy or chocolate industries.

The other options, such as self esteem, compliments, easy life, and fulfillment, are not things that one typically seeks out at a restaurant.

Answer:
delicious food

Answer:

Options: A) painting, B) aviary, C) rural area, D) zoo, E) colorado,
Knowledge: Bald eagles are known to live in areas with access to bodies of water, as they primarily feed on fish. Rural areas can offer ample access to both water and undisturbed natural habitats, making them a more likely location to spot a wild bald eagle. The other options, such as painting, zoo, and aviary, do not offer live views of a bald eagle in a natural setting. While it is possible to see bald eagles in Colorado, the question does not provide any specific location or context, so it would be safer to choose the general answer of "rural area."
Answer:
rural area
Question: The drawing room was one of fifty rooms, where was it located?
Options: A) kid's house, B) studio, C) large house, D) house in england, E) mansion,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the drawing room was one of fifty rooms, which suggests that it was located in a large house rather than a smaller residence such as a kid's house or a studio. The options "house in England" and "mansion" could both potentially refer to a large house, but there is no clear context or information in the sentence to suggest that the location was specifically in England or that it was a grand and luxurious mansion.
Answer:
large house

Options: A) opt out, B) separate, C) opt out, D) leave, E) split apart,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there wasn't enough space for Samantha to join the game, which implies that someone else was already playing. Therefore, for Samantha to join, someone else had to leave in order to free up space. The other options do not make sense in this context.

Options: A) throw up, B) food, C) coffee, D) stumble, E) food,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is watching his calorie intake, which means he likely wants to reduce his overall consumption of calories. Since the drink was very sweet, it probably contained a lot of sugar or other sweeteners that can contribute significantly to one's daily caloric intake. In order to offset this, John may want to consume less food overall to keep his calorie count in check. The other options, such as throwing up or stumbling, do not logically connect to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Options: A) lead pencil, B) black, C) very heavy, D) news article, E) card game,
Knowledge: Graphite is commonly used as the core material in pencils, which are traditionally made with a wooden barrel and an eraser at the end. However, despite its name, "lead" is not actually used in pencils anymore due to its toxicity. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "lead pencil" since it reflects the common usage of graphite in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
lead pencil
Question: Where would you go to see a sword?
Options: A) container called scabbard, B) school, C) collection, D) museum, E) sheath,
Knowledge: A sword is a type of weapon or tool that is typically displayed in museums or collections.

Therefore, the correct answer is museum.
Answer:
museum
Question: He was a bit of an audiophile, he replaced the stylus almost as often as he switched albums to listen to on his what?
Options: A) record player, B) palm pilot, C) hand, D) ink, E) fridge,

The term "audiophile" refers to someone who is passionate about high-quality sound reproduction.

The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Options: A) garden, B) new mexico books, C) tropics, D) china, E) forrest,
Knowledge: Lizards are cold-blooded animals that require warmth to regulate their body temperature.

A garden, for example, could be cool or damp, while a forest may offer shade and shelter but not necessarily the warmth that a lizard needs to thrive.
Answer:
tropics
Question: What does everyone try their whole life to be?
Options: A) sad, B) happy, C) grow old, D) cat, E) believed,
Knowledge: The question asks what everyone tries their whole life to be. This suggests that the answer is a universal goal or desire. We can eliminate options like "sad" and "cat" because they are not something people actively strive for. "Grow old" is a natural process that happens to everyone, but not necessarily something they try to achieve. "Believed" does not make sense in this context. This leaves us with "happy," which is a common goal for people, suggesting that it is the correct answer.
Answer:
happy
Question: What causes meeting people to be preceded by meditation?
Options: A) being bored, B) panic attack, C) anxiety, D) making new friends, E) love,
Knowledge: The word "preceded" suggests that the act of meditation comes before meeting people, indicating that it is done to prepare for the social interaction. The context suggests that this preparation is due to a negative feeling or state, and the option "anxiety" is commonly linked to social anxiety, which can lead someone to feel overwhelmed by social interactions. The other options, such as "love" or "making new friends," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
anxiety
Question: Where would you go to argue about important bills?

Options: A) supermarket, B) grocery store, C) walmart, D) church, E) bathroom,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lady needs to buy a lot of items and has limited time, so she needs to go to a place where she can find many things in one location. Supermarkets are known for offering a wide variety of items, including groceries, household goods, and personal care products, all in one place, making them a convenient option for someone with limited time. The other options do not fit the criteria of offering a wide variety of items in one location.
Answer:
supermarket

Options: A) icy cold, B) own home, C) garage, D) freeze food, E) appliance store,
Knowledge: The question is asking where to obtain a freezer, which implies that the person currently does not have one. The options "icy cold," "own home," and "garage" do not make sense as places to obtain a freezer. "Freeze food" is also incorrect because it describes an action (freezing food) rather than a location or source. The correct answer is "appliance store" because they sell refrigerators and freezers.
Answer:
appliance store

Options: A) kitchen, B) military base, C) shelf, D) neighbor's house, E) restroom,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny had to seek food from someone else, which implies that there was another household nearby.

Answer:
neighbor's house
Question: What happens when friends observe something at the same time?
Options: A) travel together, B) borrow money, C) conspire, D) visit each other, E) see like,
Knowledge: The word "observe" in the sentence suggests that the friends are looking at something together, and the phrase "at the same time" suggests that they are seeing the same thing.

Options: A) home, B) airport, C) skyscraper, D) castle, E) every building,
Knowledge: Castles are known for their large wooden doors, which were often reinforced with iron or other sturdy materials to protect against invaders. While some homes may have large wooden doors, it is less common than in castles. Airports and skyscrapers typically have automatic sliding doors or revolving doors made of glass or metal, and not wooden doors. "Every building" is too broad of a category and cannot be inferred from the question.
Answer:
castle
Question: What is the best course of action for a person to take if they want to get up early?
Options: A) go to bed early, B) fix up alarm, C) go sleep early, D) dawn, E) ask spouse to wake,
Knowledge: Getting up early requires going to bed early as well so that the body can have enough rest and energy for the day ahead. Fixing an alarm can only remind a person to wake up, but it does not guarantee that they will have the energy to start their day. "Go sleep early" is not a grammatically correct option, and "dawn" is not a practical solution as it is not an action that a person can take. Asking a spouse to wake a person up can put unnecessary pressure on the spouse and may not be reliable. Therefore, the best course of action for a person to take if they want to get up early is to go to bed early.
Answer:
go to bed early
Question: Art, playing music, and other hobbies are great ways of expressing yourself that can be great what?
Options: A) fight, B) communication, C) fun, D) understood, E) suffering,

Answer:

Options: A) adequate, B) poormouth, C) rich, D) enough, E) good,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the living conditions in the building were not great, but it also suggests that the building did meet minimum standards for habitation. The word "barely" indicates that the building met only the most basic requirements for safety and functionality. The word "adequate" means sufficient for a given purpose or need, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options either contradict the context of the sentence or are irrelevant.
Answer:
adequate
Question: Where can you buy clothing, sporting goods, and housewares?
Options: A) backpack, B) house, C) department store, D) mall, E) table,
Knowledge: The items listed in the question are commonly found in a department store, which typically sells a wide variety of products under one roof. A backpack, house, and table are not typically sold together in the same location, and a mall usually has individual stores rather than a singular department store.
Answer:
department store
Question: Where can you take your kids to buy things for them to play with?
Options: A) disneyland, B) jungle, C) swimming pool, D) toy store, E) home,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a place to buy toys for their kids to play with. Disneyland and the jungle are not typically associated with buying toys, while a swimming pool is a place to swim rather than buy toys. Home is also an unlikely option as the sentence implies that the speaker wants to take their kids somewhere to buy toys. A toy store is therefore the correct answer as it is the most logical choice for buying toys.
Answer:
toy store
Question: When a person climbs a mountain and is breathing fresh air, which feeling are they likely to have?
Options: A) exhilaration, B) clear head, C) feeling better, D) reviving, E) happiness,

The other options may also be associated with climbing a mountain, but do not capture the specific feeling of excitement and energy that is implied.
Answer:
exhilaration

Options: A) unexpected results, B) bugs, C) satisfaction, D) frustration, E) aggrevation,
Knowledge: The word "unsuccessful" suggests that the writing program did not achieve its intended purpose, which is likely to cause frustration for the user. Bugs and unexpected results are possible consequences of an unsuccessful program, but they do not necessarily relate directly to the user's experience of frustration. Satisfaction and aggravation are unlikely outcomes of a program that did not work as intended.
Answer:
frustration
Question: Where is a flute likely to be in a pit?
Options: A) party, B) orchestra, C) musical instrument store, D) marching band, E) symphony,
Knowledge: The term "pit" commonly refers to the area in front of a stage where the orchestra is situated. It is where musicians play music for plays, operas, and musicals that require live instrumental accompaniment. Flutes are commonly used in orchestras, which makes it likely that they can be found in a pit. The other answer choices do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Options: A) swiss cheese, B) football ground, C) ground, D) golf course, E) wall,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action of making a hole with one's fist is associated with a solid surface that can be punched through. Swiss cheese and golf courses do not have solid surfaces that someone could make a hole in with their fist. A football ground or plain ground could potentially have a solid surface, but it is not specifically mentioned in the sentence. A wall, however, is a solid surface that someone could make a hole in with their fist.
Answer:
wall
Question: If you legs are tired and you need to have a rest you should do what?
Options: A) sleep, B) sit down, C) go to bed, D) run, E) closing eyes,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is already standing or walking, and their legs are tired. Sleeping or going to bed are not appropriate options as they are not practical in the moment. Running would only make the situation worse. Closing eyes is not mentioned in the context of the sentence and cannot be assumed to be a solution to tired legs. Sitting down is the most appropriate option as it will allow the person to rest their legs and take a break from standing or walking.
Answer:
sit down
Question: What happens to most people after playing tennis all day?
Options: A) championship, B) becoming tired, C) tennis elbow, D) victory, E) friends,

Answer:

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person who stayed over after having sex with the man woke up in his house the next morning. The man got up early to do something, which suggests that it was morning and he was starting his day. The most logical thing for someone to do in the morning is to eat breakfast, so it can be inferred that the man made breakfast for the person who spent the night. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
eat breakfast
Question: When having food it is common to do what other act of consumption?
Options: A) drinking, B) playing poker, C) sit, D) talk, E) being greedy,

The context of the sentence involves murder, which is a violent and traumatic experience that can cause great emotional pain and suffering. The other options, except for "terrible," which is a vague adjective that does not clearly indicate an emotion or feeling, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Remorse" refers to a feeling of guilt or regret, "retaliation" refers to taking revenge or seeking justice, and "wet" is a physical sensation that does not relate to the emotional state of the family members.
Answer:
anguish

The other options, such as ocean or awards ceremony, do not have any direct correlation with John's abilities as an omnidisciplinarian.
Answer:

The other options do not provide a feasible solution for going through a closed door. "Keep people out" suggests preventing others from entering, "enclose cupboard" suggests placing something inside a confined space, "teleport" is a fictional concept that is not possible in reality, and "glass" is a material used for windows and barriers but does not relate to going through a door.
Answer:

Question: If you're wet cleaning a floor while doing housework, what do you need?
Options: A) fan, B) energy, C) vacuuming, D) mop, E) broom,
Knowledge: Wet cleaning a floor requires a tool that can absorb water and clean up dirt and grime, such as a mop. A fan and energy are not cleaning tools, and vacuuming is typically used for dry cleaning of floors. A broom is also not suitable for wet cleaning as it will just spread the water and dirt around.
Answer:
mop
Question: Beautiful lightning strikes happen on what kind of day?
Options: A) november, B) rainy, C) dull, D) wet, E) average,
Knowledge: The word "beautiful" suggests that the lightning strikes are not viewed as dangerous or destructive. Rainy days are often associated with thunderstorms and lightning, making it the most likely choice. November and average days do not have any specific weather associations or characteristics that suggest beautiful lightning strikes, making them unlikely options. Dull and wet are both negative adjectives and do not fit with the positive connotation of "beautiful."
Answer:
rainy
Question: Drinking alcohol can make me lose this?
Options: A) socialize, B) eating, C) fool, D) dance, E) sleep at night,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that drinking alcohol can have a negative impact on a specific activity or function.

The remaining option, "sleep at night," is a common problem associated with alcohol consumption and is often cited as a reason to limit or avoid drinking.
Answer:
sleep at night

Options: A) bad time, B) closing eyes, C) answering question, D) stopping to think, E) forgetting,
Knowledge: The question is asking about a strategy to ensure that one is remembering something, which suggests that the other options are unlikely to be effective. Closing one's eyes and answering a question are not necessarily related to memory, while "bad time" and "forgetting" are not strategies at all. "Stopping to think" is a common technique for recalling information, as it allows one to focus their attention and retrieve relevant details from their memory.
Answer:
stopping to think
Question: Where can I drink beer or any other alcoholic beverage?
Options: A) bar, B) vending machine, C) bottle, D) refrigerator, E) hockey game,
Knowledge: Bars are commonly associated with serving alcoholic beverages, while vending machines, bottles, refrigerators, and hockey games do not necessarily have any connection to alcohol consumption.

Answer:
bar
Question: After killing people in a rage what is someone likely to feel?
Options: A) stomach ache, B) retaliation, C) sadness, D) remorse, E) going to jail,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has killed people in a state of anger or fury, which commonly leads to feelings of guilt or regret after the violent act is committed. Remorse, which means deep regret or guilt for a wrong committed, is the most appropriate choice among the options considering the context of the sentence. Stomach ache and retaliation do not make logical sense in this context, while sadness is not a strong enough emotion to describe the severity of the situation. Going to jail is a consequence of the action and not a feeling.
Answer:

Question: Who is likely to use too much salt?
Options: A) shaker, B) fast food restaurant, C) kitchen cupboard, D) people, E) table,
Knowledge: The question suggests that someone or something may be using too much salt, and the options given each represent a possible culprit. A shaker or kitchen cupboard may be used by individuals who have control over the amount of salt they add to their food, making it unlikely that they would use too much. "People" is too broad and does not provide specific information. A table is an inanimate object and cannot use salt. A fast food restaurant, however, is known for using high amounts of salt in their food to enhance flavor and preserve freshness, making it the most likely answer.
Answer:
fast food restaurant
Question: What did the friendly man do when meeting knew people to show he was happy?
Options: A) say hello, B) start a conversation, C) introducing yourself, D) shake hands, E) smiling,
Knowledge: The question suggests that the friendly man did something specific to show that he was happy when meeting new people. Out of the given choices, the act of smiling is most commonly associated with expressing happiness and friendliness when meeting someone new. While saying hello, starting a conversation, and shaking hands are all common social interactions, they do not necessarily indicate happiness on their own. Introducing oneself is also a common social norm, but it does not necessarily suggest a person's level of happiness.
Answer:
smiling

Options: A) outer space, B) horizon, C) beach, D) west, E) beans,
Knowledge: The sun sets in the west, which is a well-known fact based on the direction of the earth's rotation and the position of the sun in relation to the horizon. The other options, such as outer space and beans, are irrelevant and do not provide any helpful information.
Answer:
west
Question: What is likely to someone in a skiing accident likely to have in more than one place?
Options: A) frost bite, B) broken bones, C) chapped lips, D) healthy body, E) broken legs,
Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is related to injuries sustained in a skiing accident, and broken bones are a common injury in such accidents. Frost bite and chapped lips are possible consequences of prolonged exposure to cold weather, but they may not necessarily be present in multiple places. A healthy body is not an injury, and broken legs are not necessarily present in more than one place.
Answer:
broken bones
Question: John tried his best to care for Kate, but Kate kept throwing herself into danger.  He couldn't stand her what for her own safety?
Options: A) unfeeling, B) disregard, C) indifferent, D) neglect, E) apathetic,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite John's efforts to care for Kate, she repeatedly put herself in danger. The word that fits best in the blank should convey a lack of concern for her own safety, which is indicated by the fact that she kept putting herself in harm's way. The options "neglect" and "apathetic" also convey a lack of care, but "disregard" is a better fit in the context of the sentence. The options "unfeeling" and "indifferent" do not necessarily imply a lack of concern for safety, and so are not the best choices.
Answer:
disregard
Question: The agent of change had a loath feeling for the king, he would set for a plan to have him what?
Options: A) recycled, B) inclined, C) disposed, D) avid, E) enthusiastic,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the agent of change has a negative feeling towards the king and is planning to do something to him. "Disposed" means to get rid of something or someone, which fits the context of the sentence indicating that the agent of change is planning to get rid of the king. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
disposed
Question: A poet may need to go where to achieve learning as an adult?
Options: A) classroom, B) english class, C) university, D) book store, E) home,
Knowledge: The phrase "achieve learning as an adult" implies that the poet is seeking higher education or advanced learning opportunities. While it's possible to learn outside of a university setting, the other options given (classroom, English class, book store, and home) do not necessarily suggest a formal, structured environment suited for adult learners. Additionally, universities are well-known for offering a variety of programs and courses that can accommodate different interests and goals.
Answer:
university
Question: Where would a kitchen towel be found?
Options: A) cupboard, B) at hotel, C) linen closet, D) under a rock, E) locker room,
Knowledge: Kitchen towels are commonly used in the kitchen for a variety of purposes such as drying dishes and wiping countertops. Therefore, it is more likely that it would be found in a location that is easily accessible from the kitchen, such as a cupboard or a drawer. The other options, such as hotel, linen closet, under a rock, or locker room, do not have any direct relevance to the context of the question.
Answer:
cupboard
Question: Answering questions followed by saying, "sir" or "ma'am" is an indication that you are what?
Options: A) irritation, B) correct, C) responding, D) polite, E) sadness,
Knowledge: The use of "sir" or "ma'am" after answering a question is a common sign of respect and formality, suggesting that the speaker is being courteous and well-mannered. The other options (irritation, correct, responding, sadness) do not align with this type of behavior and are therefore unlikely to be the correct answer.
Answer:
polite
Question: Matt had issues controlling his anger, what did he do when someone set him off?
Options: A) destroy enemy, B) punch, C) cool off, D) write letter, E) illustrate point,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Matt had difficulty controlling his anger, which implies that he may have had a physical reaction when someone triggered him. Punching someone is a common physical response when someone is angry and feels out of control. The other options do not align with this context - destroying an enemy, writing letters, and illustrating points are all more strategic or intellectual responses rather than physical ones. Cooling off is a more neutral option, but it doesn't necessarily suggest any action or behavior on Matt's part.
Answer:
punch
Question: When two people are doing the same thing, what do they tend to do?
Options: A) read stories, B) compete, C) help, D) solve problems, E) give orders,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when two people are doing the same thing, they tend to compete. Competing is a common behavior when two people are competing for the same thing or working towards the same goal. The other options, such as helping or giving orders, do not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
compete
Question: After checking in at the ticket office the couple entered their prom in the school's what?
Options: A) movie theaters, B) end of line, C) football field, D) auditorium, E) opera house,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the couple entered their "prom," which is a school dance typically held indoors. The options "movie theaters," "end of line," "football field," and "opera house" are all outdoor venues or places that do not typically host school dances. "Auditorium" is the most fitting option as it is commonly used as a venue for school events such as dances, concerts, and theater performances.
Answer:
auditorium
Question: The hipsters tried to take a disingenuous kooky approach to their cafe, they were soon out of business to the competitor who took what kind of approach?
Options: A) mainstream, B) straight, C) right, D) conventional, E) uneccentric,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hipsters took a disingenuous and kooky approach to their cafe, which implies that they were trying to be different or unique in a forced or insincere way. This approach may have alienated potential customers or made it difficult for them to understand what the cafe was all about. The sentence also suggests that the competitor took a different approach that allowed them to succeed, and since the other choices all suggest some form of alignment with the hipster approach, the correct answer is conventional, which suggests a more straightforward and traditional approach that is more likely to appeal to a wider range of customers.
Answer:
conventional
Question: Where is a ballpoint pen best stored?
Options: A) pocket, B) stationery store, C) backpack, D) desk drawer, E) bank,
Knowledge: The question is asking for the best place to store a ballpoint pen, which implies that it is a long-term storage location rather than a temporary one. The other answer choices don't seem like logical locations for long-term storage of a pen. A pocket could lead to loss or damage, a stationery store is where one would buy the pen, a backpack is a transportation method, and a bank has no clear connection to pen storage. Therefore, a desk drawer, where one would store office supplies, seems to be the most appropriate choice.
Answer:
desk drawer
Question: If you cut when waiting at the ticket office, what should your punishment be?
Options: A) auditorium, B) humans, C) opera house, D) death, E) end of line,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that cutting in line at the ticket office is unacceptable and may result in a punishment. The phrase "end of line" is often used as a warning to those who try to cut in line and suggests that they will be sent to the back. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
end of line
Question: Success is usually a product of preparation and what?
Options: A) awards ceremony, B) various situations, C) vocation, D) working hard, E) promotion,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that success is achieved through preparation and some other factor, which is likely to be related to putting in effort or hard work. Working hard is a commonly recognized factor in success, and is also a general term that can apply to any field or situation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are not commonly recognized as factors in success.
Answer:
working hard
Question: The key to happiness while living life is to do more than what?
Options: A) existing, B) happiness, C) early death, D) acquiring knowledge, E) being idle,
Knowledge: The question is asking for the opposite of the key to happiness while living life. The sentence suggests that simply existing is not enough to achieve happiness, implying that one must do more than just exist. The other options (happiness, early death, acquiring knowledge, being idle) do not provide a clear opposite to the key to happiness.
Answer:
existing
Question: He had said he would cook dinner, but first he needed to what?
Options: A) hungry, B) buy a kitchen, C) buy food, D) buy groceries, E) eat food,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to purchase something before they can cook dinner. This implies that they do not have the ingredients they need, so they must go out and buy them. The option "buy a kitchen" is unlikely, as it does not make sense to buy a new kitchen in order to cook dinner. The option "hungry" is incorrect, as it is unlikely that someone would need to be hungry to cook dinner. The options "buy food" and "eat food" are also incorrect, as they suggest that the person already has food but must either purchase or consume it.
Answer:
buy groceries
Question: If I go to a bank to get money, where could I go next to get household items and food?
Options: A) city, B) financial center, C) main street, D) grocery store, E) salon,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after getting money from a bank, the next location would be one where household items and food can be purchased. A grocery store is the most likely option as it offers a wide variety of food and household essentials. The other options (city, financial center, main street, salon) do not necessarily have anything to do with purchasing household items and food.
Answer:
grocery store
Question: If someone is free from guilt what are they likely to achieve?
Options: A) peaceful sleep, B) freedom from want, C) medal, D) headache, E) new computer,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being free from guilt can have a positive effect on a person's well-being. Guilt can create feelings of anxiety and unrest, which may impact a person's ability to sleep peacefully. Therefore, it is likely that if someone is free from guilt, they are more likely to achieve peaceful sleep. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
peaceful sleep
Question: Danny hasn't experienced all that it means to be human yet.  He is missing something important.  What might he be missing?
Options: A) space shuttle, B) library, C) school, D) love, E) wife,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that Danny has not fully experienced what it means to be human, which suggests that he may be missing an emotional or interpersonal element. The option "love" fits this description, as it is a fundamental human emotion that is often seen as a defining characteristic of the human experience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
love
Question: What is it called when two people have the same point of view?
Options: A) make love, B) when they hug, C) shake hands, D) agree with each other, E) work together,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a term that describes when two people have the same point of view. "Agree with each other" is the only option that directly reflects this meaning. "Make love" and "when they hug" are unrelated to having the same point of view, while "shake hands" and "work together" may indicate a level of cooperation, but not necessarily a shared perspective.
Answer:
agree with each other
Question: Where might people gather while they are waiting for a ride across town?
Options: A) wedding, B) bus stop, C) convention, D) pool, E) apartment,
Knowledge: The question suggests that people are waiting for a ride across town, which is most commonly associated with public transportation. A bus stop is a specific location where people gather to catch a bus, taxi or other forms of public transportation. The other options, such as a wedding, convention, pool or apartment, do not have any clear connection to people waiting for transportation across town.
Answer:
bus stop
Question: I want to make a fortune selling houses, what should I study?
Options: A) real estate, B) treasure chest, C) stock market, D) business, E) bank,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person wants to make money by selling houses, which is a key area of focus within the field of real estate. Studying real estate will provide the person with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the market, understand property values, and negotiate deals. The other options listed are not directly related to the real estate industry and would not provide the necessary knowledge to sell houses.
Answer:
real estate
Question: If there are people watching a priest, what is he doing?
Options: A) on trial, B) drink coffee, C) believe in god, D) baptise, E) say mass,
Knowledge: Priests are commonly associated with performing religious rituals or ceremonies, such as saying mass or baptising individuals. The context of the sentence suggests that the priest is in front of a gathering of people, which may indicate that he is performing a public ceremony. The other options, such as drinking coffee or being on trial, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
say mass
Question: What can you do while driving to work that involves sound but does not require you to move your mouth?
Options: A) anger, B) listen to radio, C) speed, D) sing, E) statue,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity must involve sound but not require movement of the mouth while driving to work. Anger and speed are not activities that involve sound, while singing requires movement of the mouth. A statue is a stationary object and not an activity. Therefore, the correct answer is listening to the radio, as it involves hearing sounds but does not require movement of the mouth.
Answer:
listen to radio
Question: What form of government is most associated with kingdoms?
Options: A) monarchy, B) ruled by government, C) europe, D) book, E) king,
Knowledge: A monarchy is a form of government where a king or queen serves as the head of state. The term "kingdom" suggests a country or territory that is ruled by a monarch, making monarchy the most closely associated form of government. "Ruled by government" is too broad and could apply to various forms of government, while "Europe" is a continent and not a form of government. "Book" is not related to the question at all.
Answer:
monarchy
Question: Manny refused to give the court respect, and was charged with what?
Options: A) dishonor, B) contempt, C) humiliate, D) disdain, E) scorn,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Manny did not show respect to the court, which would be considered disrespectful and disobedient behavior. The term "contempt" specifically refers to actions that show disrespect or disregard for the authority of a court or similar institution. The other options, such as dishonor or humiliate, do not accurately reflect the legal consequences of disrespecting a court.
Answer:
contempt

Options: A) commercial, B) three toed, C) civil service, D) paraguay, E) costa rica,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the man was convicted of a crime related to his lack of motivation or effort, which may imply that he may have been employed in a job that requires him to be active and productive, such as a civil servant. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
civil service

Options: A) legs, B) chair, C) laziness, D) floor, E) sit on,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people were actively trying to make themselves comfortable by sitting down, which implies the use of some type of seating. The option "legs" is incorrect because it is not something that is required for sitting down comfortably. "Laziness" is not relevant to the context of the sentence. "Floor" is incorrect because it is not necessarily comfortable to sit on the floor. "Sit on" is also incorrect because it is not a specific object or item that can provide comfort.
Answer:
chair
Question: The dog loved to run after ball, it would do it over and over until it would what?
Options: A) get tired, B) ball stopped, C) fall and hurt yourself, D) breathe, E) catching,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog has a lot of energy and enjoys chasing after a ball repeatedly. The phrase "over and over" implies that the dog does this for a long period of time, suggesting that eventually, it will become tired. The other options, such as "ball stopped" and "fall and hurt yourself," do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Breathing" is a natural process and doesn't have any clear connection to the dog's activity, while "catching" is already implied in the first part of the sentence (i.e. the dog loves to run after the ball).
Answer:
get tired
Question: Where can a human relax?
Options: A) workplace, B) park, C) church, D) war zone, E) jail,
Knowledge: Parks are commonly associated with relaxation and leisure activities, such as picnics, walks, and spending time in nature. In contrast, workplaces, war zones, and jails are typically associated with stress, danger, and confinement, which are not conducive to relaxation. While churches may promote a sense of peace and calmness, they are primarily intended for religious worship and may not necessarily be a place for relaxation.
Answer:
park
Question: What can large amounts of water do over long periods of time?
Options: A) room temperature, B) thin blood, C) make parks, D) take several forms, E) move mountains,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that large amounts of water can cause significant changes over an extended period of time. Mountains are known to be shaped by the erosive forces of water, which is why the option "move mountains" is the most appropriate choice. The other options, such as "room temperature" or "thin blood," do not fit with the context or the scientific knowledge of the effects of water over time.
Answer:
move mountains

Options: A) get drunk, B) meet new people, C) drinking beer, D) enjoy yourself, E) having sex,
Knowledge: The question implies that going to a party with the opposite sex can have certain consequences, and the choices suggest different possibilities. Out of those options, having sex is most commonly associated with parties where alcohol is consumed and people are in close proximity to each other. While it is possible to meet new people, drink beer, and enjoy oneself at a party, those options do not necessarily lead to the same consequences as going to a party with the opposite sex.
Answer:
having sex
Question: Where would children go to see different animals?
Options: A) school, B) zoo, C) soccer game, D) disneyland, E) cricket stadium,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that children are going somewhere to see different animals. The most common place to see a variety of animals in one location is at a zoo. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. School is where children go to learn, soccer and cricket stadiums are for playing sports, and Disneyland is a theme park focused on entertainment, not animals.
Answer:
zoo

Options: A) boys, B) females, C) feminist, D) lady, E) gods,
Knowledge: The name "Zeus" is commonly associated with Greek mythology, which is populated by a pantheon of gods and goddesses. The sentence suggests that Zeus was a member of this group of deities, as opposed to being a boy, female or lady. The term "feminist" does not apply to mythological figures in this way, and is therefore an unlikely choice for the correct answer.
Answer:
gods
Question: Why would you stop chatting with friends?
Options: A) learning about, B) meeting, C) misunderstanding, D) laughter, E) silliness,
Knowledge: The question asks for a reason to stop chatting with friends, and one of the options is misunderstanding.

Options: A) avoid eye contact, B) feel guilty, C) blush, D) turn purple, E) fall asleep,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John has a negative emotional response to lying. Feeling guilty is a common psychological response to dishonesty, as it goes against moral values and ethics. Avoiding eye contact and blushing may also be associated with lying, but they are not necessarily correlated with the particular emotional response of guilt. Turning purple and falling asleep are not logical or expected outcomes of lying.
Answer:
feel guilty
Question: If competing with others what emotion is useful for getting an advantage?
Options: A) stress, B) anger, C) pumped, D) defeat, E) aggression,
Knowledge: Aggression is typically associated with a competitive mindset and can give an individual an advantage in a competitive situation.

Answer:
aggression

One of their primary duties is to board vessels to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, such as ensuring proper safety equipment is on board, verifying proper documentation and licenses, and checking for illegal activities such as drug trafficking or smuggling.

Options: A) fox theater, B) theater district, C) ballpark, D) theatre, E) counseling,
Knowledge: A well-dressed person visiting a box office suggests that they are going to attend a formal event. The options of "fox theater" or "theatre district" indicate locations that are known for hosting theatrical performances, and therefore are likely a correct answer. The option of "ballpark" would not require formal attire, and "counseling" has no connection to attending a formal event.
Answer:
theatre
Question: What does someone gain from getting divorce?
Options: A) poorer, B) sadness, C) depression, D) tears, E) freedom,
Knowledge: Divorce often represents the end of a relationship that may have been confining or unhappy, so the person who is getting divorced may feel a sense of liberation or freedom. This can manifest in different ways, such as being able to pursue new romantic relationships, travel more, or make other life changes. The other options are negative outcomes that are not usually associated with divorce, or at least not exclusively so.
Answer:

Question: What do you compete against someone in?
Options: A) fair, B) false start, C) competitive, D) in competition, E) practice,
Knowledge: The sentence is asking about what you compete against someone in, which indicates that there is a specific event or activity being referred to. "Fair" and "false start" are not things that you compete against someone in. "Competitive" is an adjective that describes the nature of the activity, rather than the actual event being competed in. "Practice" is a way to prepare for a competition, but it is not the competition itself. Therefore, "in competition" is the most appropriate answer.
Answer:
in competition
Question: How can someone use their thinking to do things a new way?
Options: A) new perspectives, B) knowledge, C) sense, D) best way, E) figure out,
Knowledge: The question suggests that the key to doing things in a new way is to change the way one thinks about the task at hand. This implies that new perspectives are necessary to generate new ideas and approaches. Knowledge and sense might be helpful in some cases, but they don't necessarily lead to new ways of doing things. "Best way" and "figure out" both imply using existing methods or knowledge to solve a problem, which doesn't necessarily lead to innovation or creativity.
Answer:
new perspectives
Question: What is a good way to get food hot?
Options: A) fridge, B) field, C) oven, D) table, E) cupboard,

An oven, on the other hand, is commonly used to heat up food and is a common appliance found in kitchens for this purpose.
Answer:

Options: A) tiredness, B) passing out, C) death, D) exhaustion, E) heartbreak,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that running twenty six miles could have a dangerous consequence for someone with an underlying heart condition. Death is a severe but possible outcome in such a case. Tiredness and exhaustion may be expected outcomes for anyone who runs a marathon, but the sentence specifies an underlying heart condition, which indicates that the risks are higher for this person. Passing out and heartbreak are not relevant to the question's context.
Answer:
death
Question: Where would you get some tin if you do not have any?
Options: A) cupboard, B) hardware store, C) antique store, D) shop, E) grocery store,
Knowledge: Tin is a metal commonly used for making various household items like kitchenware and cans. As such, it is not likely to be found in a cupboard or grocery store. An antique store may have vintage tin items, but it is not a reliable source for acquiring the raw material. The best option for obtaining tin would be a hardware store where metals and tools are sold.
Answer:
hardware store

Options: A) practice, B) compete, C) to have fun, D) get in shape, E) stretch,

Therefore, the most logical reason someone would start playing sports at the gym is to get in shape. This may involve a variety of activities, including strength training, cardio, and sports. The other options - practice, compete, have fun, and stretch - are all possible reasons why someone might play sports at the gym, but they are less directly related to the goal of improving physical fitness.

spare time
Question: The work was pure math.  It couldn't be what to practical applications?
Options: A) contaminated, B) dirty, C) smoothed, D) corrupt, E) applied,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the work is purely theoretical or abstract, and therefore not applicable to practical situations. "Applied" is the opposite of theoretical or abstract, and it means that a theory or concept is used in practical situations. The other options, such as "contaminated" or "corrupt," have negative connotations that do not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
applied
Question: Where do kids in elementary school keep grapes?
Options: A) kitchen, B) wine country, C) fridge, D) lunch box, E) food store,
Knowledge: The sentence refers to "kids in elementary school," suggesting that the context is related to school lunches or snacks. Grapes are a common and healthy snack for kids, often packed in their lunch boxes by parents or caregivers. The other options (kitchen, wine country, fridge, food store) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and would be unlikely places for elementary school kids to keep grapes.

People may attend games to socialize with friends and family, cheer on their favorite team or player, or simply to enjoy the atmosphere and energy of the event.

Answer:
entertainment

Options: A) houseplant, B) bathtub, C) dumpsters, D) urban neighborhood, E) floor,
Knowledge: Cats are known for their instinctive behavior to cover their waste, and they may seek out a similar substrate to their litter box when it is full. Houseplants may be attractive to cats as they offer a similar texture to a litter box, and the soil may absorb urine. The other options such as the bathtub, dumpsters, and the floor do not have a close association with a cat's toileting behavior.
Answer:
houseplant

The options "money," "food and water," and "compliments" do not seem relevant to this context. "Freedom of information" could be a possible answer, but it does not fully capture the person's surprise and shock. "Freedom of expression," however, is a right that allows individuals to express themselves freely, even if it may be controversial or unpopular, and this is likely what the person wanted but felt threatened by the FBI's actions.

Mouth is also not a relevant option as it is not related to the packaging or storage of cereal.
Answer:

A ring is a valuable item that is often targeted by thieves due to its small size and high value, making it a likely choice for what someone might try to steal from a brownstone. The other options - subdivision, live in, new york city, and circlet - do not have any clear connection to theft or brownstones.

The best way to ensure this is by comparing prices of the product at different stores before making a purchase.

Therefore, the most likely option is a bedroom. A cabinet, house, or apartment could all contain a bedroom, but without further context it is impossible to determine if these answers are correct.

The most logical place for a potted plant to wait outside would be in another pot/container, hence the correct answer being "large pot." The other options, such as park or maze, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A tropical forest or a green house could be a possibility, but it is not indicated in the sentence whether the ficus is in one of these locations.

The option "dark place" implies that the creature may be hiding in a location where it is difficult to see, while the other options do not provide any insight into the whereabouts of the creature. The zoo option is unlikely because creatures in a zoo are typically visible to the public, and in a cage or woods, it would still be possible to see the creature even if it is hiding.

Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the horse escaped to a place where it could roam freely, which is commonly associated with the countryside. Horses are often kept in paddocks or stables in urban or suburban areas and may not have access to the open space and freedom they require. The other options are not as likely as countryside to provide the open space the horse needs.
Answer:
countryside
Question: Where is a good place for a woman to store her sunglasses?
Options: A) drugstore, B) movie theater, C) bag, D) shirt pocket, E) purse,
Knowledge: The question implies that a woman wants to keep her sunglasses with her and not lose them. A purse is a commonly used accessory to carry personal items, including sunglasses. The other options (drugstore, movie theater, shirt pocket) are not appropriate places to store sunglasses as they do not offer protection or easy access. A bag could be a viable option but it is not clear what kind of bag is being referred to.
Answer:
purse
Question: What negative thing might someone experience if they spend time learning about a subject that is very complex and difficult?
Options: A) headache, B) gain knowledge, C) elation, D) advance, E) aids,
Knowledge: The question implies that learning about a complex and difficult subject could have a negative impact on someone. It's possible that the person could experience frustration or feel overwhelmed, but the most likely answer is a headache. Learning new information and processing complicated concepts can be mentally exhausting, which could lead to physical discomfort. The other options do not make logical sense as negative side effects of learning about a difficult subject.
Answer:
headache
Question: The aging rockstar had to finally stop playing guitar, his hands just wouldn't cooperate because of the what?
Options: A) singing, B) arthritis, C) listening to music, D) making music, E) playing music,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the aging rockstar had to stop playing guitar due to a physical condition affecting their hands. Arthritis is a common condition that affects joint mobility and could make it difficult for anyone, including a musician, to play an instrument. The other choices do not relate to a physical condition that would affect a musician's ability to play an instrument.
Answer:
arthritis
Question: What is a positive feeling that you might get after going jogging?
Options: A) heart rate increases, B) heart attacks, C) sweating, D) sore feet, E) feel pride,
Knowledge: Jogging is a form of exercise that is generally associated with positive health benefits. It is common to feel a sense of accomplishment and pride after completing a jog, as it is a challenging physical activity that requires discipline and effort. The other options are all negative outcomes that are not typically associated with jogging, such as heart attacks and sore feet.
Answer:
feel pride
Question: What does a performer stand on?
Options: A) dance, B) opera, C) see saw, D) stage, E) party,
Knowledge: A performer typically stands on a stage during a performance, whether it is a play, musical, or dance. The other options, such as see saw and party, do not typically involve a performer standing or performing on something specific. Opera is also performed on a stage, but the question is asking about what a performer stands on, which is more closely associated with theater performances.
Answer:
stage
Question: The car was out in the sun all day, what happened to the interior?
Options: A) set off, B) melted, C) heat up, D) back up, E) red,
Knowledge: When a car is left in the sun for an extended period of time, the interior of the car can become very hot due to the heat. This can cause the temperature to rise and make the interior uncomfortable for passengers to sit in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
heat up
Question: Light, games, and music are part of what celebration?
Options: A) concert, B) found at disco, C) plane, D) carnival, E) christmas,
Knowledge: The words "light," "games," and "music" are often associated with carnivals, which are festive events that usually involve parades, amusement rides, and street performances. Concerts and discos may involve music and light, but they do not typically involve games. Planes are unrelated to celebrations and do not fit the context of the sentence. Christmas may involve lights and music, but it does not typically involve games in the way that carnivals do.
Answer:
carnival
Question: Where is a market likely to be enclosed?
Options: A) field, B) village, C) rural area, D) city, E) mexico,
Knowledge: Enclosed markets are typically found in urban or city areas where there is limited space and a high concentration of people. In contrast, fields and rural areas are more likely to have open-air markets, and villages may have a mix of both. Mexico is a country and therefore is not a likely location for an enclosed market without specifying a city or region.
Answer:
city
Question: He watched the team play every Sunday, but this was the first time the fan would enter a what to see a snap live?
Options: A) football stadium, B) hot room, C) hockey game, D) living room, E) basketball court,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the fan has been watching the team play on Sundays, suggesting that the team likely plays a sport that is typically played on Sundays, such as football. The sentence also mentions the fan seeing a snap "live," which implies that they will be physically present at the game, ruling out options like a living room where they might watch a game on television. Finally, the phrase "enter a" suggests that they will be entering a specific space, further supporting the idea that the answer is a football stadium rather than a general location like a basketball court.
Answer:
football stadium
Question: Where would you not be able to find a radio studio?
Options: A) office building, B) college, C) broadcasting music, D) large city, E) clear area,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where a radio studio would not be found. An office building or college may have a radio studio as part of their communication or media departments. Broadcasting music could refer to a radio station, which would obviously have a radio studio. Large cities are likely to have multiple radio stations, each with their own studio. However, a clear area does not suggest any kind of building or infrastructure, making it the unlikely option where a radio studio could be found.
Answer:
clear area
Question: As the round object rolls down the ramp it will what?
Options: A) sound well, B) fly, C) become broken, D) gain speed, E) fall into hole,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the round object is rolling down a ramp, and the question asks what will happen to it. One common physical phenomenon associated with a rolling object on a slope is that it gains speed as it moves downhill due to gravity. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
gain speed
Question: He would entertain with a pool party regularly, it was the best way to beat the what?
Options: A) please, B) hot, C) guest, D) bribe, E) liked,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the pool party was a way to "beat" something, suggesting that it was a solution to a problem. It then goes on to describe the party as a way to "entertain," implying that it was a social event. Together, these clues suggest that the problem being "beaten" is something related to discomfort or discomfort caused by heat. Therefore, the correct answer is "hot." The other options do not make sense in this context.
Answer:
hot
Question: If I go outside and look down, what will I find outside?
Options: A) ground, B) sun, C) nature, D) sky, E) street,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if the speaker goes outside and looks down, they are likely to see the ground. The other options (sun, sky, nature) are all located higher up in the sky and would not necessarily be visible by looking downwards. The option "street" could potentially be a correct answer if the speaker is standing on a street or sidewalk, but the phrasing of the sentence suggests that they are simply stepping outside and looking down.
Answer:
ground
Question: What happens to your car when you're driving to work?
Options: A) get to work, B) stress, C) use gas, D) speeding ticket, E) get depreciation,
Knowledge: The question is asking about what happens to your car when you're driving to work. Since driving requires fuel to power the engine, the most likely answer is "use gas." The other options don't necessarily relate to the act of driving, but rather the consequences of it (i.e. getting to work, feeling stressed, receiving a speeding ticket, or experiencing depreciation over time).
Answer:
use gas
Question: Regular pants are sometimes not long enough if a person is very what?
Options: A) goofy, B) tall, C) constipated, D) abnormal, E) new,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that regular pants may not fit properly if a person is very something, and one of the choices that fits this context is "tall." Being tall means having a greater height than average, and this could result in pants being too short. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
tall
Question: John cared for Sally, but Sally couldn't return his feelings. She only felt what?
Options: A) unfeeling, B) being mean, C) field, D) disinterest, E) negligence,
Knowledge: The sentence states that Sally cannot return John's feelings, suggesting that she does not have romantic interest in him. "Disinterest" means a lack of interest or enthusiasm, which fits with Sally's feelings towards John. The other options, such as "being mean" or "negligence," do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
Answer:
disinterest
Question: They were very careful transporting the holy artifact, the last thing they wanted to do was deliver it what?
Options: A) profane, B) common, C) halibut, D) broken, E) damaged,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the holy artifact is fragile and requires careful handling. The word "transporting" suggests that the object is being moved from one location to another, further emphasizing the importance of preventing any damage during the journey. The option "halibut" is completely unrelated and can be eliminated. While "profane" and "common" may be opposite in meaning to "holy," neither of them indicates that the object is fragile or requires careful handling. "Broken" is a possibility, but "damaged" is a more general term that covers a wider range of potential harm.
Answer:
damaged
Question: Where is a tin likely to be stored?
Options: A) shopping bag, B) kitchen, C) hardware store, D) grocery store, E) cupboard,
Knowledge: Tin is often used to package and store food items such as canned goods, which are commonly kept in cupboards or cabinets in the kitchen. The other options do not make sense for storing tin as they are not typically associated with food storage or packaging.
Answer:
cupboard
Question: They were worried about the fruit staying fresh in the heat, so they put it in the what?
Options: A) san francisco, B) refrigerator, C) gay bar, D) container, E) plate,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that there is a concern about the fruit staying fresh in the heat. The most logical solution for this problem would be to put the fruit in a place where it can remain cool and preserved, such as a refrigerator. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
refrigerator
Question: On what would you serve an egg to someone?
Options: A) chicken coop, B) henhouse, C) plate, D) glass cup, E) bird's nest,
Knowledge: It is customary to serve eggs on a plate for human consumption. The other options, such as a chicken coop or bird's nest, are not realistic choices for serving eggs to people. While a henhouse is where chickens live, it is not where one would serve food to someone. A glass cup is not a suitable dish for serving eggs, unless perhaps they are going to be used in a mixed drink or cocktail.
Answer:
plate
Question: Where can you get a french horn to take home with you?
Options: A) concert, B) music class, C) concert hall, D) france, E) music store,
Knowledge: The question is asking where you can acquire a French horn to take home, which suggests that the answer must relate to purchasing or borrowing the instrument. Of the options given, the only one that could reasonably involve buying or renting a French horn is a music store. The other options all relate to attending events or classes, which is not necessarily related to acquiring an instrument. Also, the option 'France' is misleading because it states the name of the country as an option, whereas the correct answer would be a store in France.
Answer:
music store
Question: The roommates were young and irresponsible, it was always a mess at their what?
Options: A) apartment, B) table, C) office, D) desk, E) closet,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the roommates are young and irresponsible, which suggests that they may not have good cleaning habits or keep a tidy living space. An apartment is a common living space for roommates, and the other options such as table, office, desk, and closet do not have the same connotation of being a shared residential space that is prone to becoming messy.
Answer:
apartment
Question: What do criminals do when they are caught?
Options: A) they feel happy, B) realise error of ways, C) take money, D) serving time, E) arm themselves,
Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of being caught as a criminal. "Serving time" refers to the punishment of being sentenced to a certain amount of time in jail or prison. The other options do not make sense in this context - a criminal would not feel happy about being caught or take money (which would be considered theft) and arming themselves would only lead to further trouble with the law. "Realising error of ways" is a possible answer, but it is not a specific consequence that is always associated with being caught as a criminal.
Answer:
serving time
Question: What is likely to be a long term negative consequence of of over eating hamburger?
Options: A) gaining weight, B) stomach ache, C) get full, D) losing weight, E) death,
Knowledge: Overeating generally leads to an increase in calorie intake, which can cause a person to gain weight over time. Hamburger, being a high-calorie food, when overeaten, can cause a significant weight gain. A stomach ache is a more immediate consequence that may occur after eating a lot of hamburger, but it is not necessarily a long-term consequence. Getting full is a normal response to eating and is not negative. Losing weight is the opposite of the expected consequence of overeating hamburger. Death is an extreme consequence that is not relevant to the context of the question.
Answer:
gaining weight
Question: Why might someone decide to having a checkup for followup?
Options: A) uncertainty, B) anxiety, C) stress, D) anxious, E) pain,
Knowledge: The word "checkup for followup" suggests that this is a medical appointment that is occurring after something else, likely a previous checkup or medical event. The word "uncertainty" suggests that there is still some question or concern that needs to be addressed, which is why the person is having a follow-up checkup. The other options do not necessarily indicate a reason for a checkup for follow-up, as they could apply to a range of different medical situations.
Answer:
uncertainty
Question: What can a vehicle do to groceries?
Options: A) eat, B) feel impact of accident, C) slow down, D) carry, E) travel,
Knowledge: The context of the question is related to groceries, which implies that the vehicle would be used to transport them. The word "carry" is the closest in meaning to transporting or moving something from one place to another, which would be the primary function of a vehicle in this context. The other options do not make sense in relation to groceries, as they either involve physical actions that cannot be performed by a vehicle (eating), or negative outcomes that would not be desirable (feeling the impact of an accident, slowing down).
Answer:
carry
Question: A small dog lived with a a woman who loved him. Where might he have lived?
Options: A) person's house, B) dog house, C) canada, D) illinois, E) basket,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog lived with a woman, which indicates that the dog was a pet and likely lived in the woman's house rather than a dog house. The option "basket" may seem like a possible answer, but it is unlikely that a dog would live permanently in a basket. Canada and Illinois are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
person's house
Question: What area would you find a large number of wheat fields?
Options: A) countryside, B) mill, C) bread, D) eat cake, E) farmer's field,
Knowledge: Wheat fields are commonly found in rural or agricultural areas, and the term "countryside" specifically refers to areas outside of cities and towns that are characterized by open fields and natural landscapes. "Mill" and "bread" are related to wheat, but do not necessarily indicate an area in which wheat fields are concentrated. "Eat cake" is unrelated and "farmer's field" is too general to infer a specific crop or location.
Answer:
countryside
Question: Where are you likely to find well stocked aisles?
Options: A) supermarket, B) church, C) car wash, D) sanctuary, E) building,
Knowledge: A well-stocked aisle is most commonly associated with a store or supermarket that sells goods. The other options, such as a church, car wash or sanctuary, do not have aisles that would typically be referred to as "well-stocked". A building is a general term that could refer to any type of structure and does not provide enough context to determine where well-stocked aisles might be found.
Answer:
supermarket
Question: Where can butter be found in small pats?
Options: A) refrigerator, B) restaurant, C) inside a mammoth's handbag, D) pastry, E) fridge,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that small pats of butter are commonly found in a specific location, suggesting that it is a common item in that context. While butter can certainly be found in refrigerators, pastry, and fridges, these options do not specify the size or form of the butter, making them less likely to be the correct answer. The inclusion of "inside a mammoth's handbag" is clearly a joke and can be eliminated as an option. The most appropriate answer is thus "restaurant," where small pats of butter are often provided with bread or other dishes.
Answer:
restaurant
Question: Wanting to listen to the radio, what did the man do to it?
Options: A) play music, B) turn on, C) train, D) blaring, E) radiotracking,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man wanted to listen to the radio, which suggests that it was initially turned off. Therefore, the correct answer is "turn on." The other options (play music, train, blaring, radiotracking) do not accurately describe what the man did to the radio to be able to listen to it.
Answer:
turn on
Question: He is beginning work at his first job.  What is he feeling?
Options: A) panic, B) resting, C) stress, D) excitement, E) working,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that this is the person's first job, which suggests that they may be experiencing feelings of excitement and anticipation. Starting a new job can be a significant and positive milestone in someone's life, so it's more likely that he is excited rather than feeling panic, stress, or simply resting. The option "working" is not a feeling, but rather an action that will come after starting the job.
Answer:
excitement
Question: Why do children usually like jumping rope?
Options: A) increased heart rate, B) smiling, C) sweating, D) having fun, E) jumping,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a reason why children enjoy jumping rope, which is unlikely to be related to physiological processes such as an increased heart rate or sweating. While those physical effects may be caused by jumping rope, they are not likely to be the primary motivator for why children enjoy the activity. "Smiling" is a possible answer, but it is not specific enough to explain why children enjoy jumping rope. Therefore, "having fun" is the best answer because it directly relates to the enjoyment that children experience from this activity.
Answer:
having fun
Question: What do I look forward to when opening a business?
Options: A) stress, B) success, C) failure, D) bankruptcy, E) cash,
Knowledge: The word "look forward to" suggests a positive outcome, and the context of opening a business implies that the goal is to be successful. Opening a business is often associated with hopes and aspirations for success, rather than stress, failure, or bankruptcy. "Cash" could be a factor in success, but it is not the ultimate goal.
Answer:
success
Question: Where can someone get a flute?
Options: A) orchestra, B) steal it, C) marching band, D) symphony, E) musical instrument store,
Knowledge: The other options, such as stealing a flute or finding one in a marching band, are not ethical or practical ways to obtain a flute. Orchestras and symphonies may have flutes, but they are typically reserved for members of the ensemble. A musical instrument store, on the other hand, is a place where one can buy or rent a variety of musical instruments, including flutes. Therefore, the correct answer is musical instrument store.
Answer:
musical instrument store
Question: Why do people go about killing people ?
Options: A) murder, B) get killed, C) sporting event, D) hate, E) feel remorse,
Knowledge: The word "killing" suggests intentional and unjustified taking of a human life, which is categorized as murder. The reason why people commit this crime varies from person to person, but one common motivation for murder is hate or anger towards the victim. The other options, such as sporting events or feeling remorse, do not align with the severity and intentionality of murder.
Answer:
hate
Question: For what reason did he commit the killing?
Options: A) investigation, B) disease, C) punishment, D) retribution, E) going to jail,
Knowledge: The word "retribution" refers to punishment inflicted on someone as vengeance for a wrong or criminal act. In this context, it suggests that the person committed the killing as a form of revenge or retaliation for something that was done to them, making it the most likely answer. "Investigation," "disease," and "going to jail" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, while "punishment" is a possibility but not as specific as "retribution."
Answer:
retribution
Question: Bobby sat on the examination table.  Happy that this was a simple procedure, and he could do it here instead of staying overnight some place else.  Where might he be?
Options: A) hospital, B) school, C) obituary, D) doctor's office, E) vets office,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions an examination table, which is typically found in a medical setting. The fact that Bobby is happy this is a simple procedure and that he doesn't have to stay overnight suggests that it's a routine medical check-up or appointment, rather than an emergency or serious illness. The hospital and vet's office options might be plausible, but the language of the sentence suggests a human patient rather than an animal. The school and obituary options have no connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
doctor's office
Question: Brian was a soldier.  he just got word that he was called back to active service.  He'd have to do what soon?
Options: A) report for duty, B) wait for orders, C) fight for freedom, D) obay, E) receive orders,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Brian was a soldier and has received the news that he was called back to active service, meaning he would have to report for duty soon. The other options may be related to being a soldier, but they do not accurately reflect the immediate action that Brian would need to take upon being called back to active service.
Answer:
report for duty
Question: Where would you put things in a paper bag?
Options: A) synagogue, B) classroom, C) grocery store, D) lunchbox, E) front porch,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the question is related to shopping or carrying items in a bag. A grocery store is a common place to use a paper bag for carrying purchases, while a synagogue, classroom, lunchbox, and front porch are not typically associated with this activity.
Answer:
grocery store
Question: Where would you put some coffee if you are thirsty?
Options: A) container, B) internet cafe, C) starbucks, D) cup, E) supermarket,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is thirsty and wants to drink some coffee. To consume a liquid, most people would use a cup, which is a vessel designed to hold liquids. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
cup
Question: I went to a party at my friend's house in New York and everyone there shared a meal in what eating place?
Options: A) mall counter, B) big city, C) shopping area, D) restaurant, E) dining room,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker went to a party at a friend's house, which implies a more casual setting than a restaurant or mall counter. Additionally, sharing a meal typically takes place in a designated eating area, such as a dining room, rather than a shopping area or big city.
Answer:
dining room
Question: James loved going down.  He thought that the worst part of climbing was what?
Options: A) loss of oxygen, B) blisters, C) ascending, D) vertigo, E) getting a snack,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James enjoys going down, which implies that he doesn't enjoy going up. This eliminates options such as loss of oxygen, blisters, and vertigo, which are all physical ailments that can occur during climbing regardless of which direction one is going. Getting a snack is also unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be ascending, which is the direct opposite of going down.
Answer:
ascending
Question: Where would explosive devices be used to build and demolish things?
Options: A) bomb, B) army, C) war, D) workplace, E) construction site,
Knowledge: Explosive devices are commonly used in construction sites for building and demolishing structures. They are particularly useful in cases where traditional demolition methods may not be practical due to safety or space constraints. While bombs and explosives are also associated with the military and war, the context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on their use in a non-violent setting. The options "army" and "war" are therefore less likely to be correct. "Workplace" could be a possible answer, but it is more general and does not specifically relate to the use of explosive devices.
Answer:
construction site
Question: A child needs caregivers.  Who are the most common caregivers for a child?
Options: A) become adult, B) adult, C) swing set, D) parent, E) father,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that a child requires the presence of someone to take care of them, suggesting that the answer is a person or group of people. The most common caregivers for a child are typically their parents, as they are responsible for nurturing and supporting their child's growth and development. The other options are either not relevant to the context of the sentence or do not describe a caregiver role.
Answer:
parent
Question: Where do you bring a small dog if it needs to relieve itself?
Options: A) europe, B) front porch, C) heat, D) basket, E) outside,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a small dog needs to relieve itself, which would typically require going outside. Dogs are commonly trained to do their business outside, either in a backyard or on a walk. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
outside
Question: Driving is the most popular form of personal what?
Options: A) transportation, B) traffic jams, C) moving, D) status, E) traffic accident,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that driving is a common way for people to move from one place to another, which is a characteristic commonly associated with transportation. Traffic jams and accidents may be negative aspects of driving, but they do not describe the purpose or function of driving. Moving may involve a variety of methods, such as walking, using public transportation, or hiring a moving company, so it does not accurately reflect the popularity of driving as a personal mode of transportation. Status may be a reason why some people choose to drive, but it is not the most widely recognized aspect of personal transportation.
Answer:
transportation
Question: The woman let her son play with it in his room.  She did not do what?
Options: A) forbid, B) annoy, C) prohibit, D) stop, E) disallow,
Knowledge: The use of the word "let" indicates that the woman allowed her son to play with something in his room, so options like prohibit and disallow can be eliminated as they suggest the opposite action of not allowing something. Annoy is a possibility, but it doesn't fit as well with the context of the sentence. Stop is also a possibility, but it doesn't convey the sense of disallowing something that forbid does. Therefore, forbid is the best choice.
Answer:
forbid
Question: Where is likely the coziest plat to eat?
Options: A) downtown, B) prison, C) city, D) own house, E) earing,
Knowledge: The word "cozy" suggests a comfortable, warm, and intimate environment, which is typically associated with one's own house. Eating in one's own house can provide a sense of familiarity and relaxation that may not be found in a public space like downtown, prison, or city. The inclusion of "earing" is likely a typo and does not make sense in the sentence.
Answer:
own house
Question: Where is a bunch of grapes likely to be carried in?
Options: A) fruit cocktail, B) wine press, C) a box, D) picnic basket, E) kitchen,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to carrying a bunch of grapes. Picnic baskets are often associated with carrying food and drinks for outdoor activities, making it the most likely option. A wine press is used for making wine and a box is too general without any specific details about what the grapes are for. The fruit cocktail and kitchen options are also not related to carrying a bunch of grapes.
Answer:
picnic basket
Question: The monger removed the bone, what was he looking to serve?
Options: A) octopus, B) fresh fish, C) skeleton, D) human body, E) dog's mouth,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the monger removed a bone in preparation for serving something. Out of the given choices, only fresh fish is a common food that would require the removal of bones. Octopus is typically served whole or in large pieces, and would not require bone removal. Skeleton, human body, and dog's mouth are all inappropriate choices for food.
Answer:
fresh fish
Question: James was cooling off in the pool on a hot summer day.  Why might have he been doing that?
Options: A) sweating, B) relaxation, C) revenge, D) shivering, E) loss of heat,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was trying to cool off on a hot summer day, which is often done for the purpose of relaxation. Swimming or sitting in a pool can help to reduce body temperature and provide a break from the heat, which may explain why James was doing it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
relaxation
Question: Where would you enjoy a beer while throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects?
Options: A) bowling alley, B) hockey game, C) sporting event, D) croquet, E) fridge,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions "throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects," which is a clear reference to the sport of bowling. Bowling alleys are specifically designed for this sport, and they often have bars or restaurants where patrons can enjoy a beer while playing. The other options, such as a hockey game or croquet, do not involve throwing heavy spheres or white objects, and the option of a fridge does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
bowling alley
Question: Where would you get a baseball if you do not have one?
Options: A) sporting goods store, B) america, C) park, D) sandbox, E) break window,
Knowledge: A sporting goods store is a typical place to purchase a baseball. The other options, such as America, a park, a sandbox, or breaking a window, do not make sense in this context as they do not relate to how to acquire a baseball.
Answer:
sporting goods store
Question: The barn was torn to shreds and all the pieces of board became one projectile after another flying through the air, it was a powerful what?
Options: A) tornado, B) weapon, C) baseball, D) air, E) canon,
Knowledge: The phrase "torn to shreds" refers to a destructive force that has the ability to break down a large object into many small pieces. Additionally, the phrase "one projectile after another flying through the air" suggests a swirling motion that is typical of a tornado. A tornado is a powerful and destructive weather phenomenon that can easily tear through buildings and cause debris to fly through the air. The other options, such as "weapon," "baseball," "air," and "cannon," do not fit the context and would not be able to explain the destructive force described in the sentence.
Answer:
tornado
Question: The person was bored by the remedial math class, what did he want out of the class?
Options: A) look beautiful, B) swimming lessons, C) intellectual stimulation, D) own house, E) time to rest,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person found the math class to be uninteresting, which suggests that they were seeking something else from the class besides a basic level of understanding. The option "intellectual stimulation" is directly related to the sentence, as it suggests that the person wanted to be intellectually engaged by the class. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.

Question: Sally needed a break from her hard work.  She took a vacation, and decided to do what to a sand castle?
Options: A) faster, B) piece together, C) construct, D) put together, E) working,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally took a break from hard work by going on vacation and doing an activity that involves building. Sand castles are typically constructed and built, which makes "construct" the most appropriate option. "Faster" and "working" do not make sense in the context of building a sand castle, while "piece together" and "put together" imply that the castle was already in some state of completion before Sally began her activity, which is not indicated in the sentence.
Answer:
construct
Question: Mary never allowed her animal friend to do what without a leash?
Options: A) leave home, B) vomit, C) eating, D) hunt for food, E) fight for life,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mary's animal friend needs to be on a leash when doing a certain activity. The only choice that fits this context is "leave home," as animals on leashes are often taken outside of the house for walks or other outings. The other options are not related to the concept of leash-walking.
Answer:
leave home
Question: What is a good place for a grumpy cat?
Options: A) sand box, B) back yard, C) ground, D) warm bed, E) shelf,
Knowledge: The word "grumpy" suggests that this cat would prefer a comfortable, cozy spot to curl up and be left alone. A warm bed is a common place for cats to nap, and the word "warm" implies that it is a comfortable spot. The other options, such as a sandbox or a shelf, do not suggest a comfortable or cozy environment for a grumpy cat.
Answer:
warm bed
Question: Where does blood travel in a person?
Options: A) hospital, B) soccer game, C) capillaries, D) tubes, E) animals,
Knowledge: Blood travels throughout the body via a network of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries.

The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.
Answer:
capillaries

Options: A) classroom, B) to park, C) apartment, D) school, E) demonstration,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Simon brought his computer to his living space, as he mentioned going up the stairs and setting it up by the sofa. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, such as a classroom, park, school, or demonstration.
Answer:
apartment
Question: What could someone get into if he or she is becoming inebriated?
Options: A) fights, B) addiction, C) arrest, D) staggering, E) paralysis,
Knowledge: Becoming inebriated often refers to becoming drunk, which can impair judgment, coordination, and impulse control. This can lead to aggressive, harmful, or reckless behavior, such as getting into fights. Addiction, arrest, and paralysis are less common outcomes of becoming inebriated. Staggering may occur as a physical symptom of intoxication, but it is not a consequence that someone would "get into."
Answer:
fights
Question: They had room for many bedrooms, an office, a study, even a playroom; They certain had a what?
Options: A) building, B) nursery school, C) preschool, D) big house, E) small house,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the space being described has room for multiple bedrooms, an office, a study, and a playroom. This suggests that it is a large and spacious living area, as a small house would not have enough room for all of these separate areas. Building is too vague, and nursery school and preschool are not consistent with the context provided.
Answer:
big house
Question: What could have a hot handle?
Options: A) carrying things, B) coffee cup, C) iron, D) frying pan, E) briefcase,
Knowledge: Frying pans are often used in cooking and can become very hot, which is why they typically have a handle to make them easier to hold and maneuver while cooking. The other options, such as carrying things, a coffee cup, an iron, or a briefcase, do not typically have hot handles.
Answer:
frying pan
Question: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits?
Options: A) new car, B) promotion, C) boredom, D) impatience, E) pressure,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is thinking about the pros and cons of extra responsibilities and benefits that come with a certain achievement or change in their career. Given the context, the most likely choice is promotion. Driving to work suggests that the person is employed and looking to advance in their career. The other choices don't make sense in this context.
Answer:
promotion
Question: Attempting to light a wet match is likely to result in what?
Options: A) make fire, B) rain, C) combustion, D) illumination, E) frustration,
Knowledge: The phrase "wet match" suggests that the match is damp or moist, which means that it will not light easily. This is because the moisture can prevent the match from igniting, and can also put out the flame if the match does light. Therefore, attempting to light a wet match is more likely to result in frustration rather than any of the other options suggested.
Answer:
frustration
Question: What is the worst thing that someone can do while driving?
Options: A) getting somewhere, B) use gas, C) doze off, D) listening others, E) speeding ticket,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is one specific action that is considered the "worst thing" to do while driving. From a safety perspective, dozing off or falling asleep while driving is extremely dangerous and can result in serious accidents. The other options such as "getting somewhere" or "using gas" are not inherently dangerous while driving, while "listening to others" is not specific enough to the context and "speeding ticket" refers to a consequence of bad driving, rather than the action itself.
Answer:
doze off
Question: Where is the best place to put shoes?
Options: A) closet, B) table, C) box, D) bed, E) park,
Knowledge: The question is asking about the best place to store shoes, which suggests that the answer should be a location where shoes can be organized and kept out of the way when not in use. A closet is a common location for storing shoes as it allows for easy organization and access, while keeping them hidden away from the rest of the living space. The other options do not provide an adequate solution for shoe storage.
Answer:
closet
Question: James's hammer bent while he was driving nails. He needed a new one.  Where might he go to find one?
Options: A) repair shop, B) carpenter's toolbox, C) tool box, D) hardware store, E) tool shop,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James needs a new hammer, which is a common tool found in hardware stores. Hardware stores typically carry a wide range of tools, including hammers, and are a common place to buy tools for household or DIY projects. While a repair shop or tool shop could potentially have hammers, they are not as commonly associated with selling these types of tools. A carpenter's toolbox or personal tool box may not have a new hammer readily available, as these are typically stored with the owner's personal tools.
Answer:
hardware store
Question: What happens when you get a blackout from amnesia?
Options: A) amnesia, B) drunkenness, C) hangover, D) enjoy, E) burn,
Knowledge: The question is asking about the result of getting a blackout from amnesia, which suggests a loss of memory. Amnesia is a condition where a person experiences memory loss, which could result in a blackout. The other options do not relate to the concept of memory loss, making them incorrect choices.
Answer:
amnesia
Question: A woodworker is missing a screw, where should he look for it?
Options: A) tool box, B) wall outlet fixture, C) on the ground, D) motorcycle, E) computer,
Knowledge: A screw is a small, metal fastener commonly used in woodworking. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the missing screw would be found in a place where woodworking tools and materials are stored. The tool box is a common storage location for screws, while the other options have no connection to woodworking or screws.
Answer:
tool box
Question: Her dream was to own a house on the countryside, but instead she lived in a cramped apartment in the what?
Options: A) street, B) ghetto, C) residential area, D) subdivision, E) city,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman did not fulfill her dream of owning a house in the countryside and instead settled for a cramped apartment. The word "city" provides a clear contrast to the dream of living in the countryside, while the other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well. "Street" and "residential area" could refer to a variety of locations, while "ghetto" and "subdivision" have negative and positive connotations respectively, which are not implied in the sentence.
Answer:
city
Question: In a predicament an animal might choose flight or what?
Options: A) leave home, B) hunt for food, C) smell prey, D) feel pain, E) fight for life,
Knowledge: The word "predicament" suggests a difficult or challenging situation, in which an animal might need to protect itself. The option "fight for life" is the most appropriate response, as it implies that the animal is facing a life-threatening situation and might need to use aggression to protect itself. The other options do not necessarily relate to survival in a dangerous circumstance.
Answer:
fight for life
Question: What container does peanut butter come in?
Options: A) cupboard, B) pantry, C) jar, D) bottle, E) supermarket,
Knowledge: Peanut butter is commonly sold in jars, which are typically made of glass or plastic and have a screw-on lid for easy opening and closing. The other options, such as cupboard and pantry, are places where you might store peanut butter once it's been opened and transferred to a different container. A bottle would be an unusual choice for peanut butter packaging, and supermarkets are places where you can buy peanut butter, but they are not the specific container that it comes in.
Answer:
jar
Question: The war was followed by a tentative peace.  People didn't think it would last because despite a desire to move forward, there rebuilding was difficult and there was a lot of what?
Options: A) love and understanding, B) fighting, C) hostility, D) destruction, E) turmoil,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite a desire for peace, there were difficulties in rebuilding and a sense of instability or upheaval. Turmoil means a state of great disturbance, confusion or uncertainty, and is a suitable word to describe the situation described in the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the sense of unrest and uncertainty conveyed by the context of the sentence.
Answer:
turmoil
Question: What could cats do if they were taller?
Options: A) annoy, B) eat meat, C) open doors, D) need food, E) jog,
Knowledge: The question asks about what cats could do if they were taller. Cats, being intelligent creatures, might be able to do certain things if they were tall enough to reach or grasp objects that they cannot currently reach, such as opening doors. The other choices - annoy, eat meat, need food, and jog - either do not have any clear connection to the context of the question or have no direct relation to a cat's ability to be taller.
Answer:
open doors
Question: The snake was worried about predators overhead, where did it go for cover?
Options: A) wooded area, B) tropical forest, C) warm place, D) canyon, E) sleeping bag,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the snake was seeking cover from predators that may be above ground, which suggests that it was seeking shelter under some sort of overhead cover. A wooded area would provide ample opportunity for the snake to seek shelter under branches and leaves. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence, as a tropical forest or warm place may not provide enough overhead cover and a canyon or sleeping bag do not seem like feasible options for a snake seeking cover.
Answer:
wooded area
Question: Where can you take home a hermit crab?
Options: A) pet shop, B) fishmongers, C) intertidal zone, D) tidepools, E) ocean,
Knowledge: Hermit crabs are commonly sold as pets in pet shops, making this the most likely answer. Fishmongers sell fish, not hermit crabs, and the intertidal zone and tidepools are natural habitats where hermit crabs might be found but not taken home. The ocean is too vast to pinpoint a specific location to take home a hermit crab.
Answer:
pet shop
Question: Why is someone getting drunk likely to sleep with someone they usually wouldn't approve of?
Options: A) tired, B) violence, C) falling down, D) lower standards, E) vomiting,
Knowledge: Alcohol consumption can impair judgment and decision-making abilities, leading individuals to make choices they may not make if they were sober. This can include choosing to engage in sexual activity with someone they may not typically find attractive or approve of. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for this behavior, and may not be related to alcohol consumption.
Answer:
lower standards
Question: Where should meat to be used soon be?
Options: A) freezer, B) fridge, C) butcher shop, D) counter, E) frying pan,
Knowledge: The question suggests that the meat is not going to be used immediately and needs to be stored properly to prevent spoilage. Freezing is an option for long-term storage, but the question specifies that it needs to be used soon, so the freezer is not the best answer. Butcher shop and frying pan are not options for storing meat. The counter is not a good choice either, as it can lead to bacterial growth if the meat is left at room temperature for too long. The fridge is the most appropriate answer for storing meat that needs to be used soon, as it will slow down bacterial growth and keep the meat fresh for a few more days.
Answer:
fridge
Question: Where does someone get a rubber for sex?
Options: A) drug store, B) wallet, C) bedside table, D) house, E) classroom,
Knowledge: The word "rubber" in this context refers to a condom, which is a form of contraception used during sexual activity. Condoms are typically sold in drug stores, as well as other places like supermarkets, convenience stores, and health clinics. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
Answer:
drug store
Question: James tripped while running in the house.   His mother had repeatedly warned him to put his toys away but he did not listen. Where might his toys have been?
Options: A) slippery, B) floor, C) store, D) drawer, E) basement,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James tripped over something in the house, which implies that the toys were on the floor where he was running. Additionally, his mother had warned him to put his toys away, indicating that they were likely scattered on the floor rather than neatly stored in a drawer or a basement. The options "slippery" and "store" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
floor
Question: Large fluffy clouds do what to people who watch them?
Options: A) blanket, B) cause rain to fall, C) awe inspiring, D) rain water, E) bring rain,
Knowledge: The phrase "large fluffy clouds" suggests that the clouds have a visually pleasing and impressive appearance which can often evoke feelings of wonder or amazement in people who observe them. The option "blanket" does not make sense in the context of the sentence, "cause rain to fall" and "bring rain" suggests that the clouds are responsible for precipitation which is not mentioned in the sentence, and "rain water" is not a suggested effect of observing the clouds.
Answer:
awe inspiring
Question: She had to run errands that day, she did it right away because she prefers to what?
Options: A) complete tasks, B) gain, C) make tea, D) helpful, E) get things done,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the woman completed her errands right away, suggesting that she has a preference for efficiency and productivity. The phrase "get things done" directly relates to this idea of being productive and completing tasks. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
get things done
Question: The person forgot to put a lid on the garbage, raccoons knocked all of it out of the what?
Options: A) container, B) composted, C) nice aroma, D) smell terrible, E) smells bad,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person forgot to put a lid on a container, likely a garbage can, and that raccoons were able to knock all of the garbage out. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence. "Composted" implies that the garbage was being turned into compost, which is not mentioned. "Nice aroma" suggests the garbage smelled good, which is not the case in the sentence. "Smell terrible" and "smells bad" describe the smell of the garbage, but do not indicate what the raccoons knocked it out of.
Answer:
container
Question: Sometimes when animals meet, what happens?
Options: A) fight each other, B) procreate, C) sleep, D) live lives, E) listen to each other,
Knowledge: The word "meet" suggests that the animals are encountering each other for the first time, and given the range of options, it is likely that there will be some sort of interaction or reaction. "Procreate" would only occur if the animals were of the opposite sex and willing to mate. "Sleep" and "live lives" are too general and could happen regardless of whether animals meet or not. "Listen to each other" might occur in some cases, but it is less likely than animals fighting each other to establish dominance.
Answer:
fight each other
Question: A judge was on his bench serving justice, what was his most important principle?
Options: A) honest, B) lawyre, C) fair, D) arranging files, E) tell truth,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the judge was doing his job on his bench, and the most important principle related to his job would be the idea of being fair. Being fair is a foundational principle of serving justice, thus marking it as the most important principle. The other options - honest, lawyer, arranging files, and telling the truth - do not relate directly to the idea of serving justice, and hence do not qualify as the answer.
Answer:
fair
Question: Where can you find a story in print?
Options: A) bookstore, B) school, C) newspaper, D) past, E) book or magazine,
Knowledge: A story in print can refer to a work of fiction or non-fiction that is published in a physical format such as a book or a magazine. Bookstores are a common place to find books, while schools may have textbooks or novels for students to read. Newspapers typically contain news articles and not fiction or longer-form stories. The option "past" does not make sense in this context as it is not a physical location or item where stories can be found.
Answer:
book or magazine
Question: Why would someone want to be eating?
Options: A) satisfaction, B) dyspepsia, C) indigestion, D) to gloat, E) gaining weight,
Knowledge: Eating is usually done to satisfy hunger and provide the body with necessary nutrients to maintain health. The other options, such as dyspepsia and indigestion, are negative outcomes from overeating or eating unhealthy foods. To gloat does not relate to the act of eating, and gaining weight may be a consequence of frequent overeating but is not a reason someone would want to eat.
Answer:
satisfaction
Question: Where would you go to learn how to play a french horn?
Options: A) music store, B) concert hall, C) music class, D) france, E) on top of a mountain,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the learner is looking for a formal setting to learn how to play a french horn. While one could potentially find resources and guidance in other settings, such as a music store or concert hall, a music class is a dedicated space for learning and instruction. France may be associated with the instrument due to its name, but it is not a relevant answer for where to learn how to play it. On top of a mountain is clearly an absurd choice and can be eliminated.
Answer:
music class
Question: Joe crossed the half court boundary and focused on 3 pointers.  What game is his playing?
Options: A) society, B) sporting event, C) football, D) atlas or map, E) basketball,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions the half court boundary and 3 pointers, which are specific to the game of basketball. The other options have no relation to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
basketball
Question: Other than water, sugar is the main ingredient in what?
Options: A) candy bar, B) soda pop, C) coffee, D) tea, E) cupboard,
Knowledge: The sentence states that sugar is a main ingredient, which implies that it is being used as a sweetener in a food or beverage. Candy bars and tea often contain sugar, but water is not a typical ingredient in either. Coffee may be sweetened with sugar, but it is not a main ingredient. Cupboard is not a food or beverage, so it can be eliminated as an option. Therefore, soda pop, which is known to contain high amounts of sugar, is the most likely answer.
Answer:
soda pop
Question: It was a nice day out, good weather to fire up the grill out in the what?
Options: A) restaurant, B) kitchen, C) park, D) back yard, E) backyard,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is talking about a place where they can fire up a grill, which is typically done outdoors. The options "restaurant" and "kitchen" do not make sense in this context, as those are indoor spaces where grilling would not typically occur. "Park" could be a possible option, but the use of the word "out" suggests that the speaker is already outside, so they would not need to go to a park to grill. Therefore, the best answer would be "backyard," which is a common outdoor space for grilling.
Answer:
backyard
Question: Steve needed a place to sleep so he asked around and found a place to stay.  Where might he be staying?
Options: A) apartment, B) friend's house, C) tent, D) outside, E) living room,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Steve asked people for a place to stay, which implies that he is likely staying with someone he knows. The options "apartment" and "tent" do not fit the context of the sentence because they imply that Steve found a place to stay on his own. The option "outside" is unlikely because it suggests Steve would be sleeping outdoors, which is not a common or safe option. The option "living room" is a possibility, but the most likely answer is "friend's house" since it is common for people to offer a spare room or couch to a friend in need.
Answer:
friend's house
Question: The man reduced the town to rubble out of hate, what was his goal?
Options: A) wage war, B) play nice, C) fight enemy, D) stab to death, E) destroy enemy,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's goal was to completely destroy the town, which is often a tactic used in war to weaken the enemy. In this context, "reducing to rubble" means destroying completely. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not align with the man's actions of hate and destruction.
Answer:
destroy enemy
Question: What does a child learn to do in a lake?
Options: A) become adult, B) row boat, C) drive, D) go out to play, E) begin school,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a child is learning a specific skill related to a lake. The option "row boat" is the most specific skill related to being on a lake, as it involves using oars to move a small boat through the water. The other options, such as becoming an adult, starting school, or driving, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Go out to play" is a more general option that could fit, but it is not as specific as "row boat."
Answer:
row boat
Question: Where do you keep a chess board?
Options: A) house, B) basement, C) toy store, D) cabinet, E) retirement community,
Knowledge: Chess boards are typically kept in a cabinet when not in use to protect the pieces and keep them organized. Keeping a chess board in a house is too general and does not specify where in the house it would be kept. Likewise, keeping it in a basement or retirement community is not specific enough or applicable to all situations. Keeping it in a toy store does not make sense as it is not a place where one would typically keep personal items.
Answer:
cabinet
Question: They were going to play at the theater, part way through there was a what?
Options: A) spending money, B) intermission, C) being entertained, D) sleepiness, E) man of la mancha,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the event being described involves a performance at a theater, likely a play or musical. The phrase "part way through" suggests that the performance was interrupted temporarily. An intermission is a common pause in live performances that allows the audience to take a break, use the restroom, and purchase refreshments. "Spending money" and "being entertained" are too vague and do not relate directly to the context of the sentence. "Sleepiness" is unrelated and "man of la mancha" is a specific reference that does not fit the sentence.
Answer:
intermission
Question: Where would you carry a small folding knife?
Options: A) kitchen drawer, B) fishing boat, C) pocket, D) garbage bag, E) table,
Knowledge: A small folding knife is often carried in a pocket for convenience and easy access. The other options do not make sense in the context of carrying a knife, as they are not locations where a knife would typically be stored or used. A kitchen drawer might contain a larger knife used for cooking, a fishing boat might have specialized knives for cleaning fish, and a garbage bag and table are not relevant to the question.
Answer:
pocket
Question: Where would you go if you want to get a newspaper with a specific title?
Options: A) library, B) magazine article, C) archives, D) safe deposit box, E) page,
Knowledge: A library is a common place to find newspapers, especially if you are looking for a specific title. Many libraries keep archives of newspapers on microfilm or in digital format, and they may also have physical copies available for borrowing or viewing within the library. Magazine articles and archives may contain information about the newspaper, but they are not a direct source for obtaining a specific title. Safe deposit boxes are typically used for storing valuable items such as jewelry or important documents, and a page is a part of a book or document, not a location for obtaining a newspaper.
Answer:
library
Question: If you want to find a star you'd have to look in space, but if you wanted to find one from the screen you should travel to where?
Options: A) outer space, B) uganda, C) constellation, D) solar system, E) hollywood,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is not about finding an actual star in the sky, but rather a celebrity that is famous and well-known. Since the other options do not have any relevance to the world of entertainment or celebrities, the answer must be "hollywood" which is a famous location known for being the center of the movie industry and the place where many celebrities live and work.
Answer:
hollywood
Question: What is it called when animals produce offspring?
Options: A) birth, B) reproduce asexually, C) lie down, D) procreate, E) feel pain,
Knowledge: Procreation refers specifically to the act of animals (and humans) reproducing and producing offspring. The other options do not accurately describe the process of reproduction or are unrelated to the question. "Birth" involves the delivery of offspring, rather than the act of producing them. "Reproduce asexually" refers to a type of reproduction that does not involve the combination of genetic material from two parents. "Lie down" and "feel pain" do not have any connection to reproduction.
Answer:
procreate
Question: I was depressed and my friends threw me a party, why did they do that?
Options: A) reciprocity, B) make happy, C) make money, D) get drunk, E) embarrassing yourself,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker was feeling down and their friends threw them a party to help cheer them up. The phrase "make happy" directly relates to this situation, as it implies that the friends were trying to improve the speaker's mood. Reciprocity, getting drunk, and embarrassing oneself do not fit the context of the sentence. Making money is also unlikely as a motive for this kind of gesture.
Answer:
make happy
Question: Sam wasn't in a rush to shop.  That allowed him to be more mindful and do what?
Options: A) slow down, B) leisure, C) take time, D) delay, E) go slowly,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sam was not in a hurry while shopping, which allowed him to be more mindful. Being mindful typically involves taking time to pay attention to one's surroundings, thoughts, and feelings. Therefore, the correct answer is "take time." The other options either do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence or are too similar to the correct answer.
Answer:
take time
Question: Where could you find a stray small dog?
Options: A) animal shelter, B) big house, C) own home, D) georgia, E) on a leash,
Knowledge: A stray dog is one that has been lost or abandoned and is wandering without a home or owner. Therefore, the most likely place to find a stray dog would be an animal shelter, as they often take in and care for lost or abandoned animals until they can be reunited with their owners or adopted by new families. The other options do not necessarily have a connection to finding a stray dog, as a big house or own home may imply the dog already has an owner, while on a leash implies that the dog already has an owner who is taking them for a walk.
Answer:
animal shelter
Question: The small dog spent a lot of time with the elderly, where did he volunteer?
Options: A) own house, B) nursing home, C) park, D) own home, E) suburb,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the small dog volunteered somewhere, and given the context of spending time with the elderly, a nursing home is the most likely option. Nursing homes are often associated with elderly care and volunteering opportunities, especially for therapy dogs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
nursing home
Question: Bill was a weasel, but he's a weasel you wanted on your side.  He held what?
Options: A) public office, B) out of doors, C) candles, D) chicken coop, E) barn,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite being a weasel, Bill was someone you would want on your side. This implies that he had a particular skill or ability that made him valuable. Additionally, the phrase "public office" suggests a position of power or influence, which could be useful when trying to gain an advantage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
public office

Options: A) cuba, B) fish market, C) books, D) france, E) canada,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a specific location where one can find information about the anatomy of a blowfish in print. The most likely source of this information would be in a book, as it is a common medium for educational materials. The other choices are not relevant or do not have a clear connection to the subject matter.
Answer:
books
Question: Talking to others can make you feel better, but when the people you talk to are mean, then can cause what?
Options: A) dry mouth, B) changing behavior, C) hurt feelings, D) communicating with others, E) anger,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that talking to others can improve our emotional state, but if those individuals are mean or hurtful, they can have the opposite effect and cause negative emotions such as hurt feelings. The other options, dry mouth, changing behavior, communicating with others, and anger, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not mentioned as potential outcomes of talking to mean people.
Answer:
hurt feelings
Question: Everyone is ordinary but we are often told we are what?
Options: A) unbelievable, B) strange, C) special, D) ugly, E) exceptional,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite everyone being ordinary, they are often told that they possess a quality that sets them apart from others. The word "special" fits this context, as it connotes a unique quality that makes someone stand out from the crowd. The other options, such as "ugly" and "strange," do not fit the positive tone of the sentence and are not supported by the context. "Unbelievable" and "exceptional" may be fitting options, but "special" is the most appropriate given the context of the sentence.
Answer:
special
Question: what can one add to a building to increase it's size?
Options: A) city, B) town, C) rooms, D) fall down, E) urban area,
Knowledge: The question implies that something can be added to a building to increase its size. Out of the options given, only "rooms" makes sense as something that can be added to a building. "City", "town", and "urban area" refer to geographic locations, while "fall down" is obviously the opposite of what the question is asking for.
Answer:
rooms
Question: Where might someone drive through rows of apple tree?
Options: A) countryside, B) mountains, C) front yard, D) wisconsin, E) washington state,
Knowledge: Rows of apple trees are commonly found in orchards, which are often located in rural areas such as the countryside. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of driving through rows of apple trees. The mountains may have trees, but apple orchards are not commonly found at high altitude. Front yards may have apple trees, but they would not be arranged in rows like in an orchard. Wisconsin and Washington State are known for apple production, but simply being in those states does not necessarily indicate that someone would be driving through rows of apple trees.
Answer:
countryside
Question: Most animals get tired, and when they do they what?
Options: A) bite, B) groom, C) procreate, D) keep alive, E) lie down,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when animals get tired, they do something to rest or take a break. Biting or grooming does not necessarily help them rest, while procreation and keeping alive are not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be "lie down," which is a common way animals rest when they are tired.
Answer:
lie down
Question: Where would you buy candy and other foods?
Options: A) movies, B) supermarket, C) mall, D) jar, E) television,

Movies may have a concession stand that sells candy, but it wouldn't typically offer a wide variety of foods. Malls may have food courts and snack stands, but they are not primarily focused on selling grocery items. Jar and television are also not places where people would typically purchase food items.

Question: The claustrophobic person was getting in line, what did they feel?
Options: A) anxiety, B) wait turn, C) late, D) terrible, E) nauseous,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the claustrophobic person was feeling a certain emotion while getting in line. Claustrophobia is a fear of confined spaces, which can cause anxiety and panic in those who suffer from it. The other options, such as "wait turn" and "late," do not have a direct connection to the claustrophobia described in the sentence. "Nauseous" may be a physical reaction to anxiety, but it is not specific to claustrophobia. "Terrible" is too vague to be a likely answer.
Answer:
anxiety

Options: A) found in stall, B) farmhouse, C) doing farm work, D) ridden, E) found on ranch,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the horse had given many rides that day and was likely tired, so it is reasonable to assume that he would have been resting in his stall. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The option "ridden" is incorrect because it doesn't provide an answer to where the horse was found.
Answer:
found in stall
Question: What was the practical husband concerned most about when house shopping?
Options: A) arriving, B) location, C) excitement, D) movement, E) expense,

The other choices (arriving, location, excitement, movement) do not seem to have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: Where might I find a decanter outside of drinking alcohol?
Options: A) georgia, B) kitchen cupboard, C) brewery, D) chemistry lab, E) restaurant,
Knowledge: The word "decanter" is often associated with pouring liquids, and in a chemistry lab, it may be used to transfer chemicals from one container to another. Decanters are also commonly used to aerate wine before drinking, but this answer choice is outside of the scope of the question, as it specifies "outside of drinking alcohol." The kitchen cupboard and restaurant answer choices do not have any clear connection to decanters, while the brewery answer choice specifies alcohol, which is excluded in the question.
Answer:
chemistry lab

Options: A) drink, B) begin work, C) have lunch, D) eat quickly, E) spend money,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person is hesitant to get food because work has been slow, which suggests that they may be short on money. This would make spending money on lunch an undesirable option. The other choices do not directly relate to the context of the sentence - drinking, beginning work, or eating quickly may not necessarily require spending money, and having lunch is not necessarily an action that one would avoid due to financial concerns.
Answer:
spend money

Options: A) park, B) delaware, C) lawn, D) planting, E) washington,
Knowledge: Rosebushes are typically planted in areas with well-drained soil and plenty of sunlight.

This suggests that the correct answer should be related to the practicality or usefulness of the products.

A blizzard is a severe winter storm that includes heavy snowfall and strong winds, so the cold temperature and heavy precipitation described in the sentence fit with this type of storm.

Options: A) quit veganism, B) have food, C) make bread, D) eat vegetables, E) eat quickly,
Knowledge: The sentence says the vegan was tired of being hungry, which implies that they were not eating enough food to satisfy their hunger. Since the vegan has not yet quit veganism, it is likely that they will choose an option that aligns with their dietary restrictions. Eating vegetables would be a logical choice since they are a staple in a vegan diet and are known to be filling and nutritious. Making bread or eating quickly may not necessarily alleviate hunger, and having food is too general without any mention of what type of food.
Answer:
eat vegetables

"Eat food" is not a valid answer as the question is not asking about what to do during lunch. "Stop working" is not necessarily a requirement for having lunch, and "spend money" may not be applicable in all situations as one can also bring their own food. "Prepare food" is also a valid answer but it is not as specific as "get food" which implies going out or acquiring food from somewher.

The phrase "he knew it was time to stop" implies that he was becoming fatigued and needed to rest. The other options, such as sore feet or leg cramps, might also be a result of running for a long time, but they do not necessarily indicate that it is time to stop.

Options: A) alley, B) lap, C) cellar, D) street, E) home,
Knowledge: Tabby cats are domesticated animals and are typically happiest and most comfortable in a familiar, safe environment such as their home. The other options may not provide the same level of comfort or safety for the cat. For example, an alley or street would not be a safe place for a cat, while a cellar may be too dark and isolated for a social animal like the tabby cat. Laps may provide comfort, but a cat still needs their own space to retreat to, which is usually found in their home.

This loss of memory is referred to as forgetting, as opposed to forgotten, which implies that the memory has already been lost. Rehabilitating and forgetfulness both suggest an attempt to improve or treat John's memory loss, which is not mentioned in the sentence. Last forever is also incorrect because it does not accurately reflect John's current situation.
Answer:
forgetting

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something will be made easier during good weather in the winter. Climbing and riding a bike are physical activities that may not necessarily be affected by the weather, so they are less likely to be the correct answer. "Go somewhere" is too vague and does not provide enough context to choose it as the correct answer. "Travel" is the most likely answer because winter weather often makes travel difficult, with snow and ice causing delays and cancellations. Good weather would make travel easier by improving visibility and making roads safer to drive on.
Answer:
travel
Question: Where can you put your plants to make sure they get plenty of sunlight?
Options: A) roof, B) ground, C) park, D) surface of earth, E) windowsill,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the plants are indoors and need sunlight, which suggests that they are in a pot or container. The options "roof," "park," and "surface of earth" are not relevant to the context of indoor plant care. While plants can certainly be placed in the ground outside and still get plenty of sunlight, the sentence specifies that the question is about how to ensure they get sunlight indoors. This leaves "windowsill" as the most logical choice, as placing plants on a windowsill is a common way to ensure they get sufficient sunlight while indoors.
Answer:
windowsill

Answer:

The option "cheap" is related, but it does not specifically refer to the quality of the food. The options "convenient", "bad workmanship", and "poor workmanship" are unrelated and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
bad taste
Question: Where does a car belong?
Options: A) air port, B) repair shop, C) road, D) race track, E) freeway,
Knowledge: A car is a vehicle designed to travel on roads, making "road" the most logical choice. While a car may visit an airport or repair shop, these locations are not where a car belongs. A race track or freeway are also possibilities, but not all cars are designed for racing or high-speed travel, so "road" is the most universally applicable choice.
Answer:
road

Options: A) stumbling, B) nausea, C) fights, D) death, E) your head hit the ground,

Knowledge: The sentence suggests a contrast between a pile of something in the driveway (presumably snow) and the peaceful appearance of a snowflake. The only option that relates to the appearance of a snowflake is "air," as snowflakes are individual, delicate and graceful in the air. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: The farmer knew the potatoes wouldn't grow in the city, so where did he look for a plot?
Options: A) restaurant, B) julienne, C) countryside, D) plate, E) fried,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer knew that potatoes would not grow in the city, which implies that he must look for a rural or agricultural area where he could find suitable land to plant potatoes. The choice "countryside" is the most logical since it is associated with farming and agriculture, and it is where farmers usually cultivate their crops. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
countryside
Question: Where do you play board games?
Options: A) shelf, B) toy store, C) shelter, D) house, E) den,
Knowledge: Board games are typically played indoors, and the most common indoor location for playing board games is in someone's home, such as their house or den. The other options, such as shelf or toy store, are not locations where board games are typically played but may be places where they are stored or purchased. The term "shelter" could refer to a variety of locations, but it is not clear from the question whether it is a indoor or outdoor location.
Answer:

Options: A) fast food restaurant, B) bookstore, C) supermarket, D) shop, E) grocery store,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the workplace is informal and that the cashier loves antiques. A shop is more likely to have an informal atmosphere and sell antiques than a fast food restaurant, supermarket, or grocery store. While a bookstore may also have an informal atmosphere, there is no mention in the sentence of the cashier having a love for books or literature.
Answer:
shop

Additionally, the sentence mentions that there is no land in sight, further suggesting that he is in a large body of water such as the ocean. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
ocean
Question: what is a type of science?
Options: A) space lab, B) nanotechnology, C) university, D) methodology, E) school,
Knowledge: The other options listed are not types of science. "Space lab" and "university" refer to physical locations, while "methodology" and "school" are more general terms that could refer to a variety of fields. "Nanotechnology," on the other hand, is a specific field of science that deals with materials and devices of a very small scale, typically at the nanometer level. Therefore, it is the correct answer.

nanotechnology
Question: She wanted to try out her brand new hair dryer, but her hair practically dried on it's own before she got it out of the well packaged what?
Options: A) bathroom, B) trash, C) drug store, D) beauty salon, E) box,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hair dryer was still in its original packaging, which would most likely be a box. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The bathroom could be a possible location for using a hair dryer, but it does not explain why the hair would have already dried before she took the dryer out. The trash and drug store are not relevant to the sentence at all, and the beauty salon is not a likely location for someone using a brand new hair dryer at home.
Answer:
box

Question: What moving object will a person be happy to have?
Options: A) catch cold, B) experience joy, C) submarine, D) believe in god, E) own car,
Knowledge: The question is asking which moving object will make a person happy to have, and out of the options given, only "own car" fits that description. Catching a cold is a negative experience, experiencing joy is a feeling rather than an object, a submarine is not typically owned or associated with happiness, and believing in God is a personal belief rather than a physical object. Therefore, "own car" is the correct answer.
Answer:
own car

The other options are not related to the context of the sentence and do not provide an accurate or relevant answer.
Answer:

Options: A) leave dock, B) coming home, C) row boat, D) sail boat, E) board ship,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a sailor must complete preparation work before the ship can leave, implying that the sailor has already arrived at the dock or harbor where the ship is located. Therefore, the first step the sailor must take is to board the ship. The other options do not address the initial step required for the ship to leave, and "coming home" is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: Where can you find a barber shop north of the U.S.?
Options: A) small town, B) neighborhood, C) high street, D) motel, E) canada,

public place
Question: My ficus isn't in my house, but it is protected from bugs, where did I place it?
Options: A) window, B) clay pot, C) pots, D) screened porch, E) shady places,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ficus plant is not inside the house but is still protected from bugs, which rules out placing it near windows or in shady places where insects are more likely to be. Clay pots or multiple pots do not necessarily offer bug protection, and the choice of words "protected from bugs" implies a deliberate effort to keep the plant safe from pests, which is often easier to achieve in an enclosed or screened area such as a porch.
Answer:
screened porch
Question: The general didn't like it, but sometimes it is something you have to do, what did he do?
Options: A) make haste, B) make war, C) take time, D) make peace, E) urinate,

Answer:
make war

Options: A) water, B) comb, C) military base, D) seville, E) small town,
Knowledge: It is a common practice for barbers to use a comb to style and tidy up a customer's hair before they leave the shop. Water may be used to wet the hair or clean the razor, but it is not typically used right before leaving. Military base and Seville have no clear connection to the context of a barber shop, and small town is too general to be a specific answer.
Answer:
comb
Question: Where would a gazelle like to run?
Options: A) uphill, B) open field, C) asia, D) encyclopedia, E) steppe,
Knowledge: Gazelles are known for their speed and agility and are typically found in grasslands and open areas where they can easily run and maneuver. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "open field", as it is the only option that is associated with an environment that would be suitable for a gazelle to run in. The other options, such as "uphill", "asia", and "encyclopedia", have no clear connection to the behavior of gazelles. "Steppe" may be a plausible choice, but it is less specific than "open field" and may not necessarily evoke the same mental image of a vast and unobstructed landscape.
Answer:
open field
Question: What is something that people could walk on and that could have a steel cable attached to it?
Options: A) rowboat, B) ground, C) suspension bridge, D) ship, E) building,
Knowledge: The use of the words "steel cable" suggest that the correct answer involves something that is suspended or hanging, and that can support weight. Only a suspension bridge fits this description, as it is constructed using steel cables and can support the weight of people walking across it. The other options do not involve a steel cable or the ability to support weight in the same way.
Answer:
suspension bridge

Options: A) discount, B) refund, C) less money, D) death and, E) free money,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill had to pay taxes on the full price, regardless of any special deal or offer he received. The word "discount" indicates that Bill received a reduced price, but he still had to pay taxes on the original amount. The other options do not provide any clear indication of why Bill had to pay tax on the full price. "Refund" and "less money" both suggest that the price was reduced, but do not indicate why Bill had to pay taxes on the full amount. "Death and" and "free money" are not related to the context of the sentence at all.
Answer:
discount

Options: A) auditorium, B) stadium, C) arena, D) city, E) area,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was unable to attend an event because the ticket office was sold out and that the event was likely related to football. Since the other options (auditorium, arena, city, and area) don't specifically relate to hosting football-related events, the correct answer is likely stadium, which is a venue commonly used for sports events such as football games.
Answer:

The only option that meets these criteria is "carpet," which is a common flooring material used in many homes as an alternative to wood. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not commonly found in people's homes or do not replace wood in any way.
Answer:
carpet

Knowledge: Saying farewell to someone is often accompanied by a wave goodbye, which is a common gesture used to signify goodbye or farewell.

Question: You are covered with what when you're having a bath?
Options: A) cleanness, B) exfoliation, C) use water, D) wetness, E) rash,
Knowledge: When taking a bath, your body becomes wet because you are submerging yourself in water. "Cleanness" is a result of a bath, not something that covers you during it. "Exfoliation" refers to the process of removing dead skin cells, which may occur during a bath but isn't something that covers you. "Use water" is not a covering but an action that is taken during a bath. "Rash" is a skin irritation and not something that covers you during a bath.
Answer:
wetness

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the first team had a significant lead over the second team, with over 100 points compared to the second team trailing by more than 50 points. This implies that the second team is likely to lose the game, as they have a lot of ground to make up in order to catch up with the first team. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
lose
Question: What could happen to someone if he or she finds out that he or she is going somewhere?
Options: A) being there, B) get excited, C) arriving, D) airplane, E) having to travel,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that finding out about going somewhere has a positive connotation, which is often associated with the feeling of excitement.

The other options may not make as much sense or may be too specific to the mode of transportation.
Answer:
get excited
Question: The old clothes weren't even useful as rags, they belonged where?
Options: A) loft, B) trash, C) attic, D) fire pit, E) trunk,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the old clothes were not useful even as rags, implying that they were in very poor condition and could not be salvaged.

Answer:

Options: A) laundromat, B) assembly line, C) street, D) white house, E) house,

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - assembly lines typically involve automated machinery, streets are not typically associated with machines that take quarters, the White House is a government building and not a place where laundry is done, and simply "house" is too vague to make a clear connection.
Answer:
laundromat

Options: A) province, B) workplace, C) construction business, D) law, E) club,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sam is employed at a union shop, meaning a workplace where employees are represented by a labor union. In such workplaces, joining the union may be a requirement for continued employment, as the union negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the employer on behalf of its members. Sam not wanting to join the union suggests that he may have personal objections to being in a union, but if he wants to continue working at the shop, he has no choice but to join or leave the workplace. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
workplace

Knowledge: Divorce is often associated with emotional struggles and grief, especially for the person getting divorced. Studies have shown that divorce can lead to symptoms of depression and anxiety, and often involves a period of adjustment and recovery. The other options are not necessarily negative effects of divorce, and some may even be considered positive, depending on the individual's perspective. For example, "freedom" and "no spouse" may be seen as positive outcomes for someone who feels trapped or unhappy in their marriage. "Happiness" may also be a desired outcome, but it is not necessarily the result of divorce for everyone. "Children suffer" is also a commonly cited negative effect of divorce, but it involves other people and is not specified in the question.
Answer:
lot of grief

The options "bus station" and "bus" may be tempting choices, but the key word "sections" suggests that the vehicle being referred to is not a bus, which is usually made up of a single compartment. The other options, "park" and "town," are not relevant to the context of the question.
Answer:
train station

The option "his death" is incorrect because it is not a natural consequence of the man being exhausted and needing rest.
Answer:
sleep

Options: A) earn money, B) introduction, C) create, D) workhour, E) produce goods,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person enjoyed working in a factory, which implies that they were involved in some form of production. The phrase "for sale" further emphasizes this point, as it implies that the goods produced were intended for commercial purposes. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence. "Earn money" is a possible motivation for working in a factory, but it doesn't explain what the person actually did. "Introduction" and "workhour" don't make sense in this context. "Create" is a possibility, but it is less specific than "produce goods."
Answer:
produce goods

The word "good" suggests that the outcome was desirable, and the context of the sentence implies that this outcome was a result of the person's diligence.

Answer:

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the expert is performing on stage and is hoping for something positive to happen. The options "explode," "stage fright," and "injury" all suggest negative outcomes, which are unlikely to be the expert's goal. "Getting attention" could be a goal, but it is not a clear indication of success since the attention could be positive or negative. "Being appreciated" is a more positive and specific goal, which would imply that the audience is enjoying and valuing the performance.

Options: A) relax, B) frustration, C) pleasure, D) controversy, E) park,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being interrupted while creating art can have a negative impact on the artist, as the word "likely" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between interruptions and an emotional response.

"Park" is unrelated to the sentence and can be eliminated as an option.

Question: James raked fallen leaves into a pile. Where might he leave the pile?
Options: A) forest, B) roof, C) garden, D) tree, E) ground,
Knowledge: Since James is raking leaves, it is logical to assume that he will leave the pile on the ground, which is where the leaves were before he gathered them. Leaves are usually left on the ground to decompose and provide nutrients for the soil, or they may be collected into compost bins. The other options do not make sense in this context; leaving the pile on a roof or in a tree, for example, would be impractical and unlikely.

While playing poker can be casual and for fun, the reference to tournaments and prizes highlights the importance of competition.

Options: A) desktop, B) headphones, C) town halls, D) concert, E) conference,
Knowledge: The word "rows and rows" suggests a large number of speakers, which is typically associated with concerts or other large events where sound needs to fill a large space.

Options: A) crooked, B) curved, C) bent, D) straightforth, E) broken,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally did not like the straight blade of the sword she saw. This implies that she is looking for a sword with a different shape.

Answer:

The other options, such as making money or success, are not necessarily negative outcomes and do not directly relate to the context of the sentence. Failure could also be a possible outcome, but it is not specified in the sentence.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Knowledge: Birthdays and Christmas are traditionally occasions where people give and receive gifts. The other options are less commonly associated with these specific occasions. While someone might understand themselves better on their birthday or have a moment of self-reflection, it is not necessarily a common or expected activity. Compliments and acknowledgment might be exchanged, but they are not a central aspect of the celebration. Drinking might occur as part of a festive atmosphere, but it is not a defining characteristic of birthdays or Christmas.
Answer:
receive gifts

The other options, such as "penguins" and "relax," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: The security detail had to keep an eye on the entire crowd, they were constantly scanning all the what?
Options: A) potato, B) body, C) focus, D) faces, E) person's head,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the security detail was scanning something that could help them keep an eye on the entire crowd. The option "potato" is unrelated and does not make sense in context. "Body" and "person's head" are too specific and would not allow the security detail to keep track of everyone in the crowd. "Focus" is too vague and doesn't fit the context. Therefore, the most logical answer is "faces" because it is common for security personnel to continually scan the faces of people in a crowd to identify potential threats or individuals of interest.
Answer:
faces

Options: A) turn on electricity, B) open eyes, C) kill, D) plug in, E) watch television,

The other options (turn on electricity, open eyes, kill, watch television) do not make sense in this context.
Answer:
plug in

A public building, such as a government building or courthouse, may also be a location for holding court, but it is less likely for a ruler to hold court in a public setting. A city or gymnasium are not appropriate locations for holding court, while a conference room may be used for important meetings or negotiations, but it is not a traditional location for holding court.
Answer:

Knowledge: The sentence states that the peaceful nation is scared of their neighbor amassing troops at the border, which implies that the neighbor is showing hostile and aggressive behavior. Belligerent means hostile and aggressive, making it the most suitable answer. The other options do not reflect the context of the sentence as the fear is not about warring or violence in general, nor is it about a constitutional referendum.
Answer:
belligerent

Options: A) classroom, B) university, C) homeschool, D) parents school, E) ask questions,

It's important to note that homeschooling can be done in different ways, such as through online programs or with the help of teachers/tutors, but the key characteristic is that it is primarily taught at home.
Answer:

Options: A) house, B) kitchen, C) car, D) drugstore, E) bedroom,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Denny was searching for his hairbrush in his living space, which eliminates the options of car and drugstore. The fact that he closed the door behind him hints that he was searching in a room, which could be his bedroom or any other room in the house. However, since the sentence doesn't provide any cues about his morning routine or where he usually keeps his hairbrush, bedroom seems like the most logical option.
Answer:
bedroom

Options: A) effectively treated, B) cause hallucination, C) managed, D) ameliorated, E) recur,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that stopping medication may lead to the return of symptoms, which is commonly referred to as a recurrence. This is a known risk for individuals with mental illnesses who stop taking their medication, as medication is often used to manage and ameliorate symptoms. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they suggest different outcomes from stopping medication.
Answer:

The other options do not provide a clear answer to the question, as they are not related to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
brother's house

The options are listed in random order and the correct choice can be determined by listing them alphabetically.

The other options are not in close proximity to Atlantic alphabetically.
Answer:
atlantic

Options: A) gaining knowledge, B) effectiveness, C) distress, D) dysfunction, E) happiness,

This may occur when the learning material is particularly challenging or when the learner feels overwhelmed by the amount of information presented. Dysfunction is also a possibility, but it is not as closely associated with the process of learning as distress is. Happiness is not typically considered a negative emotion or feeling associated with learning.
Answer:
distress

Options: A) orchard, B) conservation land, C) countryside, D) yard, E) surface of earth,

An orchard usually is a designated area specifically for growing fruit trees and is not commonly found in residential areas.

Surface of earth is a broad and vague option that does not provide any specific context related to the question.
Answer:

Options: A) good heart, B) make up, C) new freedom, D) good karma, E) bad man,

The other options do not fit with the concept of forgiveness - "make up" and "new freedom" are not characteristics that someone can have, "good karma" is associated with positive actions and consequences rather than personality traits, and "bad man" is the opposite of forgiving.
Answer:
good heart

Knowledge: The question is asking for a game to play with children using a round toy. "Play ball" is a common game played with children using a round ball as the toy. The other options do not fit the criteria of using a round toy. "Play with toys" is too vague and could refer to any type of toy, while "play sports" and "throw things" do not specifically mention using a round toy. "Frisbee" is a specific toy, but it is not always in the shape of a round disc and may not be suitable for younger children.
Answer:
play ball
Question: Where can I go to see a really big toy balloon floating at the top of a dome?
Options: A) parade, B) circus, C) amusement park, D) birthday party, E) magic show,

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Options: A) medicine cabinet, B) grocery store, C) diaper bag, D) dishwasher, E) liquor store,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a baby bottle that they packed, which indicates that they are likely traveling with a baby. The options "medicine cabinet," "grocery store," "dishwasher," and "liquor store" do not make sense in this context. "Diaper bag" is the most logical choice because it is a place where one would typically pack items for a baby when traveling with them.
Answer:
diaper bag

Options: A) restaurant, B) backyard, C) work, D) summer, E) louisiana,
Knowledge: The question is asking about a place to cook BBQ, which generally refers to a method of outdoor cooking. The option "restaurant" is unlikely to be the correct answer as it suggests that someone would go to a commercial establishment to cook their own food. "Work" and "summer" are not locations and therefore do not fit the context of the question. "Louisiana" may be known for its BBQ but it does not provide a specific location. "Backyard" is the most logical answer as it is a common location for home BBQs.
Answer:
backyard

Options: A) use television, B) see exhibits, C) read book, D) design software, E) taking a walk,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe was motivated by curiosity to pursue a certain career. The option "design software" seems the most relevant as it requires curiosity and creativity to create new software designs.

"Read book" and "taking a walk" are not typically considered careers.

Options: A) washington state, B) illinois, C) indiana, D) swamp, E) woods,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the man picked the apple from a tree outside of Chicago, so it is likely that the apple came from a nearby location.

The other options, such as Washington state, a swamp or woods, are not geographically related to the sentence and do not provide any relevant information.
Answer:

Options: A) blossom, B) vase, C) park, D) cast shadow, E) open,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sarah enjoyed the scent of the roses, which is typically associated with the blossoming stage of the flower rather than when it is a closed bud (i.e., not yet open). The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as a vase or a park do not give context to the act of smelling, nor does "cast shadow" or "open" have relevance to the sentence.
Answer:
blossom
Question: Everyone is special. Everyone has what?
Options: A) feelings, B) unique personality, C) values, D) experiences, E) different standards,

Personality is often a term used to describe a person's distinctive character, behavior, and attitude traits that distinguish them from others.

The word "perfect" suggests that these disasters have occurred in a particularly complete or thorough way, further emphasizing the severity of the situation.

Answer:

Options: A) tide pool, B) dictionary, C) sea water, D) south pacific, E) movie scene,
Knowledge: Anemones are marine animals that typically live in saltwater environments. The options "tide pool" and "sea water" are both related to marine environments, but tide pools are small bodies of water that form along rocky coastlines during low tide, and may not necessarily contain anemones. "South Pacific" is a region, and "movie scene" and "dictionary" are not related to the context of the question. Therefore, "sea water" is the most likely correct answer.
Answer:
sea water
Question: Why is a person likely to stop eating hamburger and save the rest for later?
Options: A) sadness, B) being full, C) heartburn, D) food poisoning, E) death,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is no longer hungry and chooses to save the remaining hamburger for later consumption. This suggests that the person has eaten a sufficient amount of food and is now "full." The other options do not provide a relevant reason for stopping to eat the hamburger. Sadness and death are unlikely to be related to food consumption, while heartburn and food poisoning may cause a person to stop eating but are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
being full

Options: A) lots of tickets, B) interesting experiences, C) compliments, D) feel pleasure, E) look attractive,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that traveling to many different places will result in a variety of experiences, not all of which may be enjoyable. Therefore, it is likely that the person will have interesting experiences, which is a broad term that can encompass a range of activities, sights, and interactions with people from different cultures. The other options do not logically follow from the context of the sentence - having lots of tickets or receiving compliments are not necessarily indicative of travel experiences, feeling pleasure is too general of a term, and looking attractive is not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
interesting experiences

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.

The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: His rural dental office was never crowded, but since moving where it has been nonstop crowded?
Options: A) medical building, B) urban area, C) strip mall, D) city, E) metro area,
Knowledge: The sentence contrasts the previous location, a rural area, with the current location, which is now nonstop crowded. This suggests that the new location is in a more populous and urban setting. The options "medical building" and "strip mall" could potentially be in an urban or rural area, but do not provide enough information to determine the correct answer. "City" and "metro area" also fit the context of an urban setting, but are more general terms that do not specifically refer to a specific type of location.

Options: A) surface of earth, B) windowsill, C) park, D) roof tiles, E) greenhouse,

Plants are not typically found on the surface of the earth or on roof tiles. While a park may have plants, it is not a location within someone's house. A greenhouse is a location where plants can be grown, but it is not necessarily a feature in someone's house.
Answer:
windowsill

Infants are not able to take care of themselves and can easily drown in just a few inches of water. Therefore, it is important to never leave a baby alone during bath time. The other options do not align with the potential danger of leaving a baby unattended during a bath.
Answer:
will drown
Question: American humans just graduated high school, where are many of them bound?
Options: A) university, B) park, C) unemployment, D) cafe, E) movies,
Knowledge: Graduating high school typically marks the beginning of higher education for many Americans. Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is "university." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
university
Question: James sat in a chair and listened to the speaker.  Where might James be?
Options: A) synagogue, B) grocery store, C) auditorium, D) confession, E) office,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is in a place where a speaker is addressing an audience, which is a characteristic commonly associated with an auditorium. Synagogues, groceries stores, and offices are unlikely to have a speaker addressing an audience, and confession is a religious practice that typically takes place in a private setting rather than in a public space with a speaker.
Answer:
auditorium
Question: Evening began to fall and the woods came to life with different animals that preferred the what?
Options: A) daytime, B) night, C) afternoon, D) early morning, E) dawn,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the animals in the woods became more active as evening began to fall, indicating that they are likely nocturnal animals that prefer to be active at night. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they either refer to times of day when animals are typically less active or not active at all.
Answer:
night
Question: Having food all the time can lead to what?
Options: A) digesting, B) not hungry, C) swelling, D) weight gain, E) gas,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that having access to food all the time can have negative consequences, which likely include gaining weight. Eating more calories than one burns can lead to weight gain over time. The other options are less likely to be connected to the context of the sentence: "digesting" is not a negative consequence, "not hungry" suggests a lack of consequences rather than a negative one, "swelling" may happen occasionally but is not generally a consequence of having food available all the time, and "gas" is also an unlikely consequence.
Answer:
weight gain
Question: Where would you store a violin along with all of your other instruments?
Options: A) string quartet, B) orchestra, C) band room, D) attic, E) music room,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is storing musical instruments. A violin is a traditional orchestral instrument and would likely be stored in a music room, where other instruments are typically kept. The other options (string quartet, orchestra, band room, attic) all describe places where music is played or performed, rather than stored.
Answer:
music room
Question: Who can I play with if I know how to play an upright piano?
Options: A) college, B) band, C) living room, D) military, E) house,
Knowledge: Playing an upright piano is typically associated with playing music in a group setting, such as a band, rather than an individual setting like a living room or house. It is also not typically associated with the college or military contexts.
Answer:
band
Question: The audience listened raptly.  They learned much from this.  What did the audience watch?
Options: A) show, B) theatre, C) arena, D) presentation, E) concert hall,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the audience was learning from what they were watching, which is a common characteristic of presentations. Presentations are often educational or informative, and the audience is there to listen and learn. The other options, such as shows and concerts, may not necessarily have an educational component and the audience may be there purely for entertainment purposes.
Answer:
presentation
Question: People wanted to get to their destination quickly, what did they invent?
Options: A) confession, B) toilets, C) national park, D) vehicles, E) supermarket,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people wanted to travel quickly, indicating a need for a mode of transportation. This makes the option "vehicles" the most logical choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the sentence, as confessions and toilets are not related to transportation and national parks and supermarkets do not address the need for speed.
Answer:
vehicles
Question: If you hear about terrible injustices while reading a newspaper what can happen?
Options: A) learning about world, B) grief, C) education, D) get angry, E) insight,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that reading about terrible injustices can elicit an emotional response. Getting angry is a common reaction to feeling outraged or indignant about something that is unjust. The other options, such as learning about the world or gaining insight, do not necessarily relate to an emotional response. Grief may be a possible reaction, but it is not as strongly suggested by the sentence as getting angry.
Answer:
get angry
Question: Where is liquor usually stored in a home?
Options: A) fraternity house, B) cabinet, C) bar, D) soft drink, E) night stand,
Knowledge: Liquor is commonly stored in a cabinet, also known as a liquor cabinet or a bar cabinet. This is because liquor needs to be stored in a cool, dark place and a cabinet allows for easy access and organization of the bottles. Fraternity houses may have liquor stored in various places, but it is not a common storage option in a typical home. Soft drinks and night stands are also not common places for liquor storage.
Answer:
cabinet
Question: If your evening meal isn't served on a dish, at what kind of eatery are you eating?
Options: A) plate, B) dinner, C) food market, D) near perfection, E) fast food restaurant,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the lack of a dish at an eatery is unusual, and suggests that the setting is likely to be a fast food restaurant where meals are typically served in disposable packaging or on trays rather than on traditional dinnerware like plates. The other choices don't provide any relevant information to help identify the location based on the given context.
Answer:
fast food restaurant
Question: Billy bought pencils and put them in his what?
Options: A) classroom, B) kitchen sink, C) backpack, D) cabinet, E) store,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy purchased something that can be easily carried around, as he "put them in his" backpack. Out of the given options, only a backpack is a portable item that can be used to carry things around. The other options such as classroom, kitchen sink, cabinet, and store are not suitable for carrying items like pencils around.
Answer:
backpack
Question: What is it called when the police take a suspect in to custody?
Options: A) arrest, B) force law, C) board vessels, D) direct traffic, E) raid,
Knowledge: The term "arrest" refers to the act of taking someone into police custody, usually because the person is suspected of committing a crime. The other choices do not have any connection to the context of the question, and are not related to the concept of police custody or law enforcement.
Answer:
arrest
Question: Family is always the best for devotion, but it is also nice if a person has what?
Options: A) good review, B) headache, C) with cat, D) loyal friends, E) shoes,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while family is always the best for devotion, having something else in addition is also nice. The phrase "loyal friends" is commonly associated with companionship, support, and loyalty, which would complement the support provided by family. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
loyal friends
Question: While doing housework you came across a dusty corner which caused you to start doing what?
Options: A) sneezing, B) tired, C) boredom, D) fatigue, E) anxiety,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dusty corner caused a physical reaction in the person doing housework. Sneezing is a common response to inhaling dust and other irritants, so it is the most likely choice. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not a common reaction to inhaling dust.
Answer:
sneezing
Question: Mandy was watching television because she had a long day.  She could do much else because she was experiencing what?
Options: A) joy, B) addiction, C) relaxation, D) fatigue, E) headaches,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mandy was watching television because she had a long day and couldn't do much else. This implies that she was likely feeling tired or fatigued, and therefore chose a low-energy activity such as watching TV. The other options are less likely, as joy would imply that she had a good day and was enjoying herself, addiction would imply a compulsive behavior that overrides feelings of fatigue, relaxation would imply a deliberate choice to unwind, and headaches would imply a physical discomfort that would likely prevent her from watching TV.
Answer:
fatigue
Question: She let him know he was being over the top, and that his antics where a little what?
Options: A) much, B) plenty, C) larger, D) lot of, E) big,
Knowledge: The phrase "over the top" is often used to describe behavior that is excessive or exaggerated. The word "much" is commonly used to convey a sense of excess or abundance, which is why it is the most appropriate option in this context. The other options do not convey the same sense of excessiveness as "much."
Answer:
much
Question: Where can someone get well water?
Options: A) oil field, B) field, C) countryside, D) kansas, E) ground,
Knowledge: Well water typically refers to water that is obtained from underground aquifers or wells that tap into them, making "ground" the most likely correct answer. While it is possible that someone could obtain water from a field or the countryside, it would likely require additional equipment or treatment to make it safe for drinking. An oil field, on the other hand, is not a likely source of well water as it typically involves the extraction of oil and gas, not water. Finally, Kansas is a specific location and does not necessarily have any relevance to the answer.
Answer:
ground
Question: what is a characteristic of one who want to give assistance?
Options: A) help one, B) helpful, C) listen, D) prepared, E) humanity,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a characteristic of someone who wants to give assistance, which implies a desire to be useful or supportive of others. The word "helpful" directly relates to this concept and is the most appropriate choice among the given options. "Listen" and "prepared" are good qualities for assisting others but do not specifically indicate a desire to provide help. "Humanity" is a vague characteristic that may or may not relate to assistance, depending on the context.
Answer:
helpful
Question: The arch was just one of many sites to see, but most preferred the stained glass at the what?
Options: A) doorway, B) cathedral, C) ancient rome, D) building, E) chapel,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that there are multiple sights to see, but most people prefer the stained glass at a specific location. The options "doorway", "ancient Rome", "building", and "chapel" do not accurately describe a specific location that would feature stained glass. However, "cathedral" is a common type of religious building that often contains intricate stained glass windows, making it a likely answer.
Answer:
cathedral
Question: If I wanted to look at a drum, where would I go?
Options: A) symphony orchestra, B) child's room, C) music store, D) rock band, E) parade,
Knowledge: Drums are a musical instrument that can be found in a variety of contexts, but the most likely place to find one to look at would be a music store. A symphony orchestra may have drums, but they would be part of a larger ensemble and likely not on display for viewing. A child's room may have a toy drum, but it is unlikely that this is what the question is referring to. A rock band may also have drums, but again, they would not be on display for viewing. A parade may feature drummers, but this is not a place where one could easily go to see a drum up close.
Answer:
music store
Question: The text made no sense, it was just a random what?
Options: A) sequence of words, B) book, C) hatred, D) fade, E) analyzing,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the text had no coherent meaning, indicating that it was just a sequence of words without any logical structure. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not convey the same lack of meaning or coherence. A book, for example, might be difficult to understand but would still have some structure or purpose, while hatred and fade do not relate to language or writing in the same way that analyzing or a sequence of words might.
Answer:
sequence of words
Question: The man was still up at 2:30 am, so he was using the television, what was he hoping he would accomplish?
Options: A) eye strain, B) falling asleep, C) laziness, D) boredom, E) get smarter,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was up late and using the television as a tool to help him accomplish something. The options "eye strain," "laziness," and "get smarter" do not fit the context of the sentence. "Boredom" is a possibility, but the context suggests that the man had a specific goal in mind. "Falling asleep," on the other hand, is a common reason for people to use the television late at night, as it can help to create a relaxed and drowsy environment.
Answer:
falling asleep
Question: What is water to someone?
Options: A) dangerous, B) blue, C) toxic, D) important, E) surface of earth,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a general description of water to someone, which suggests that the answer should be a broad and fundamental attribute of water. "Important" is the most suitable option because water is essential for all living organisms to survive and is critical for many human activities such as agriculture, industry, and transportation. The other options are either too specific or negative in their association with water.
Answer:
important
Question: Where did the farmer send the heifer to make money when she was no longer useful to the farm?
Options: A) sanctuary farm, B) cow pasture, C) countryside, D) cattle ranch, E) slaughterhouse,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the heifer was no longer useful to the farm, which may mean that it was either too old or unable to produce milk. In such cases, farmers usually sell the animal to make some money. Since "sanctuary farm" and "cow pasture" are not places that buy animals, they can be eliminated. "Countryside" is a generic term and does not specifically relate to the sale of animals. "Cattle ranch" may buy animals, but it is not a common practice to sell unproductive cows to ranches. Therefore, the correct answer is "slaughterhouse," which is where animals are killed and processed for food.
Answer:
slaughterhouse
Question: The art project called for a big wooden rod, so she went where to get one?
Options: A) hardware store, B) tree stump, C) old clock, D) old houses, E) broom closet,
Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the art project required a big wooden rod, which suggests that the item is not readily available in the immediate surroundings such as a tree stump or broom closet. The options "old clock" and "old houses" are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. A hardware store is a likely place to find a variety of wooden rods in different sizes and shapes.
Answer:
hardware store
Question: If you dont fail at life you are?
Options: A) completing, B) succeeding, C) passed, D) passing, E) good at it,
Knowledge: The sentence presents failure as the opposite of the answer, suggesting that the correct choice is a state of achievement or success. The options "completed" and "passed" suggest a one-time event, while "good at it" lacks specificity and could apply to any skill or activity. "Succeeding" and "passing" are both commonly used to describe ongoing progress and achievement, but "passing" implies a minimum standard of performance, while "succeeding" suggests a higher level of success.
Answer:
succeeding
Question: Worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain, why are they?
Options: A) wet soil, B) start to fall, C) dry soil, D) wet things, E) wet ground,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain, which suggests that moisture is playing a role here. It is a common phenomenon for worms to come out of soil when it is wet because they need moisture to breathe. If the soil becomes too compact or dry, they cannot move or breathe properly, and hence might die. Thus, it is more likely that the worms are coming out due to the presence of wet soil rather than dry soil or other wet things. The option "start to fall" seems to be unrelated to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
wet soil
Question: Where are people likely to enjoy a show?
Options: A) theater, B) wedding, C) in the garden, D) opera, E) convention,
Knowledge: The options include a few different types of events, but only one of them is specifically associated with shows: the theater. A theater is a venue designed for live performances, such as plays, musicals, and comedy shows. While some of the other options may involve entertainment or performances, they do not have the same strong connection to the idea of enjoying a show as the theater does.
Answer:
theater
Question: Where might you have to pay for a shopping bag now?
Options: A) restaurant, B) closet, C) at starbucks, D) supermarket, E) home,
Knowledge: Many supermarkets have started charging for plastic bags to reduce waste and promote reusable bags. This practice is becoming increasingly common around the world. Other options like a restaurant or Starbucks may also charge for a bag, but it's not as common. The options of closet and home are not relevant to the context of the question.
Answer:
supermarket
Question: What is a computer terminal?

Knowledge: A computer terminal is an electronic device that is used to interact with a computer system.

None of the other choices are relevant to the definition of a computer terminal.
Answer:

Question: She was known for be soft and sensitive, but when all their wills were tested she was the only one who stood what?
Options: A) non sensitive, B) resistant, C) stoic, D) hardened, E) uncaring,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject was known for being soft and sensitive, but in a situation where everyone's wills were tested, she stood out for being different. Being stoic means showing little emotion and not easily giving in to pressure, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options all suggest the opposite of being soft and sensitive.
Answer:
stoic
Question: There are many dance clubs and higher rates of obesity where?
Options: A) united states, B) ohio, C) toun, D) michigan, E) fast food restaurants,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a correlation between the presence of dance clubs and higher rates of obesity. Since the options are locations, we need to choose the one that is most likely to have both dance clubs and high rates of obesity. The United States is a large country with a diverse population that enjoys dancing and has high rates of obesity, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are too specific to be considered a general trend.
Answer:
united states
Question: A violin and three other instruments play in what?
Options: A) orchestra, B) rock band, C) school, D) string quartet, E) music room,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions a specific combination of instruments - a violin and three others - which is commonly associated with a string quartet. String quartets are often associated with classical music and are comprised of two violins, a viola, and a cello. The other options do not include this specific combination of instruments, and do not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
string quartet
Question: If your opponents in a marathon is very fast it is easy to fall what?
Options: A) lightly, B) behind, C) train, D) slowly, E) sitfast,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if your opponents in a marathon are very fast, you may have difficulty keeping up with them and may fall behind. The word "behind" specifically means to not be in front of or to not keep up with others. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Lightly" does not make sense in this context, "train" is not a verb that describes falling behind, "slowly" suggests moving at a leisurely pace, and "sitfast" is not a commonly used term.
Answer:
behind
Question: Where do you have to fan yourself in public watching people run and throw balls?
Options: A) sports stadium, B) sauna, C) living room, D) appliance store, E) hot room,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a public place where people run and throw balls and it is hot enough to require fanning oneself. A sports stadium is a logical choice because it is a place where sporting events occur where people run and throw balls, and it could get very hot with all of the physical activity and body heat. Saunas and hot rooms are also hot, but they are not typically places where people run and throw balls in public. Living rooms and appliance stores would not normally have this type of activity taking place.
Answer:
sports stadium
Question: I need to buy frozen food locally in the smaller shop, where would I go?
Options: A) grocery store, B) supermarket, C) refrigerator, D) freezer, E) fridge,
Knowledge: The sentence states that the person is looking to buy frozen food in a smaller shop, indicating that they are not looking for a large supermarket or chain store. The most likely place to find a smaller shop that sells frozen food is a local grocery store. The options of refrigerator, freezer, and fridge are not relevant as they are appliances used for storing food, not purchasing it.
Answer:
grocery store
Question: What is it called if a person has poor luck?
Options: A) schizophrenia, B) misfortune, C) fearful, D) skills, E) criticism,
Knowledge: The question asks for a word or phrase that describes a person who has bad luck. "Misfortune" is a commonly used term to describe someone who is experiencing bad luck or unfavorable circumstances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. "Schizophrenia" is a mental health condition, "fearful" describes a person who is afraid or anxious, "skills" pertains to abilities or competencies, and "criticism" refers to negative feedback or disapproval.
Answer:
misfortune
Question: Sometimes people are wronged, and sometimes getting revenge brings them what?
Options: A) being happy, B) satisfaction, C) ownership, D) joy, E) disappointment,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting revenge can bring people a certain feeling. "Satisfaction" is the most likely choice as it implies a sense of accomplishment or righting a wrong. "Being happy," "joy," and "ownership" are not commonly associated with revenge and therefore do not fit in the context of the sentence. "Disappointment" is the opposite of what the sentence is suggesting.
Answer:
satisfaction
Question: Dan is always giving assistance.  He what does he want to create for people?
Options: A) better circumstances, B) happiness, C) people helped, D) learning new skills, E) death,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan is providing assistance with the intention of creating something positive for people. "Better circumstances" is the most general and broad option that could encompass a wide range of situations where someone might need assistance, such as financial, emotional, or physical. Happiness and learning new skills are more specific outcomes, while "people helped" is too vague and does not provide a clear goal for Dan's actions. Death is not a plausible option as it does not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
better circumstances
Question: What do marine life use to shelter themselves from a shark?
Options: A) coral reef, B) television program, C) pacific ocean, D) open ocean, E) seaweed,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that marine life needs to shelter themselves from a shark, which indicates that the shark is a predator. Coral reefs are known to provide shelter and protection for various types of marine life, including small fish and crustaceans, which may explain why they are a viable option for sheltering oneself from a shark. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
coral reef
Question: Where do humans go to be entertained and eat popcorn?
Options: A) mall, B) country, C) movie theatre, D) park, E) university,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions eating popcorn while being entertained, which is commonly associated with watching movies. Movie theatres are typically known as places where people go to watch movies and enjoy snacks like popcorn. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
movie theatre
Question: Where do you go when you're about to board a vehicle on railing?
Options: A) railway station, B) deck, C) flight of stairs, D) porch, E) bus station,
Knowledge: The phrase "board a vehicle on railing" may refer to boarding a train or other rail-based transportation, which would be done at a railway station. The other options, such as deck or porch, are not typically associated with rail transportation. A flight of stairs may be found at a railway station, but it alone does not indicate rail transportation. A bus station would be used for accessing buses, not rail-based transportation.
Answer:
railway station
Question: Where are doctors known for going in their off time?
Options: A) nursing home, B) emergency room, C) medical office, D) school, E) golf course,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where doctors are known for going during their free time. While doctors may frequent places such as medical offices or schools for work-related reasons, the other locations listed (nursing home, emergency room) are not typically associated with leisure activities. The option "golf course" is a common stereotype of doctors enjoying golfing during their off time. Therefore, it is the most likely answer.
Answer:
golf course
Question: Where can you find a revolving door at a location you spend the night?
Options: A) new york, B) apartment, C) hotel lobby, D) public place, E) bank,
Knowledge: A revolving door is a common feature in hotel lobbies, as it allows for easy entrance and exit while also maintaining a comfortable temperature inside the building. It is less common in other locations such as banks or public places, which typically have standard doors or automatic sliding doors. While some apartment buildings may have revolving doors, it is not as common as in hotels, making hotel lobby the most likely answer. The mention of spending the night further supports the idea of a hotel lobby.
Answer:
hotel lobby
Question: Where is a bridge likely to be found?
Options: A) river bed, B) river valley, C) texas, D) california, E) over water,
Knowledge: Bridges are structures that are built to cross over bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans. Therefore, the most likely answer is "over water" because the purpose of a bridge is to provide a safe and stable path over a body of water. The other options may have bodies of water present, but they do not necessarily require a bridge in order to cross or navigate them.
Answer:
over water
Question: After studying science for years, what did the agnostic person begin to lose?
Options: A) astronomy, B) arts, C) faith, D) math, E) chemistry,
Knowledge: The word "agnostic" suggests that the person is uncertain or skeptical about the existence of a higher power or deity. The sentence suggests that the person has been studying science for a long time, which may have influenced their beliefs to the point where they have begun to lose faith. The other options, such as math or astronomy, do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
faith
Question: Billy found it easy to divide 9, because 9 was a what of 3?
Options: A) multiply, B) multiple, C) unite, D) multiplication, E) multiple,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that 9 is related to 3 as a multiple, which means that 9 is a product of 3 and another whole number. This is a common concept in basic arithmetic, where multiples are used to help students understand the relationships between numbers and their factors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: The electricity went out and nobody could see or hear the band, what was being attempted?
Options: A) building, B) bedroom, C) concert, D) opera, E) church,
Knowledge: The mention of a band suggests that the event being described was a musical performance, and the fact that the electricity went out indicates that the performance was being held indoors, possibly in a venue that relied on electricity for lighting and sound equipment. The options "building", "bedroom", "opera", and "church" do not necessarily have any connection to a musical performance, while "concert" is the most likely option given the context.
Answer:
concert
Question: Where does a potato become softer?
Options: A) optical device, B) garden patch, C) blender, D) pantry, E) vegetable stew,
Knowledge: The question is asking where a potato becomes softer, indicating that it is already a potato and needs to be cooked or prepared in some way. The options "optical device," "blender," and "pantry" are clearly not related to the process of cooking or softening a potato. A garden patch is where potatoes are grown, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a potato will become softer by being in the garden. Therefore, the correct answer must be "vegetable stew," which is a dish that involves cooking vegetables, including potatoes, in liquid until they become soft and tender.
Answer:
vegetable stew
Question: Someone left their shopping bag behind when they grabbed a bit to eat, where is the bag likely?
Options: A) atlantis, B) retail store, C) closet, D) grocery store, E) restaurant,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone forgot their shopping bag when they went to eat. Since the bag was likely intended for carrying items from a shopping trip, it is most likely to be found at a location that is related to shopping. The options "atlantis" and "closet" are unlikely since they are not related to shopping. The option "retail store" is a possibility, but the sentence implies that the person left the bag behind when they left to eat, so they likely did not go to a retail store afterwards. This leaves "grocery store" and "restaurant" as the remaining options, but since the sentence mentions that they grabbed a bit to eat, it is more likely that the bag was left behind at the restaurant rather than the grocery store.
Answer:
restaurant
Question: She complained about the radio, what was it doing?
Options: A) radiotracking, B) turn on, C) train, D) blaring, E) play music,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the radio was too loud or making too much noise, since the person complained about it. The word "blaring" specifically means to make a loud, harsh, or unpleasant sound, which would fit with the idea of someone complaining about a radio. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, since they either suggest a different action the radio could be doing, or are not related to radio at all.
Answer:
blaring
Question: What does the government sometimes have too much of?
Options: A) canada, B) trouble, C) city, D) control, E) water,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the government can have an excess of something, and the word "sometimes" suggests that this is not always the case. The other choices, such as "Canada" and "water," do not make sense in this context. "Trouble" and "city" could be possible answers, but the word "sometimes" makes the choice of "control" more likely, as governments are often criticized for over-regulating or exerting too much control over their citizens.
Answer:
control
Question: When you drive and see someone walking across the street what do we do?
Options: A) reverse, B) stop, C) passenger, D) open the window, E) walking,
Knowledge: When encountering a pedestrian crossing the street while driving, it is important to stop the vehicle to allow them to cross safely. Driving in reverse may create more danger and is not a recommended action. The option for "passenger" is not related to the situation of encountering a pedestrian, and "open the window" and "walking" are also not relevant.
Answer:
stop
Question: Where could you find some plumbing that would not be of use to you if you are thirsty?
Options: A) oil refineries, B) wall, C) show, D) own home, E) water fountain,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the plumbing mentioned is not related to providing drinking water. Oil refineries have plumbing systems that are primarily used for processing crude oil and other materials, and are not used for providing drinking water. The other options (wall, shower, own home, water fountain) all contain plumbing systems that are used for bringing water to a tap or shower head, and therefore could potentially be used if someone was thirsty.

Options: A) headaches, B) sore throat, C) distraction, D) misunderstandings, E) cell phone,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people talking during the movie were causing a negative effect for others. Distraction is the most likely option because talking during a movie can be distracting for those trying to watch it. Headaches and sore throat are unlikely because they do not align with the context of the sentence. Misunderstandings and cell phone are also unlikely because they do not fit the context of the sentence either.
Answer:
distraction

Options: A) conference, B) livingroom, C) neighbor's house, D) white house, E) card room,
Knowledge: The question asks for the location of the closest dining table not in the person's home. The options "conference" and "card room" do not typically have dining tables, while the "living room" may have one but it would still be in the person's house. The "white house" is unrelated to the context of the question. The most likely option left is the "neighbor's house," as it suggests a location outside of the person's home where a dining table would be present.
Answer:
neighbor's house

Options: A) hollywood, B) night sky, C) constellation, D) atmosphere, E) solar system,
Knowledge: The context suggests that the star is lonely and wishing to be a part of something. It is most likely referring to a group or pattern of stars, which is what a constellation is.

The phrase "better knowledge" implies that the teacher is attempting to improve the students' understanding or increase their knowledge on a particular topic. The other options do not fit the context of a teacher trying to impart knowledge to their class. "Group students" and "time test" do not make sense in this context, and "suffering" and "state facts" do not imply the goal of teaching or sharing knowledge.

Options: A) batman, B) diluted, C) fragile, D) regular, E) weak,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is strong and morally upright, which makes it likely that they would want to protect someone who is weaker or in need of protection. The word "weak" directly contrasts with the idea of strength, and the other answer choices do not fit the context of the sentence. Batman is a fictional character and not relevant to the sentence, while "diluted," "fragile," and "regular" don't provide clear criteria for who needs protection.
Answer:

This can lead to greater success in negotiations and a more collaborative relationship overall. The other options (happiness, problems, confidence, comfortness) do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence, and are less likely to be a primary reason for learning a language for business.
Answer:

Additionally, the options expiration and perspiration do not make sense in the context of the question.
Answer:

Options: A) deck, B) stairwell, C) flight of stairs, D) feet, E) house,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the elderly person needs assistance pulling themselves up from a certain area in their home, which suggests that the area is not on the ground level. Stairwells are commonly found in homes with multiple levels and are a likely candidate for where an elderly person may need to install a railing for support. Decks and houses may also require railings for safety, but not necessarily for assistance in pulling oneself up. Feet is not a logical answer as it is a body part rather than an installation, and a flight of stairs is too vague and could refer to any set of stairs.
Answer:
stairwell

Options: A) ceiling, B) large building, C) warehouse, D) construction site, E) train station,
Knowledge: A beam is a structural element used in construction, typically made of wood or steel. It is often created on a construction site as part of the building process.

Large buildings and warehouses may have been built with beams, but they would not be created there.
Answer:
construction site

Relaxing, lying back and sleeping may be methods to lower blood pressure, but they may not be the specific instruction that John was given. Feeling happy is not necessarily related to blood pressure, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
Answer:
lower blood pressure

The other options (art class, indiana, insane asylum) do not have any clear connection to the use of a rubber stamp in an office setting. The word "desk" could potentially be a correct answer, as it is also associated with an office setting, but it is less likely than "office" as it is too specific and narrow in scope.
Answer:

The phrase "mostly couples" implies that the movie is something that both partners can enjoy together, rather than being solely focused on the preferences of one gender. The other options are all sexual in nature and do not fit the context of the sentence.

This helps them make a more informed decision based on their budget and the quality of the product they are interested in buying. "Spending of money" and "purchasing" are too general and could apply to any aspect of shopping, while "have fun" and "splurge" are more focused on the experience of shopping rather than the decision-making process.
Answer:
compare prices

Question: The grain-seller needed dry storage, where should he put it?
Options: A) pantry, B) storage closet, C) building, D) wet, E) warehouse,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the grain-seller required a place for storage that is dry, which leads to the conclusion that the correct answer should be something different from "wet". While "pantry" and "storage closet" are both possible options for dry storage, the word "building" is too broad and does not specifically suggest a dry storage environment. Therefore, "warehouse" is the most appropriate answer as it implies a large, enclosed storage area that can protect the grains from moisture while allowing for easier access and organization.
Answer:
warehouse

The word "just" indicates that he believes the punishment would be unfair or unjust.

"Press conference" is completely unrelated to astronomy.
Answer:
globular cluster

Options: A) making more money, B) disputes, C) more work, D) more responsibility, E) higher taxes,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer is gaining more land, which implies that they will have more space to grow crops or raise livestock. This would allow them to produce more and potentially increase their profits, leading to the expected positive consequence of making more money.

Options: A) eyes, B) litter of kittens, C) four legs, D) nose, E) flippers,

This allows them to see in the dark much better than humans can. Therefore, the most likely feature of a cat that can be seen in the dark would be their eyes. The other options, such as litter of kittens, four legs, nose, and flippers do not have any clear connection to the characteristics of cats that would be visible in the dark.
Answer:

Options: A) recreational vehicle, B) clothes cupboard, C) house, D) mansion, E) bedroom,
Knowledge: A "walk-in type wardrobe" generally refers to a large, separate closet area that one can walk into and browse clothing racks and shelves. This type of wardrobe is more commonly found in larger homes or mansions, where space is not as much of an issue.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe was keeping his school books in a place where he could easily access them when he wanted to study, which implies that the location was in his home. The options "cabinet," "school building," "bank," and "bookstore" do not fit this context, as they are all separate places from Joe's home. Therefore, the most probable location where Joe's shelf would be placed is his bedroom.
Answer:
bedroom

Options: A) run away, B) get somewhere, C) falling down, D) accident, E) pleasure,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man was in a hurry, which suggests that he had a destination or goal in mind. The options "run away" and "accident" both suggest negative circumstances, which do not fit the context of the sentence. "Pleasure" is unlikely because the sentence does not suggest that the man was enjoying himself, and "falling down" is not a logical consequence of riding a bike quickly. Therefore, "get somewhere" is the most reasonable choice.
Answer:
get somewhere

The other options, such as class, war, and opera, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are therefore unlikely to be correct answers. The meaning of life may seem like a plausible option, but it is not directly related to the mental patient's confusion in the sentence.
Answer:

Answer:
offices
Question: Mildew is a type of fungus you most often find where?
Options: A) toenails, B) shower stall, C) mushroom, D) cave, E) basement,
Knowledge: Mildew is a type of fungus that grows in damp environments. A shower stall is an area of the bathroom that is often damp and humid, which makes it a prime location for mildew growth. Toenails, mushrooms, cave, and basement do not have the necessary moisture and humidity that mildew requires to grow, so they are less likely to be a common location for mildew.
Answer:
shower stall
Question: Following a killing, what are the police likely to begin?
Options: A) man hunt, B) punishment, C) going to jail, D) retribution, E) investigation,
Knowledge: The word "following" suggests that the police are starting a process after a crime has been committed. Since the question is asking what the police are "likely to begin," it suggests that the answer is the first step in the process of addressing the crime. "Man hunt," "punishment," "going to jail," and "retribution" are all steps that may happen after the police have completed their investigation, while "investigation" is the logical first step in understanding the circumstances of the crime.
Answer:
investigation
Question: What can a child do to quietly pass the time?
Options: A) brood, B) read book, C) become adult, D) ask questions, E) clean room,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child needs to pass the time quietly, which implies an activity that is not particularly active or noisy. The option "read book" fits this description, as it is a quiet and solitary activity that can keep a child occupied for long periods of time. The other options do not fit this description - "brood" implies a negative and introspective state of mind, "become adult" is not an activity but a gradual process of growing up, "ask questions" may require interaction with others and therefore may not be quiet, and "clean room" may require physical activity and make some noise.
Answer:
read book
Question: They wanted to go on a road trip, they picked each highway to take them on their way across where?
Options: A) atlas, B) countryside, C) united states, D) between to cities, E) repairs,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individuals are planning a road trip that will take them across a country or region. The option "united states" is the most fitting choice as it is a well-known country with a vast network of highways that can take travelers across the entire nation. The other options do not provide a clear indication of where the road trip is taking place or which highways will be used.
Answer:
united states
Question: Though its intentions are for the people, freedom often finds itself cast aside under many historical examples of what?
Options: A) slavery, B) communism, C) evil, D) captivity, E) good,
Knowledge: The word "cast aside" suggests that the context is negative or detrimental to freedom. Slavery and captivity are both forms of oppression and are more directly related to the restriction of freedom rather than its cast-aside nature. "Evil" and "good" are too vague to be a clear answer. Communism is historically associated with oppressive regimes that prioritize the state over the individual, which can lead to restrictions on personal freedoms.
Answer:
communism
Question: The religious man was explaining that his faith was something that only he could what?
Options: A) dream, B) light way, C) belief, D) trust, E) experience,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the religious man is talking about his personal relationship with faith, indicating that it is something that he has gone through or felt, rather than just believed in intellectually. The use of the word "only" also implies that this is something unique to the individual, not something that can be shared or taught. "Dream" and "light way" do not have a clear connection to the concept of faith, and "belief" and "trust" suggest a more intellectual or abstract understanding of faith rather than a personal experience of it.
Answer:
experience
Question: The blood was everywhere in the operating room, what were the surgeons operating on?
Options: A) soccer game, B) musle, C) vein, D) animals, E) person,
Knowledge: The context of this sentence suggests that the surgeons were performing an operation in a medical setting, as blood is commonly associated with surgical procedures. The option "person" is the most likely answer, as surgeries are typically done on human patients. The other options have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
person
Question: A cat is a carnivore which means they don't do what?
Options: A) get wet, B) wool sweater, C) eat vegetables, D) hunt prey, E) sharp claws,
Knowledge: The sentence states that a cat is a carnivore, which means that they primarily eat meat. This knowledge helps eliminate the choices "get wet," "wool sweater," and "sharp claws" as they are not related to the diet of a cat. The correct choice is "eat vegetables" as it directly contradicts with the fact that a cat is a carnivore since they do not eat vegetables. The final option, "hunt prey," is not the correct answer as it is actually a behavior that is associated with being a carnivore.
Answer:
eat vegetables
Question: I am looking for a gift for someone I barely know, where do I look?
Options: A) specialty store, B) christmas tree, C) lost and found, D) department store, E) party,
Knowledge: A department store typically offers a wide range of products including clothing, accessories, home decor, and electronics, making it a good option for finding a gift for someone you barely know. Specialty stores usually focus on a specific type of product or theme, which may not necessarily be what the person is interested in. A Christmas tree and lost and found have no relevance to finding a gift, and a party may not necessarily have any options for a gift.
Answer:
department store
Question: The membrane could be observed through magnification, it protected the what?
Options: A) protect, B) cell, C) filtration, D) animal, E) fresh egg,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the membrane being referred to is a cell membrane. Cell membranes are often observed through magnification as they are too small to be seen with the naked eye. The membrane serves to protect the cell and regulate the entry and exit of substances, which is why it is a crucial component of a cell. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
cell

Answer:
being single
Question: Where would you get a keyboard if you do not have one?
Options: A) office, B) music store, C) school, D) classifieds, E) landfill,
Knowledge: A keyboard is a musical instrument, so it would make sense to look for one at a music store. An office or school would not typically have musical instruments available. The classifieds or online marketplaces may have used or secondhand keyboards available, but a music store would be the most reliable option for purchasing a new keyboard. A landfill would not be a place to acquire a keyboard.
Answer:
music store
Question: Where would you go if you wanted to buy clothes as well as other things?
Options: A) house, B) closet, C) beach, D) clothing store, E) mall,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place where they can buy clothes as well as other things, which is a characteristic commonly associated with malls.

The most likely place for this hub to be located is the main office, as this is where the majority of a company's administrative and managerial functions are typically carried out. The other options, such as a beach or basement, are unlikely locations for a master control hub.
Answer:

Options: A) passing out, B) fist, C) breaking, D) ticket, E) alcoholism,

Therefore, if a person spends a lot of time "hitting the bottle" it can be inferred that they may have a problem with alcohol consumption, which is a characteristic associated with alcoholism. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the phrase and are not related to excessive drinking.
Answer:

Answer:
shameful

Knowledge: Pregnancy is often associated with weight gain and fatigue, which could cause someone to go to bed early. Additionally, hormonal changes can stimulate appetite and lead to increased calorie intake. The other options are less likely to cause weight gain and early bedtime. Drowsiness and sleeping in could be signs of fatigue, but do not necessarily lead to weight gain. Insomnia typically causes sleeplessness, not earlier bedtimes. Exercise may lead to weight loss and improved sleep patterns.
Answer:
pregnancy

The only way for the victim to gain something seems to be by killing someone, which implies that the kidnapper is offering them a way to escape or gain their freedom. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the concept of someone being held captive or needing to kill someone to gain something.

Options: A) inspiration, B) drowsiness, C) getting bored, D) gain knowledge, E) gaining knowledge,

Options: A) definitely, B) weak, C) weakness, D) wont, E) will,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boy had a flaw or vulnerability that the villain was able to use against him, which points to the correct answer being "weakness".

Answer:
weakness

The other choices, such as "fire," "garage," or "contain food," do not make sense in this context.
Answer:

Options: A) school building, B) corner, C) outside, D) wall, E) cabinet,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the irregular shape of the shelf could potentially be a hazard in high-traffic areas. This implies that the shelf should be placed in a location where it is less likely to be bumped into or obstruct the flow of foot traffic.

Knowledge: The sentence implies that Alexa needs money to obtain food since she left her wallet at home. John gives her a twenty-dollar bill to enable her to purchase food, which is the most likely option among the choices provided. The other options, such as borrowing, having, or preparing food, suggest alternative ways of obtaining food that do not require money.

Options: A) dancing about, B) being happy, C) snapped fiddle string., D) square dancing, E) discovery,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Jamie had never played an instrument before and that starting to fiddle was an exciting thing for her. This suggests that the answer is related to the experience of discovering something new. Dancing, being happy, and square dancing are not directly related to the context in the sentence. A snapped fiddle string may have been frustrating or disappointing, but it does not fit the description of something that Jamie found thrilling.
Answer:
discovery
Question: Where would you put a ticket?
Options: A) amusement park, B) movie, C) train station, D) baseball stadium, E) person's hand,
Knowledge: The options suggest different places where tickets might be used, and the most common place to put a ticket would be in a person's hand to show proof of admission or purchase. At an amusement park, movie theater, train station, or baseball stadium, a ticket may be required to enter or access certain areas. However, simply having a ticket does not guarantee entry without it being presented to an attendant or scanned. Therefore, the correct answer would be a person's hand where the ticket can be easily accessed and presented when needed.
Answer:
person's hand

Options: A) juice bar, B) bar, C) cabinet, D) store, E) cupboard,
Knowledge: In most cases, alcohol is served in a mug at a bar, which is a place that specializes in serving alcoholic beverages. A juice bar typically only serves non-alcoholic drinks, and a store or cupboard would not be a typical location for serving alcohol. A cabinet may refer to a type of furniture or storage unit, but it is not a location where one would typically be served alcohol.
Answer:
bar

Options: A) use glass, B) open mouth, C) eat first, D) buy alcohol, E) coffee mug,
Knowledge: Using a glass is a common way to drink something politely or formally. Glassware is often used in formal settings, such as at weddings or fancy dinners. The other options do not make sense in the context of drinking politely or formally - opening your mouth is not an appropriate vessel, eating first is unrelated, buying alcohol is irrelevant if the question is about drinking politely, and a coffee mug is not generally used in formal settings.
Answer:
use glass

Answer:

Options: A) knives, B) shoulder, C) giblets, D) guillotine, E) bottle,
Knowledge: The context of the question refers to the French Revolution, a turbulent time in French history characterized by radical political and social upheaval. The use of the term "cut through royal necks" suggests a violent and deadly approach to punishing those in power. The guillotine was famously used during the French Revolution to execute thousands of individuals, including King Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette. The other options do not align with the context of the question or historical knowledge of the French Revolution.
Answer:
guillotine
Question: The student was having difficulty finding information in the book, so he raise his hand and began to what?
Options: A) learn, B) turn pages, C) death, D) ask questions, E) go to school,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the student was experiencing difficulty with finding information in the book, which implies that they are seeking help or clarification. In an academic setting, it is common for students to raise their hand and ask questions when they do not fully understand a concept or are struggling with a task. This makes "ask questions" the most logical answer choice. "Learn" is not a specific action that serves to address the student's problem, "turn pages" is not necessarily helpful in finding specific information, "death" is completely irrelevant to the context, and "go to school" is too general and doesn't address the specific issue.
Answer:
ask questions
Question: James and Ruth were getting a divorce.  It was amicable, but it wasn't happy.  There was a lot of what emotion?
Options: A) bitterness, B) sadness, C) depression, D) pain, E) anguish,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while James and Ruth's divorce was not acrimonious, it was still a difficult and emotional experience. The use of the word "amicable" implies that there was not a lot of bitterness or anger involved, but the description of the situation as "not happy" suggests that both parties were likely feeling sad or upset about the end of their marriage. The other options may also be applicable to a divorce, but do not fit as well with the specific language used in the sentence.
Answer:
sadness

Question: Where might a person go if they need urgent care for a wound?
Options: A) body, B) injury, C) patient, D) emergency room, E) hospital,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a wound that requires urgent care. Urgent care is a medical treatment that requires immediate attention, which would logically lead an individual to go to the emergency room. The hospital option is a vague option as different hospitals have different departments and services. Body and patient are not locations and injury does not provide any clear direction as to where to go.
Answer:
emergency room
Question: He really enjoyed the restaurant, when he got home he gave it what?
Options: A) own house, B) loyal friends, C) fever, D) good review, E) with cat,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person had a positive experience at the restaurant, and upon returning home, he did something to express his satisfaction. The most common way to do this is by leaving a good review on a website, such as Yelp or Google Reviews. The other options, such as owning a house or having loyal friends, do not make sense in this context and are unrelated to the experience at the restaurant. Fever and with cat do not fit the situation at all.
Answer:
good review
Question: Greg couldn't pay the cash advance fee, and thus was dinged for what?
Options: A) late payment, B) going backward, C) retreat, D) late payment, E) basic,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Greg incurred some sort of penalty or fee related to his inability to pay a cash advance fee. The phrase "dinged for" implies that this penalty was negative or costly. Based on the available choices, the most likely penalty for failure to pay a fee would be a late payment fee, as this is a common penalty for missed or overdue payments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
late payment
Question: If you started killing people for no reason, what are you likely to lack?
Options: A) prison sentence, B) going to jail, C) feelings of guilt, D) die, E) hunger,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a moral or ethical reason why killing people is wrong, and suggests that the person who is doing the killing may not feel guilty or remorseful about it. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "feelings of guilt." The other options (prison sentence, going to jail, die, hunger) are consequences that may result from the action of killing people, but they do not explain why the person is doing it in the first place.
Answer:
feelings of guilt
Question: What could happen after relaxing for a long time by not doing anything?
Options: A) shut eyes, B) falling asleep, C) listening to music, D) reading, E) shut eyes,
Knowledge: The sentence uses the word "relaxing" and "not doing anything" together, which suggests a state of relaxation that could lead to sleepiness. The option "shut eyes" is not a plausible answer as it is only a description of a physical action that could happen during relaxation, rather than an outcome. "Listening to music" and "reading" may also be relaxing activities, but they do not necessarily lead to falling asleep. Therefore, "falling asleep" is the correct answer.
Answer:
falling asleep
Question: If a beautiful person sprays you with a hose what will you be?
Options: A) wet, B) cold, C) dull, D) bad, E) rainy,
Knowledge: The question mentions someone spraying another person with a hose. This action commonly results in someone becoming wet, as the water from the hose will soak their clothing and skin. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.

Options: A) heart, B) restaurant, C) table, D) shelf, E) stomach,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the smell of the food made Joe feel a physical reaction in his body. The most logical body part likely to experience such a reaction is his stomach, as it is directly related to the ingestion and digestion of food. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
stomach
Question: Stress can affect your mood, sometimes even leading to what?
Options: A) headache, B) high blood pressure, C) fatigue, D) depression, E) heart attacks,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that stress can have a negative impact on a person's mood, and can sometimes lead to a more serious mental health issue such as depression. While stress can manifest in physical symptoms like headaches and high blood pressure, the word "mood" implies a more emotional response. Depression is a common condition associated with prolonged stress, and can have a debilitating impact on a person's mental and physical wellbeing. Fatigue can also be a consequence of stress, but it is not specifically linked to mood changes in the sentence. Heart attacks are a more extreme outcome of high blood pressure, which is not always a direct result of stress.
Answer:
depression
Question: All humans store urine in what organ?
Options: A) feelings, B) names, C) naval, D) bladders, E) bladders,
Knowledge: The sentence is discussing human anatomy and specifically refers to the storage of urine. The bladder is the organ responsible for storing urine before it is eliminated from the body. The other options, such as feelings, names, and naval, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and are not related to human anatomy. Additionally, "bladders" is repeated twice in the list of choices, so it is the only logical option to choose.
Answer:
bladders
Question: Where do people go to pray?
Options: A) go to church, B) kneel, C) ground, D) ignorance, E) speak to god,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where people go to pray, which is commonly associated with religious practices. Going to church is a common practice among many religious faiths, where people gather to worship and pray together. Kneeling is a common physical posture while praying, but it doesn't answer the question about where people go to pray. Ground and ignorance have no clear connection to the context of the question, and while speaking to God can be done anywhere, the question is specifically asking for a location.
Answer:
go to church
Question: Where in a building would you play a board game?
Options: A) shelf, B) cupboard, C) shower, D) house, E) den,
Knowledge: A den is typically a comfortable room in a house that is used for leisure activities such as watching TV, reading, or playing games. Board games are commonly played in dens, as they provide a relaxed and social environment for players. A shelf or cupboard may be used to store board games, but they are not typically played on these surfaces. A shower is not an appropriate place to play board games as it is a wet area designed for personal hygiene. "House" is too general and does not provide any contextual clues relevant to the question.
Answer:
den
Question: They were surprised that he enjoy rap, but he explained that every genre has what?
Options: A) classical, B) country music, C) hip hop, D) rock, E) good music,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being discussed enjoys rap music, which may surprise those around them. However, the person justifies their enjoyment of the genre by suggesting that every genre has good music within it. This implies that the person believes that there is no inherently bad genre of music, but rather that it is a matter of personal taste. The answer choice "good music" reflects this reasoning, while the other options are specific genres that do not necessarily relate to the argument being made.
Answer:
good music

Question: Where is the most plumbing in a house likely to be found?
Options: A) oil refineries, B) underground, C) wall, D) kitchen, E) bathroom,
Knowledge: Plumbing refers to the system of pipes and fixtures that bring water into a building and remove waste water. The bathroom is the room in a house where the majority of plumbing fixtures are located, such as sinks, toilets, and showers/bathtubs. While it is possible to have plumbing in a kitchen as well, it is typically a smaller amount and not as complex as the plumbing in a bathroom. Oil refineries and underground locations have no relevance to the context, and while plumbing may be located in walls, this is not the most likely location for it to be found in a house.
Answer:
bathroom

Options: A) hardware store, B) old clock, C) broom closet, D) puzzle, E) old houses,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wooden rod was part of a chime, which is a component commonly found in antique clocks.

Answer:
old clock

Options: A) museum, B) outside, C) bad movie, D) sea world, E) marine museum,
Knowledge: The question suggests that the rubber shark is being portrayed as a villain, which is a common trope in bad movies. Movies often create unrealistic or exaggerated characters to dramatize the plot and create suspense, which may explain why a rubber shark was chosen as a villain. The other options, such as a museum or sea world, do not necessarily have any connection to a rubber shark being portrayed as a villain.
Answer:
bad movie
Question: He said he also wanted in, he threatened to tattle what?
Options: A) differently, B) mere, C) only, D) otherwise, E) anyway,
Knowledge: The word "tattle" suggests that someone is threatening to reveal or report something. In this context, the person is threatening to do so if they don't get what they want. The word "also" suggests that this person wants something in addition to what they already have or are entitled to. The word "otherwise" indicates a contrast between two possibilities, which fits with the idea of the person wanting something different or else they will tattle. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
otherwise
Question: Where are horses found in fields?
Options: A) field, B) kept in barn stalls, C) race track, D) countryside, E) fair,
Knowledge: Horses are commonly found in fields in rural areas or the countryside where there is plenty of open space for grazing and exercise. Keeping horses in barn stalls or on a race track is not ideal as they need space to move around freely. Fairs are also not a typical place to find horses in fields.
Answer:
countryside
Question: What type of building is a bank?
Options: A) main street, B) secure place, C) pool of currency, D) financial center, E) grocery store,
Knowledge: Banks are typically considered to be financial centers because they handle financial transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, loans, and investments. The other options do not accurately describe the purpose or function of a bank. "Main street" and "grocery store" describe the location or physical appearance of a building, while "secure place" and "pool of currency" are general descriptions that could apply to many different types of buildings.
Answer:
financial center
Question: If I can feel material, then where am I generally speaking?
Options: A) fabric store, B) anything, C) attic, D) physical world, E) science lab,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that feeling a material is a sensory experience that occurs in a physical environment. The options "fabric store" and "attic" may be physical locations, but they do not necessarily imply that the person is in a physical context related to touching materials. "Anything" is too vague and does not provide any context for understanding the sentence. "Science lab" implies an artificial environment rather than a natural, physical one. Therefore, the correct answer is "physical world."
Answer:
physical world
Question: Where would you find food packaged in MRE's?
Options: A) fairgrounds, B) picnic, C) neighbor's house, D) supermarket, E) military base,
Knowledge: MRE stands for "Meal, Ready-to-Eat" and is a type of food ration used by military personnel in the field.

Options: A) office building, B) house, C) hotel, D) school, E) a chair,
Knowledge: The sentence describes Jill walking to a cubicle, which is typically found in an office building. The other options, such as a house or hotel, do not typically have cubicles. Additionally, the mention of a floor number suggests a multi-level building, which further supports the answer of an office building. The option of a chair is illogical as it does not indicate a location.
Answer:
office building
Question: What is a heat source that can be obtained for free?
Options: A) bedroom, B) fire, C) car, D) solar energy, E) gasoline,
Knowledge: The question asks for a heat source that can be obtained for free, which eliminates options like gasoline and a car. A bedroom is not a heat source, and fire may not always be free depending on the availability of wood or other fuels. Solar energy is a renewable and sustainable source of heat that can be harvested using solar panels, making it the correct answer.
Answer:
solar energy

Options: A) car, B) bus stop, C) subway, D) skateboard, E) airport,
Knowledge: In order to travel from Atlanta to Hong Kong, the most common mode of transportation would be by plane, and the departure point would be an airport. The other options, such as a car or skateboard, would not be practical for traveling such a long distance across an ocean. A bus stop or subway may be used to get to the airport, but they are not the primary mode of transportation for the long journey to Hong Kong.
Answer:
airport
Question: Doctors gave sedative to the patient complaining of pain, what did he say afterwards?
Options: A) enjoyment, B) good sometimes, C) immobilize, D) feels good, E) good feeling,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the sedative had a positive effect on the patient's pain, which is likely to have caused them to feel better. The other options do not accurately reflect the likely outcome of the sedative, which is to reduce pain and help the patient feel more comfortable. Additionally, the option "immobilize" does not make sense in the context of a sedative for pain relief.
Answer:
feels good
Question: Where could you buy an old pie safe with decorative tin?
Options: A) shopping bag, B) trash, C) antique store, D) landfill, E) cupboard,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the speaker is looking for a specific item, an old pie safe with decorative tin. An antique store is a place where one would typically find such an item. The other options, a shopping bag, trash, landfill, and cupboard, do not make sense in this context.
Answer:
antique store
Question: Where would you buy an icebox built a hundred years ago?
Options: A) kitchen, B) antique store, C) junk yard, D) walmart, E) homes,
Knowledge: An icebox built a hundred years ago is considered an antique item, which means it is likely to be sold in an antique store rather than in a regular store or a junkyard. While it is possible that some people may still have an icebox in their homes, it is unlikely that it would be a hundred years old, and it wouldn't be sold in a kitchen or a Walmart.
Answer:
antique store

Options: A) warehouse, B) bridge, C) metal shop, D) shop, E) new construction,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question used a beam to create a temporary structure over a flooded gap. The most logical choice for what he created would be a bridge. The other options, such as warehouse or metal shop, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Shop and new construction are too vague to be the correct choice.
Answer:
bridge
Question: In what environment would you expect to find a shark?
Options: A) sea world, B) deep ocean, C) maritime museum, D) pet store, E) great barrier reef,
Knowledge: Sharks are typically found in the open ocean, particularly in deeper waters away from shore. The deep ocean provides a suitable environment for many species of sharks, such as the great white, tiger, and hammerhead sharks. Sea World and maritime museums may have sharks on display, but they are generally not found in these environments naturally. Pet stores would not typically carry sharks, and the Great Barrier Reef is a coral reef ecosystem, not a location commonly associated with sharks, although some species can be found there.
Answer:
deep ocean
Question: If a person accidentally harms another person, what happens to them?
Options: A) live happily, B) work at home, C) catch cold, D) feel ashamed, E) throw a party,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person has accidentally caused harm to another person, which would likely result in feelings of guilt and shame. None of the other answer choices would make sense in this context, as they do not relate to the consequences of accidentally causing harm to someone else.
Answer:
feel ashamed
Question: There are hundreds of bars and eateries in what east coast metropolis?
Options: A) jail, B) michigan, C) nightclub, D) new york city, E) restaurant,
Knowledge: The question refers to a large city on the east coast, which narrows down the options to a handful of choices. The options "jail" and "michigan" are unlikely choices for a question about bars and eateries, and "nightclub" and "restaurant" could refer to many cities. However, "new york city" is known for its vast array of bars and restaurants, making it the most likely answer.
Answer:
new york city
Question: What do you do to get ready to compete in body building?
Options: A) smart, B) sign up, C) train, D) good at, E) start,
Knowledge: Body building is a sport that requires intense physical training and conditioning. Therefore, the answer that best fits the context of the question is "train". This is because preparing to compete in body building involves practicing and perfecting various exercises and techniques to build muscle mass and achieve a defined physique. The other options do not reflect the necessary physical preparation required for body building, such as being "smart" or simply "signing up".
Answer:
train
Question: She was not lying intentionally, but she had a powerful what?
Options: A) duplicitous, B) dishonesty, C) poker face, D) imagination, E) deceitful,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question did not intentionally lie, but still had a powerful quality that could have caused confusion or misunderstanding. The word "imagination" would fit this description, as it suggests that the person may have inadvertently created a false narrative or perception of events due to their creative thinking. The other options all describe deliberate acts of deception or concealment, which do not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
imagination
Question: What must someone purchase if they plan on going to a play?
Options: A) tickets, B) having ticket, C) patience, D) time, E) a hat,
Knowledge: Going to a play requires a ticket to enter the theater and watch the performance. Without a ticket, one would not be allowed to enter the theater. Patience and time may be required for waiting in line or for the play to start, but they are not necessary to purchase. Having a ticket would make sense grammatically, but it is not a commonly used phrase. A hat also does not have any connection to going to a play.
Answer:
tickets

Options: A) starving, B) heartburn, C) gas, D) overeating, E) being satisfied,

Answer:

Question: I was creating art, what would be my end product?
Options: A) controversy, B) communication, C) feeling of accomplishment, D) strong emotion, E) work of art,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker was engaged in the act of creating art, and therefore the end product would likely be a work of art. The other options are either outcomes that could result from creating art or subjective experiences that the creator might have while making art, but they are not the actual end product of the creative process. The end product of creating art is usually a tangible object, such as a painting, sculpture, or photograph.
Answer:
work of art
Question: Cats always tickle me with their?
Options: A) purring, B) four paws, C) four legs, D) two eyes, E) whiskers,
Knowledge: The word "tickling" in the sentence suggests a playful or lighthearted interaction. Cats are known for using their whiskers to explore and interact with their environment, which can be playful and ticklish for their human companions. The other options - purring, four paws, four legs, and two eyes - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
whiskers
Question: What do all people have at first but later might not have?
Options: A) mentality, B) feelings, C) muscles, D) brains, E) parents,
Knowledge: The question is asking about something that all people have at first but might not have later in life. The option that fits this criterion is 'parents.' All individuals have parents at birth, but some may lose them due to various reasons such as separation, divorce, or death. The other options such as mentality, feelings, muscles, and brains are not things that people typically lose over time.
Answer:
parents
Question: When experiencing loneliness who would be a good person to see?
Options: A) socialize, B) meet friend, C) make people laugh, D) make friends, E) get fight,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the solution to loneliness involves spending time with someone else. Out of the options, "meet friend" is the best choice as it specifically mentions seeing someone who you already consider a friend. "Socialize" and "make friends" are possible ways to alleviate loneliness, but in this context, they are not as direct as meeting up with someone you already know. "Make people laugh" and "get fight" are unlikely solutions to loneliness and are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
meet friend
Question: When getting in shape you need to have this in between workouts?
Options: A) give up, B) eat more, C) period of recovery, D) dance, E) jogging,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to get in shape, something is needed in between workouts. This could refer to the fact that the body needs time to rest and recover in order to build muscle and improve fitness. The option "give up" contradicts this idea, while "eat more" may be counterproductive to weight loss goals. "Dance" and "jogging" may be types of workouts, but they do not directly address the need for a period of recovery. Therefore, "period of recovery" is the most appropriate answer.
Answer:
period of recovery
Question: Why do people like getting wet in the summer?
Options: A) get cold, B) relax, C) catching cold, D) catch cold, E) cooling off,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people enjoy getting wet during the summer season. One possible reason for this is to cool off, as water has a cooling effect on the body. The option "get cold" may be the opposite of what people want during a hot summer day. "Relax" could be a possible reason for getting wet, but it does not necessarily explain why people specifically like getting wet in the summer. "Catching cold" and "catch cold" are essentially the same option and do not make sense in this context as they imply getting sick rather than cooling off.
Answer:
cooling off
Question: Where would you get an eyeglasses case if you do not have one?
Options: A) factory, B) bag, C) store, D) purse, E) shirt pocket,
Knowledge: The question implies that the person needs to acquire an eyeglasses case, which suggests they do not currently have one. A store is a logical place to look for an eyeglasses case as it is a commonly sold item in stores that sell eyeglasses or accessories. The other options do not seem to be as relevant in this context, as a factory or bag would not necessarily have an eyeglasses case readily available, a purse may or may not be large enough to hold an eyeglasses case, and a shirt pocket may not be a secure or protective enough option for an eyeglasses case.
Answer:
store
Question: Sweet is a great taste on its own, but it also goes great with what?
Options: A) bitter, B) salty, C) dry, D) sour, E) savory,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that sweet has a complementary taste that goes well with another taste. One common pairing is sweet and sour, as found in many dishes like sweet and sour chicken or sweet and sour sauce. The other options do not have a strong association with sweetness in terms of taste pairing. For example, bitter and sweet are often opposite tastes, while salty and dry do not create a pleasing contrast with sweetness.
Answer:
sour
Question: Noise takes the form of static in a radio what?
Options: A) classroom, B) transmission, C) movie theatre, D) car, E) bowling alley,

Options: A) comfortable position, B) floor, C) residential area, D) family room, E) upside down,
Knowledge: Cats are known for their love of sleep, and they often seek out comfortable positions to rest in. This is a common behavior among cats, as they are known to gravitate towards soft, warm spots in order to rest and relax. The other options, such as the floor, residential area, family room, or upside down, are not necessarily related to the context of the sentence, and do not provide any clear indication of how a cat might lay down to sleep.
Answer:
comfortable position
Question: Where are you if a cow you've raised gets an award?
Options: A) county fair, B) stable, C) barnyard, D) sheepfold, E) farmyard,
Knowledge: The question implies that the cow getting an award is a significant event, which suggests that it is likely taking place at some kind of competition or exhibition. A county fair is a common event where livestock are showcased and judged, so it is the most likely answer. The other options, such as stable, barnyard, sheepfold, and farmyard, are locations where cows may be kept or raised, but they do not have the same association with awards or competitions.
Answer:
county fair
Question: James found two abandoned garbage cans behind an old building.  Where might they have been concealed?
Options: A) driveway, B) alley, C) garage, D) street, E) own backyard,
Knowledge: The word "abandoned" suggests that the garbage cans were left in a hidden or obscure place, rather than in a more obvious location like a driveway, garage, or street. The options "alley" and "own backyard" have a stronger association with places where items might be hidden or left out of sight.
Answer:
alley
Question: Where can you put leftover soup?
Options: A) toilet mug, B) cupboard, C) container, D) supermarket, E) jar,
Knowledge: The question asks for a suitable place to store leftover soup, which suggests that the correct answer needs to be a container or receptacle of some sort. A toilet mug or supermarket are clearly inappropriate options, and a jar may not be large enough to hold the soup. A cupboard is a possible option, but it does not provide an airtight seal and may not keep the soup fresh for very long. Therefore, a container is the most logical and practical choice.
Answer:
container
Question: Where might you use a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves?
Options: A) loading dock, B) construction site, C) supermarket, D) construction yard, E) warehouse,
Knowledge: Forklifts are commonly used in warehouses to move heavy loads and stack them onto shelves for storage. The other options do not typically involve the need for a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves. A loading dock may involve the use of a forklift to unload or load trucks, but not necessarily to stack boxes. A construction site and yard may use different types of machinery for heavy lifting, but not typically a forklift. A supermarket would not usually require the use of a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves.
Answer:
warehouse
Question: Where would you find a cottage that gets flooded often?
Options: A) desert, B) painting, C) fairy story, D) mountains, E) rural area,
Knowledge: The word "cottage" suggests a small, cozy dwelling commonly found in rural areas. The phrase "gets flooded often" implies that the area in question is prone to flooding, which is more likely to happen in rural areas with bodies of water nearby, such as rivers or lakes. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
rural area
Question: In the battle they would fight enemy, their only goal was ultimate what?
Options: A) victory, B) get hurt, C) be killed, D) death, E) dying,

Answer:
victory

Options: A) dim, B) inaccurate, C) above board, D) blunt, E) flat,

Answer:

Question: What does living life too hard lead to?
Options: A) over age, B) early death, C) valuable, D) joy, E) happiness,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that living life too hard has negative consequences. "Early death" is a logical choice because excessive stress, unhealthy behaviors, and reckless decision-making can all contribute to premature mortality. "Over age," "valuable," "joy," and "happiness" do not fit the context and imply a positive outcome, which is not supported by the sentence.
Answer:
early death
Question: What is the ping sent from a spam blog called?
Options: A) ham, B) splurp, C) sping, D) splog, E) blam,
Knowledge: The word "ping" in the question refers to a message sent from one computer to another to check if the second computer is online and available.

Of the options given, only "sping" (a combination of "spam" and "ping") fits this description. The other options are not related to spam blogs or online messaging.
Answer:
sping

Options: A) mars, B) wisconsin, C) waterfall, D) mountainous area, E) planet earth,
Knowledge: Rivers with flowing water are a common feature on planet Earth. While there may be other celestial bodies that feature rivers or similar water formations, the context of the question strongly implies that the answer is related to a planet that humans are familiar with, and Earth is the only option that fits that criteria. The other options are either not planets, or there is no clear connection to flowing water.
Answer:
planet earth
Question: Where can you buy material for making a pillow?

Knowledge: The context of the question is related to buying materials for a specific item, which is a pillow. A fabric store typically sells various types of fabrics, including those suitable for pillow-making, such as cotton, linen, and silk. The other options, such as construction, toy store, and factory, are not commonly associated with selling fabrics for crafts or home decor. House is also not a viable option as it is an improper noun and does not refer to a specific store or shop.
Answer:
fabric store

Answer:
apartment complex

Options: A) find truth, B) see particular program, C) go to market, D) attend school, E) pizza,
Knowledge: The question suggests that the person wants to satisfy their curiosity, which can only be achieved by finding answers or the truth to their questions. The other options, such as seeing a particular program, going to the market, attending school or eating pizza, do not necessarily address the person's curiosity directly. They may provide temporary pleasure or entertainment, but they do not offer a satisfactory solution to one's curiosity.
Answer:
find truth

Knowledge: Opera glasses are typically associated with traditional or classical music events, such as operas, and are often used by individuals who want to get a closer view of the performers on stage. Given that the question is asking for old opera glasses, it's reasonable to assume that they may be looking for a vintage or antique pair. Antique stores often sell old and unique items, including rare or vintage opera glasses. The other options do not seem likely to offer old opera glasses.
Answer:
antique store

Options: A) ill, B) tangential, C) reverse, D) uncommon, E) unconventional,

Options: A) no legs, B) they're stupid, C) scales, D) gills, E) bones,

Options: A) get food, B) prepare food, C) have food, D) buy food, E) need food,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason why John can't eat lunch is that he does not have any food available to him at the moment.

Options: A) cage, B) sky, C) on the head of a man, D) roof, E) countryside,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bird was flying before it got tired and needed to land. Out of all the options, roof is the most likely place for a bird to land after flying, as it is a high point and provides a good vantage point for the bird to rest and observe its surroundings. The other options, such as cage, sky, or on the head of a man, are less likely to be the answer because they don't fit the logical progression of the sentence.
Answer:
roof

Answer:
dude ranch
Question: If the captain of a crew was going to an arena, what type of crew would he be in?
Options: A) battleship, B) airplane cabin, C) military, D) basketball team, E) solider,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the captain is going to an arena, which suggests that they are part of a team that plays in a sports competition. The options battleship, airplane cabin, and military do not involve sports, so they can be eliminated. The option soldier could be a possibility, but the context of the sentence does not mention anything about war, combat or the military, which rules out that option as well. Therefore, the correct answer is basketball team.
Answer:
basketball team
Question: Where will you find wheat planted?
Options: A) bread, B) countryside, C) the forest, D) mill, E) farmer's field,
Knowledge: Wheat is a type of crop that is typically grown in open fields, particularly in rural areas where agriculture is common. The other choices, such as bread or mill, are more related to the processing and consumption of wheat rather than its cultivation. Forests are not typical places for growing crops and are better known for their trees and wildlife, so the correct answer is farmer's field.
Answer:
farmer's field
Question: Where are you likely to see more than one office building?
Options: A) work, B) industrial complex, C) city, D) new york, E) suburbia,
Knowledge: Cities are well-known for having multiple office buildings, as they are usually the center of business and commerce. Industrial complexes may also have office buildings, but the context of the sentence is not related to industry specifically. Work refers to any location where someone may be employed, so it could be any of the options given. New York is a specific city but not all cities are like New York. Suburbia is the opposite of a city and typically has fewer large office buildings.
Answer:
city

Question: The training explained his job was to serve customers, whatever they needed he should do what?
Options: A) help, B) come back, C) smile, D) money, E) pay to,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's job is to serve customers, which implies that their primary responsibility is to assist customers with whatever they need. The word "help" directly corresponds to this idea and is therefore the correct answer. The other options (such as "come back" or "pay to") do not make any sense in the context of serving customers. "Smile" may be a part of providing good customer service, but it is not the main responsibility of the person mentioned in the sentence. "Money" implies a transactional relationship, which again doesn't fit with the idea of serving customers.
Answer:
help
Question: If a person isn't thick they are what?
Options: A) sparse, B) slender, C) unacquainted, D) skinny, E) free flowing,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the opposite of being "thick" is being something else. From the choices, only "slender" is a common antonym for "thick," meaning thin or slim. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
slender

Options: A) become smartet, B) inspiration, C) gain knowledge, D) go to sleep, E) gaining knowledge,
Knowledge: Attending a lecture is a common way for students to acquire knowledge on a specific subject. The fact that the student is attending a lecture on engineering suggests that they are interested in learning about this field of study and hope to gain knowledge from the lecture. The other options, such as becoming smarter or going to sleep, do not fit the context of attending a lecture on a specific subject.
Answer:
gain knowledge
Question: If there is no windows in the area where are you likely to find a fire extinguisher?
Options: A) house, B) stairwell, C) school bus, D) window, E) garage,
Knowledge: Fire extinguishers are typically placed in areas where fires are more likely to occur, such as kitchens, workshops, or mechanical rooms. In a building with no windows, it is important to have a fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergencies. A stairwell is a common location for fire extinguishers because it is a central location and easy to access from different parts of the building. The other options do not make much sense in the context of the question.
Answer:
stairwell
Question: Where would a sofabed be used only for guests?
Options: A) sitting room, B) living room, C) basement, D) dinning roam, E) spare room,
Knowledge: The question implies that the sofabed is not a permanent fixture in the room and is only used for guests, suggesting that it is located in a room specifically designated for visitors. The options sitting room, living room, and dining room are typically used by the residents of the house, making them less suitable for a guest sleeping arrangement, while a basement is not necessarily a common area for guests. A spare room is often set up specifically for guests and may include a variety of sleeping arrangements, including a sofabed.
Answer:
spare room

The phrase "yellow pages" refers to a directory that lists businesses and their contact information, which was commonly used before the widespread adoption of digital technologies. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
yellow pages
Question: What would you need to do to start work if you do not work in your house?
Options: A) walk in rain, B) sleep at night, C) go somewhere, D) rest, E) ride bus,
Knowledge: The question is asking what you need to do if you don't work from home, implying that you need to go somewhere to start work. The other options do not relate to the context of the question. Walking in the rain, sleeping at night, resting, and riding a bus are not actions that specifically relate to starting work or leaving your home.
Answer:
go somewhere
Question: Where is building likely to be rapid?
Options: A) urban area, B) home, C) town, D) rooms, E) office,
Knowledge: The word "rapid" suggests that the question is asking about a place where construction is happening quickly or on a large scale. Urban areas are typically known for having high population densities and high demand for new buildings, which can drive rapid construction. The other options do not have any clear association with rapid building.
Answer:
urban area
Question: Dan is driving a car.  His foot presses the accelerator.  The car should be doing what?
Options: A) moving, B) going someplace, C) getting somewhere, D) slow down, E) get sleepy,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that Dan is doing something to make the car do something, and the word "accelerator" suggests that he is trying to speed up. Therefore, the correct answer is "moving." The other options either do not make sense in the context of the sentence, or they are the opposite of what is being described (e.g. "slow down").
Answer:
moving
Question: The churchyard was the furthest east in all the contiguous states, it was located in which?
Options: A) country side, B) near the ocean, C) city, D) michigan, E) maine,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location of the churchyard is significant because it is the furthest east in all the contiguous states. Of the given options, Maine is the state furthest east and is therefore the most likely answer. The other options, such as "near the ocean" or "countryside", could apply to many different states and do not provide a clear indication of the specific location of the churchyard.
Answer:
maine
Question: What do you do to win when you compete against someone?
Options: A) cheat, B) fair, C) sabotage, D) practice, E) in competition,
Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is asking for a legitimate and ethical way to improve one's chances of winning in a competition. Cheating and sabotage are unethical and would not result in a genuine victory. Fairness is a basic expectation but does not provide any useful tips for winning. "In competition" is not a specific action that one can take to improve their chances of winning. Practicing, on the other hand, is a well-known way to improve one's skills and increase their chances of success in a competition.
Answer:
practice
Question: The dog really liked the treats, which was good since they were for the health of his what?
Options: A) teeth, B) two eyes, C) four legs, D) one mouth, E) two ears,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the treats the dog enjoyed were beneficial to some aspect of his health. The context implies that the treats were not simply for pleasure, but for a specific purpose. The options "two eyes," "four legs," and "two ears" are irrelevant to the context and do not make sense in relation to the sentence. The option "one mouth" is not specific enough and does not provide any clear indication of why the treats were beneficial. The best answer is "teeth," as treats can be used to clean a dog's teeth and promote good oral health.
Answer:
teeth
Question: What would a paper be if the typing on the paper was made using foreign characters?
Options: A) communication, B) indeterminate, C) carpal tunnel syndrome, D) communicating, E) japanese,
Knowledge: The word "foreign" suggests that the characters being used are not typically used in the language or alphabet of the reader. Therefore, it may be difficult or impossible for the reader to interpret the meaning of the typing, making the paper's content indeterminate or uncertain. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
indeterminate
Question: The ladies at the salon had plenty of curiosity, anytime someone came in they wanted to what?
Options: A) examine thing, B) go to market, C) attend school, D) hear news, E) bad news,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the ladies at the salon are interested in finding out about something, and that they are eager to hear news whenever someone new arrives. This suggests that they are looking for updates on current events, gossip, or other developments that may be of interest to them. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or suggest a desire to learn about something new.
Answer:
hear news
Question: The machine was very intricate, it was quite an what?
Options: A) box, B) apparatus, C) appliance, D) wash dishes, E) implement,
Knowledge: The word "intricate" suggests that the machine had many complex and detailed components.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Options: A) at hotel, B) restaurant, C) public building, D) public place, E) apartment,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being referred to lives in New York City and has a bathroom that they use frequently. Based on common living situations in New York City, it is likely that the person lives in an apartment, which is the most common type of housing in the city. The other choices do not have any clear connection to the idea of a personal bathroom for someone living in New York City.
Answer:
apartment
Question: The lady was eating less sweets and snacks, this did what to her weight?
Options: A) defecating, B) reduced, C) will be fatty, D) becoming full, E) gaining weight,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lady was trying to reduce her intake of sweets and snacks, which typically contain high amounts of sugar and calories. As a result, it can be inferred that her weight would likely decrease if she continued to eat less of these types of foods. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - defecating is a bodily function, becoming full is a temporary sensation, and gaining weight goes against the goal of the lady trying to eat less sweets and snacks.
Answer:
reduced
Question: The committee represent the rest of the members, they met every Sunday right after what?
Options: A) church, B) park, C) business, D) government, E) city hall,

The other options are not typically associated with meetings for committees or organizations.
Answer:
church
Question: What do you put on the surface covered with linoleum?
Options: A) kitchen floor, B) house, C) furniture, D) mobile home, E) living room,
Knowledge: Linoleum is a type of flooring material that is often used in high-traffic areas such as kitchens and living rooms. However, the question specifically asks what you would put on the surface covered with linoleum, which suggests that the answer should be something placed on top of the linoleum. Furniture is a common item that is placed on flooring surfaces, regardless of the material. The other options are not necessarily associated with being placed on top of a flooring surface.
Answer:
furniture
Question: The cows were enjoying the sunshine and solitude by the barn, where were they?
Options: A) fairgrounds, B) countryside, C) on the moon, D) farmyard, E) give birth to dogs,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions cows enjoying sunshine and solitude by a barn, which suggests that they are on a farm. The option "countryside" also suggests this, as farms are often located in rural areas. The other options, such as "fairgrounds" and "on the moon," have no connection to the context of the sentence and can be disregarded. "Give birth to dogs" is also an absurd option that does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
farmyard
Question: Where could you find a barbershop that is not in a separate building from other stores?
Options: A) hair salon, B) small town, C) shopping mall, D) village, E) city,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the barbershop is located within a larger structure that houses multiple stores. Shopping malls often have multiple stores under one roof, making them a likely place to find a barbershop that is not in a separate building. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
shopping mall
Question: While still on a trip there's pretty much only one place to unload your luggage, where?
Options: A) at hotel, B) train station, C) ship, D) bus stop, E) bus depot,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker has been traveling and needs to unload their luggage, which is something typically done at a hotel. Hotels are places where travelers can stay and store their luggage while they explore the area. Train stations, ship decks, and bus depots may have luggage storage facilities, but they are not typically the first places people think of when looking to unload their luggage. A bus stop usually doesn't have any storage facilities at all.
Answer:

Options: A) hunting lodge, B) soho, C) frame house, D) room and board, E) city apartment,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe chose to rent a type of living space called a loft. A loft is typically a large, open space in a city building that was originally used for a commercial or industrial purpose and has been converted into living quarters. Soho is a neighborhood in New York City known for its artsy loft apartments, but it is not a type of living space. A hunting lodge is a rustic, rural accommodation for hunters, and a frame house is a type of traditional suburban or rural dwelling. Room and board usually refers to a type of short-term accommodation, such as a hotel or guesthouse.
Answer:
city apartment
Question: I'm getting warm because I increased the thermostat in my bedroom.  What might I be doing soon?
Options: A) feeling comfortable, B) overheat, C) increase of temperature, D) pleasure, E) starting fire,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that turning up the thermostat has made the person feel warmer, which is a common goal when adjusting the temperature. Feeling comfortable is the most likely outcome of making this change. Overheating and starting a fire are unlikely consequences of simply increasing the thermostat in a bedroom, while an increase in temperature and pleasure are not necessarily related to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
feeling comfortable
Question: Sterotypically, people read the newspaper with their family early in the morning.  What is something else that people also do with their family when they first wake up?
Options: A) aggravation, B) go  for a walk, C) zip cup of tea, D) drink coffee, E) eat breakfast,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people typically engage in a morning activity with their family, and the choices reflect different possible options. However, the word "stereotypically" suggests that there may be some cultural or social expectations surrounding this activity. Eating breakfast is a common family activity in many cultures, and it is often seen as a time for sharing and bonding. The other options may not be as popular or widely practiced in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
eat breakfast
Question: Little cameras in the car made doing what easier?
Options: A) technical difficulties, B) heat up, C) carpooler, D) set off, E) back up,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the little cameras in the car made something easier, and the context of the sentence implies that it has to do with driving or parking. "Back up" is the only option that directly relates to driving and parking, as having cameras in the back of a car can make it easier to see and navigate when reversing. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
back up
Question: You go through a lot of training to be a soldier, this is to prepare you to do what?
Options: A) follow orders, B) wait for orders, C) follow instructions, D) fight for freedom, E) fight enemy,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that soldiers undergo a significant amount of training, which presumably prepares them for a specific task. The phrase "fight for freedom" seems like a plausible choice, but the sentence does not indicate that this is the purpose of the training. Instead, it suggests that the training is intended to prepare soldiers to engage in combat with an opponent, which makes "fight enemy" the correct choice. The other options, such as following orders or instructions, may be part of a soldier's training, but they do not capture the main purpose of the training that is mentioned in the sentence.
Answer:
fight enemy
Question: John played a brass drum very well.  He loved classical music and decided that he wanted to join what?
Options: A) low notes, B) rock band, C) sing, D) orchestra, E) drum set,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John enjoys playing a specific instrument (a brass drum) and has an interest in classical music. Orchestras typically play classical music compositions and often include brass drum instruments. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well - "low notes" could refer to any instrument, "rock band" is unrelated to classical music, "sing" does not involve playing an instrument, and "drum set" is not specific enough to match the description of a brass drum.
Answer:
orchestra
Question: What is a corrupt government likely to lead to?
Options: A) civilization, B) money, C) city, D) control, E) trouble,
Knowledge: The word "corrupt" implies unethical and dishonest behavior, which can lead to negative consequences such as instability, unrest, and social unrest. In the context of a government, corruption often involves bribery, nepotism and misallocation of resources, which can lead to economic decline and exacerbate inequalities, among other things. The term "civilization" implies a more positive outcome, and the other options do not fit with the negative connotations of corruption.
Answer:

Question: Where can you buy lettuce directly from the grower?
Options: A) supermarket, B) grocery store, C) salad, D) farmer's market, E) refrigerator,
Knowledge: Farmer's markets are well-known for selling fresh produce directly from the grower. This means that lettuce can be purchased directly from the person who grew it, allowing for a fresher and more direct connection between the consumer and the producer. Supermarkets and grocery stores typically sell produce that has been transported from larger farms to a central distribution center, and then to the store. Salad refers to a dish made from lettuce and other ingredients, and a refrigerator is an appliance used to store food, not a place to buy it.
Answer:
farmer's market

Options: A) feeling good, B) helpfulness, C) getting a job, D) trouble, E) death,

The other options, such as "feeling good" or "helpfulness," do not have a clear connection to avoiding negative outcomes.
Answer:
trouble

Options: A) bed, B) airport, C) mall, D) homes, E) bathroom,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jane is waiting for a ride, which is likely to be transportation-related. The option "airport" stands out because it is a common place for people to wait for rides and is often associated with the stress of making a flight. The option "bathroom" seems like the most logical choice given the context, but the sentence specifically states that Jane is not in the bathroom.
Answer:
airport
Question: Where does a human likely not want to be?
Options: A) jail, B) church, C) school, D) house, E) park,
Knowledge: A jail is a place where people are typically sent as a form of punishment and confinement, so it's reasonable to assume that a human would not want to be there. The other options (church, school, house, park) do not inherently carry negative connotations, and humans may even enjoy spending time in those places.
Answer:
jail
Question: What does one do when they play games?
Options: A) try to win, B) learn, C) fun, D) dance, E) keep score,
Knowledge: The word "games" usually implies some level of competition or goal-oriented activity. To "play" a game usually means to engage in an activity with the intention of achieving a specific outcome or objective, such as winning. While some games can also be educational or focused on creativity (e.g. "learning" or "dancing" games), the majority of games involve trying to beat one's opponents or achieve a high score. Therefore, "try to win" is the most appropriate answer to this question.
Answer:
try to win

Answer:
kitchen

Options: A) dance, B) marry each other, C) french kissing, D) make sex, E) plan to marry,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy and Marge were a couple who enjoyed spending time together, but were not interested in a serious relationship or being intimate. The option "dance" is the most appropriate answer as it is an activity that two people can enjoy together in a non-romantic way. The other options imply a more serious or intimate relationship between the two, which is not suggested in the sentence.
Answer:
dance

Options: A) work harder, B) cease fire, C) surrender, D) defend, E) defence,

The phrase "game over" also implies that the game had ended, further supporting the idea that surrender was the appropriate choice. The other options, such as working harder or defending, do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest the player was still trying to win.
Answer:
surrender
Question: You will find many a cannon on what vessel full of criminals?

Knowledge: The question is asking for something that can be used to plan a driving route to the Pacific Ocean. An atlas is a book of maps that can help in this process. The other options are not relevant to the context of the question.

Knowledge: A music store is a common place to buy musical instruments, including pianos.

Answer:
music store

Options: A) give up, B) obesity, C) feeling satisfied, D) get sleepy, E) feel full,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having a sizable lunch has a specific result.

Knowledge: Popcorn is a common snack that is often associated with movie theaters, where it is a popular option for moviegoers.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Answer:
movie theater
Question: Where could you put some olives to keep them fresh?
Options: A) jar, B) pressed for thier oil, C) ice box, D) pizza, E) refrigerator,
Knowledge: The question is asking where olives can be stored to keep them fresh. The choice "jar" could work, but it is not clear if the jar needs to be stored in a specific place. "Pressed for their oil" is not relevant to storing olives. "Ice box" is an outdated term for a refrigerator, so it could work. "Pizza" is not a storage option. "Refrigerator" is the clearest choice as it specifically refers to a place where food can be stored to keep it fresh.
Answer:
refrigerator
Question: How do birds leave the nest?
Options: A) sing songs, B) lay eggs, C) falling down, D) reproduce, E) spread wings,
Knowledge: Birds typically leave their nest by spreading their wings and flying away. This is a natural and instinctive behavior for most bird species. Singing songs and laying eggs are not related to leaving the nest, while falling down is a potential but unlikely way for a bird to leave the nest. Reproduction is also not related to leaving the nest as it is a separate process that occurs before the young birds hatch and learn to fly.
Answer:
spread wings

Answer:
chair

Options: A) cool off, B) dive, C) eat ice cream, D) buy beer, E) wear shorts,
Knowledge: The question implies that someone is looking to find relief from the heat, even if they are unable to swim or have allergies. "Cool off" is the most logical option because it offers a solution to beating the heat without requiring swimming or causing an allergic reaction. "Dive", "buy beer", and "wear shorts" are all unlikely solutions or may even exacerbate the problem, and while "eat ice cream" may provide temporary relief, it is not the most effective or practical solution for cooling off.
Answer:
cool off
Question: What must a crab cross to reach the ocean?
Options: A) lakes, B) shore line, C) shallow waters, D) tidepools, E) atlantic ocean,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the crab is on land and needs to cross something to reach the ocean. Out of the given options, the shore line is the most likely answer as it refers to the boundary between land and sea. The other options (lakes, shallow waters, tidepools, and the Atlantic ocean) do not fit the context of the sentence as they either do not require a crossing from land or are not relevant to the location being described.
Answer:
shore line
Question: Some do not enjoy getting drunk, it gives them what?
Options: A) intoxication, B) relaxation, C) fights, D) nausea, E) death,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting drunk is not a desirable experience for everyone, and lists the potential negative outcome of getting drunk as a clue to the answer.

Answer:
nausea
Question: If I am hungrier than I am thirsty for a drink, what should I do?
Options: A) open mouth, B) eat first, C) use glass, D) buy soda, E) slurp,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is more hungry than thirsty, so it would be best for them to eat before drinking. Eating would provide nourishment and help satisfy their hunger, while drinking alone may not be sufficient. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
eat first
Question: Where can you find bald eagles and cheese in the midwest?
Options: A) colorado, B) currency, C) iowa, D) arctic, E) wisconsin,
Knowledge: Bald eagles are a symbol of America, and they are often found near bodies of water where they can hunt fish. Wisconsin has many lakes and rivers where bald eagles nest and hunt.

The other options do not have a clear association with bald eagles or cheese.
Answer:
wisconsin
Question: A battleship can be sunk by an unseen torpedo fired by a what?
Options: A) patrol boat, B) submarine, C) corvette, D) destroyer, E) frigate,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the torpedo was fired from an unseen location, which is a common tactic used by submarines in naval warfare. Submarines are known for their stealth capabilities and ability to attack other ships while remaining hidden underwater. The other options, such as patrol boats or frigates, do not have the same level of stealth and are less likely to be able to launch an unseen attack with a torpedo.
Answer:
submarine
Question: All humans have what which is used to distinguish them from one another?
Options: A) ears, B) feelings, C) names, D) naval, E) bladders,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the characteristic being referred to is used to distinguish humans from each other, which rules out options like ears and bladders that all humans have. Feelings are a subjective experience and cannot be used to identify individuals, while naval is an anatomical feature that is not unique to each person. Names, on the other hand, are given to individuals as identifiers and are unique to each person, making them the correct answer.
Answer:
names
Question: Where would green beans be found directly before eating?
Options: A) bathroom, B) plate, C) container, D) farmer's market, E) mouth,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the green beans are being prepared for consumption, which means they would likely be placed on a plate before being eaten. The other options, such as the bathroom or container, do not make sense in this context. The farmer's market may be where the green beans were purchased, but it is not directly connected to the act of eating them. The mouth is where the beans end up, not where they are found before eating.
Answer:
plate
Question: They mocked their friend for being timid, but it kept her out of the trouble they got into by being what?
Options: A) reckless, B) aggressive, C) insane, D) bellicose, E) dauntless,
Knowledge: The sentence contrasts the timid friend with the trouble the others got into, suggesting that their behavior was opposite to hers. The word "reckless" means acting without thinking about the consequences, which would be a direct contrast to the timid behavior of the friend. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence as they do not suggest an opposite behavior to being timid.
Answer:
reckless

Options: A) make noise, B) make time, C) make payments, D) make hay, E) make peace,
Knowledge: Going to a concert typically involves listening to music, dancing, and enjoying the performance of the artist on stage.

Answer:
bar

Options: A) fridge, B) jar, C) plate, D) house, E) pantry,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that fresh baked cookies are a common occurrence at Grandma's place, which is likely to be her house. The other options (fridge, jar, plate, pantry) are unlikely, as they do not necessarily indicate a place where fresh baked cookies are found. A fridge implies a refrigerated space, jars and plates are storage vessels, and a pantry is usually a room for storing non-perishable food items.
Answer:
house
Question: The rug saw a lot of foot traffic and had popcorn strewn about, where was it likely?
Options: A) backyard, B) bedroom, C) desk, D) table, E) living room,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location of the rug is a place where many people walk and eat popcorn, which is commonly associated with a living room. Living rooms are often the central gathering place in a home where people relax, socialize, and watch TV, making it likely that the rug would see a lot of foot traffic and have popcorn scattered about. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: Where can I put a coin to stop my car from being towed?
Options: A) piggy bank, B) wishing well, C) change purse, D) slot machine, E) parking meter,
Knowledge: The question suggests that there is a specific location where a coin can be placed in order to prevent a car from being towed. A parking meter is a likely choice because it is common for drivers to pay for parking with coins inserted into the meter. The other options, such as a piggy bank, wishing well, change purse, or slot machine, have no connection to the context of the question and do not provide any indication of a place to put a coin to prevent a car from being towed.
Answer:
parking meter
Question: Expressing yourself in public without wearing pants will likely result in what?
Options: A) happiness, B) blank stares, C) communication, D) getting arrested, E) stage fright,

Options: A) department store, B) laundry room, C) garbage can, D) jewelry store, E) free shop,

Answer:

Question: It was a popular and common gift this year, so he headed to the what where it would be easy to find?
Options: A) christmas tree, B) christmas stocking, C) specialty store, D) department store, E) closet,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the gift in question was popular and common, which suggests that it would be widely available in a commercial setting rather than a personal space like a closet. Additionally, the mention of heading somewhere suggests that the person is looking for a specific location or type of store, and a department store is a common location for purchasing gifts due to its wide range of products. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well, as a christmas tree and stocking are not places to buy gifts, and a specialty store may not carry a widely popular gift item.
Answer:
department store
Question: Sam eat a big dinner.  He eventually stopped having food because he experienced a pleasant sensation.  What did he experience?
Options: A) feeling of fullness, B) weight gain, C) nausea, D) not hungry, E) upset stomach,
Knowledge: When someone eats a big dinner and stops eating because they feel satisfied, they are likely experiencing a feeling of fullness. This occurs when the stomach stretches to accommodate the food and sends signals to the brain that it is time to stop eating. The other options, such as weight gain, nausea, and upset stomach, are unlikely to be associated with a feeling of pleasantness or satisfaction after a meal. "Not hungry" is also not the best option since it does not describe a pleasant sensation, but rather a lack of appetite.
Answer:
feeling of fullness
Question: The teen wanted to impress his girlfriend by doing housework, what impresses the girl?
Options: A) boredom, B) chores, C) allergies, D) pain and suffering, E) cleanliness,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teen wanted to impress his girlfriend by doing housework, so the answer must be related to the concept of housework. The option "boredom" does not make sense as something that impresses someone, while "chores" is too general and does not differentiate the teen's actions from regular housework. "Allergies" and "pain and suffering" are negative experiences that the girlfriend is unlikely to be impressed by. Therefore, the most logical answer is "cleanliness," which is the outcome of doing housework and could be seen as a positive trait in a partner.
Answer:
cleanliness
Question: I am at school and want a glass of milk, where do I look?
Options: A) home, B) cafeteria, C) under the cow., D) menu, E) accompaniment to meal,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that the person is at school, which suggests that they may have access to a cafeteria or dining hall. The other options (home, under the cow) are not relevant to the context of being at school. The option "menu" may be helpful in finding out if milk is available in the cafeteria, but it does not provide a direct answer to the question. "Accompaniment to meal" is also not specific enough, as there may be other options besides milk that are served with meals.
Answer:
cafeteria

The term "base" is commonly used to refer to the part of an object that serves as its foundation or support, such as the base of a statue or the base of a lamp. The other options (home, subordinate, foot, point) do not make logical sense in the context of the question.

The teacher then offered advice to the student by telling them to "just listen." This strongly suggests that the correct answer is related to learning through listening. The phrase "you'll learn" fits this context perfectly, as it conveys the idea that by paying attention and listening carefully, the student will be able to learn and improve. The other options do not make sense in this context, and are not related to the idea of learning through listening.
Answer:
you'll learn
Question: James heard thunder while he was putting up the overhead lamps. It hit very close.   James worried that he might be killed while installing what?

Options: A) fun, B) choir, C) describe singing voice, D) chorus, E) concert,
Knowledge: A contralto is a type of singing voice, specifically the lowest female singing voice type. The context of the sentence suggests that attending an event where a contralto is being enjoyed would likely be a musical performance or concert, rather than a more casual gathering like a fun or choir practice. The options "describe singing voice" and "chorus" are partially correct, as they both relate to singing, but do not specifically indicate an event or performance.
Answer:

A phrase is a group of words that does not contain a subject and verb, while a dictionary is a reference book that contains definitions of words. English and language are too broad and general to accurately describe the specific structure of a sentence.
Answer:

Knowledge: The mention of men in robes suggests a religious setting, which is further supported by the option "church." Wine and crackers are commonly served during religious ceremonies such as communion, making church the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
church
Question: The car hit the curb at high speed, what happened as a result?
Options: A) go downtown, B) roll over, C) appear suddenly, D) bottom out, E) dissappeared,
Knowledge: When a car hits a curb at high speed, it can cause the wheels to hit the curb and then come down forcefully, which is known as "bottoming out." This can cause damage to the underside of the car and may also affect the alignment of the wheels. Rolling over is also a possibility if the car hits the curb at a certain angle or speed, but it is less likely based on the wording of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
bottom out

Options: A) san francisco bay, B) northwest, C) southern hemisphere, D) west, E) atlas,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location being referred to is a port city on the west coast of the U.S. where ships from the Pacific Ocean unload their cargo. San Francisco Bay is a well-known port in California, situated on the west coast of the U.S. and known for its large-scale commercial operations, shipping, and maritime industries. The other options, such as northwest, southern hemisphere, west, and atlas, do not fit the specific criteria set forth in the sentence.

Question: Where would you store potatoes for the winter?
Options: A) countryside, B) sliced, C) cellar, D) restaurant, E) fried,
Knowledge: Potatoes need to be stored in a cool, dark and dry place to prevent sprouting and rotting.

Options: A) space shuttle, B) anywhere on earth, C) strip club, D) church, E) international space station,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the human had a desire for something sexual in nature, which is often associated with strip clubs as they feature exotic dancers. The other options, such as the space shuttle or international space station, have no clear connection to fulfilling lustful needs. The church is typically associated with suppressing such desires, so it would be an unlikely choice. "Anywhere on earth" is too general and does not provide any specific context to make a knowledgeable choice.
Answer:
strip club

Options: A) book store, B) library, C) find information resources, D) store, E) kitchen,
Knowledge: A card catalog is a tool used for organizing and locating materials in libraries or other information resource centers. Therefore, options such as book store and library are likely to use a card catalog. On the other hand, a store might use a digital catalogue, but a card catalog is less likely. The kitchen has no relevance to information or resources, making it an unlikely location to use a card catalog.
Answer:
kitchen

Options: A) culture, B) inspiration, C) higher intelligence, D) increasing knowledge, E) better grades,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after studying, the person came to the conclusion that there was something more than just man's brain at work. The phrase "made sense" indicates that a logical conclusion was reached. The option "higher intelligence" fits well as it suggests something beyond the normal intelligence of a human being. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: If a student wishes to learn about things that have already happened, what should they do?
Options: A) better grade, B) pass course, C) study history, D) complete test ask questions, E) answer question,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the student is interested in learning about past events. "Study history" is a specific and direct answer that addresses this question, while the other options do not provide information that is relevant to the topic at hand. "Pass course," "better grade," "complete test," "ask questions," and "answer question" are all related to completing a course or an assignment, but none of them indicate a desire to learn about past events specifically.
Answer:
study history
Question: What do most people often feel before meeting new people?
Options: A) being bored, B) making new friends, C) love, D) anxiety, E) happy,
Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that meeting new people can be a nerve-wracking experience, which is commonly associated with feelings of anxiety or nervousness. While some people may feel excited about the prospect of making new friends, the question specifies "most people," so this option is less likely to be the correct answer. "Being bored" and "love" are not associated with meeting new people, so they can be eliminated as well. "Happy" is also not the best fit in this scenario, as meeting new people can be a stressful experience for many individuals.
Answer:
anxiety
Question: A person regrets their actions, what are they likely to have?
Options: A) deception, B) bad feelings, C) live in poverty, D) indigestion, E) schizophrenia,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is experiencing remorse or a sense of guilt about their actions, which is commonly associated with feeling bad.

Answer:
bad feelings

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: How might someone relieve stress with friends?
Options: A) hang out at bar, B) running, C) drink alcohol, D) clean house, E) dream,
Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a way to relieve stress with friends, and hanging out at a bar with friends is a common activity that can help to relieve stress. Socializing with friends has been shown to have a positive effect on mental health and can provide a sense of support, which can be helpful in managing stress. Running may also be a stress-relieving activity, but it is not specifically related to being with friends. Drinking alcohol may initially relieve stress, but can ultimately make the problem worse in the long run. Cleaning the house and dreaming are not social activities that involve being with friends.
Answer:
hang out at bar
Question: Where is there typically small unpaved lanes?
Options: A) city, B) rural countryside, C) bowling alley, D) highway, E) estonia,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that small unpaved lanes can be found somewhere, and the options given provide different locations where they might be found. A city is unlikely to have many small unpaved lanes, as most streets in a city are paved. A bowling alley is an indoor location and has nothing to do with small unpaved lanes. Highways are large and often paved, so they are not likely to have small unpaved lanes either. Estonia is a country and not a location where small unpaved lanes might be found. Therefore, the correct answer is rural countryside, as small unpaved lanes are a common feature of rural areas.
Answer:
rural countryside
Question: The teacher yelled at her students, what prompted her to do that?
Options: A) answering questions, B) talk too much, C) teach children, D) to start lunch, E) open boxes,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason why the teacher yelled at her students is related to their talking behavior. Talking too much in class is commonly considered as disruptive and can negatively impact other students' learning. Therefore, it's likely that the teacher scolded her students for not following the classroom rules or for distracting others with their talking. The other options, such as answering questions, teaching children or opening boxes, do not seem to be valid reasons for the teacher's outburst.
Answer:
talk too much
Question: John was playing football when he suffered a concussion.  He was really worried about the possible consequences of his sport, but the concussion was less scary than what?
Options: A) head injuries, B) having fun, C) being sick, D) death, E) getting hurt,
Knowledge: The sentence describes John's worry about the potential risks of football, specifically mentioning his fear of the consequences of his sport. The fact that the concussion was less scary than something else suggests that the other option must be even more severe or dangerous. Out of the remaining choices, death is the most severe outcome and the one that would likely cause the most fear and concern. The other options do not convey the same sense of severity or potential danger.
Answer:
death
Question: While you're at the store buy beer what happens to your wealth?
Options: A) relaxation, B) get arrested, C) wealth increases, D) losing money, E) pleasure,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that buying beer at the store will have a negative impact on your wealth, which implies that it will cost you money to make the purchase. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence: relaxation and pleasure may be outcomes of buying beer, but they don't address the impact on wealth; getting arrested is unlikely to result from simply buying beer. Wealth increasing would require additional information or context not provided in the sentence.
Answer:
losing money
Question: The mother knew her children to be messy, so she always kept extra kleenex in her what?
Options: A) blow nose, B) box, C) wipe nose, D) purse, E) pocket,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the mother is prepared for her children's messy habits by keeping extra tissues handy. Since the question specifically mentions a "purse," it suggests that this is where the mother keeps the tissues. The other options like "pocket" or "box" do not fit the context of the sentence because they do not suggest a place where someone would keep extra tissues for easy access.
Answer:
purse
Question: What is likely to happen to someone involved in a driving accident?
Options: A) traffic jams, B) rainbow, C) injuries, D) boredom, E) fatigue,
Knowledge: Driving accidents typically involve collisions or crashes between vehicles, which can result in injuries to the drivers and passengers involved.

Answer:
injuries
Question: Where is a good place to store water?
Options: A) toilet, B) jar, C) bridge, D) ocean, E) boot,

A bridge or an ocean are not containers and cannot store water.
Answer:
jar
Question: Where would most people store their fortune?
Options: A) imagination, B) bank, C) cookie, D) treasure chest, E) gold,

Answer:

Options: A) tube, B) outside, C) store, D) bathroom, E) refrigerator,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is using hair styling gel, which is a personal grooming product commonly stored in the bathroom or on a bathroom vanity. The other options (tube, outside, store, refrigerator) do not make sense in the context of storing hair styling gel.

Options: A) two arms, B) lay eggs, C) video game, D) two eyes, E) ten fingers,

Out of the choices, only ten fingers fit this description as they are used for both fine motor skills (e.g. typing, writing) and gross motor skills (e.g. gripping, lifting). The other options either do not serve multiple functions or do not have an abundance in humans (e.g. laying eggs).
Answer:
ten fingers

Question: Where is a small registry office likely to be located?
Options: A) court house, B) city, C) town, D) office building, E) merchant,
Knowledge: A small registry office is likely to be located in a town rather than a city or office building, as it serves a smaller population and would not require a large building or a central location like city offices usually do. A court house would not typically be referred to as a registry office, and a merchant is not a location where a registry office would be found.
Answer:
town
Question: Where would be the closest place you would find a piece of literature you own?
Options: A) under the bed, B) own home, C) books and magazines, D) meeting, E) public library,
Knowledge: The question is asking for the closest place where a specific piece of literature can be found. The most likely place would be someone's own home, where they keep their personal belongings. The other options do not make sense in this context: "under the bed" might suggest a hiding spot or a forgotten location, "books and magazines" is too broad and may not contain the specific piece of literature being referred to, "meeting" is unrelated to the question, and "public library" may not be the closest place if the person already owns the literature.
Answer:
own home

Answer:
transportation system

Answer:

Options: A) write code, B) executable file, C) compile, D) think logically, E) get frustrated,

Once the code is written, it must be compiled into an executable file that the computer can understand and run. Compiling translates the human-readable code into machine code that can be executed by the computer processor. While thinking logically is an important part of programming, it is not a step in creating a program. Getting frustrated is also not a necessary step in the process.
Answer:

The choices "library," "kitchen," and "phone booth" are unlikely options for finding a telephone directory related to the building, while "front desk" may be a possibility but not as specific as "building." Therefore, "building" is the most logical choice.
Answer:
building

Options: A) bad movie, B) pool hall, C) bathtub, D) outside, E) marine museum,

A marine museum is a facility that is dedicated to showcasing marine life and educating the public about the world's oceans.

"Outside" is too broad a category and could refer to anything from a park to a desert.
Answer:

The options "beehive" and "porch" do not fit this description, while "post office" would not typically contain multiple homes. "Front door" is too vague and could apply to any building. "Apartment building" is the most likely option that fits the description given in the sentence.
Answer:
apartment building
Question: Jane goes out the door to find outside a bright object, what is she looking for?
Options: A) moon, B) ground, C) sun, D) nature, E) sky,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Jane sees a bright object outside, which is most likely the sun. The sun is a bright object that can be easily seen outside during daylight hours, whereas the moon is typically visible at night. The ground and nature do not necessarily have any association with a bright object, and the sky is too general of a term to indicate any specific object.
Answer:
sun

The word "permanent" means lasting or enduring, which fits with the man's desire for a long-term change in his life. The other options do not convey the same sense of lasting change; "concretely" and "constant" refer to the manner or nature of the change, while "remain stable" and "stagnant" suggest a lack of change altogether.
Answer:
permanent

Options: A) misperception, B) jury, C) knowing yourself, D) ignorance, E) experience,
Explanation: The sentence suggests that James enjoys being a judge, but he only has his own perspective to base his judgments on. This implies that James is relying on his personal experience to make judgments, rather than relying on external sources of information. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence in the same way - misperception suggests that James may be making incorrect judgments, knowing yourself implies a level of self-awareness that is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence, ignorance suggests a lack of knowledge or understanding, and a jury would imply a group of people rather than an individual perspective.
Answer:

The other options (growing mold, accent garden, green, painting) do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:

"Intimacy" is a word that commonly refers to physical closeness and affection between romantic partners, which would be an appropriate activity for a newlywed couple who are alone together. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "headaches" and "riots" are negative events and "ocean" is unrelated to the situation. "Enjoyment" could be a possible answer, but it is too general and doesn't give any specific information about what the couple will be doing.

The other options (desktop, smartphone, wrist watch, and date book) are all digital or non-paper options for keeping track of dates and appointments.

The bathroom is not a common place for a bookshelf, and neither is a book store or furniture store. While a library would have many bookshelves, it is not a personal location where someone would have their own small bookshelf.

The other options are unlikely places to store excess corn, as a storage building may not be designed for grains, a restaurant does not typically store raw ingredients, Pennsylvania is a geographic location, and a supermarket typically purchases corn from suppliers rather than storing excess crops.
Answer:
silo
Question: If something isn't plain but has adornments, what is it called?
Options: A) bells and whistles, B) fancy, C) exotic, D) decorative, E) extravagant,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being described has additional adornments or decorations, which makes the option "decorative" the correct answer. The other options are more closely associated with extravagance or excess, rather than simply having adornments. For example, "bells and whistles" suggests that the object has many unnecessary features, while "extravagant" implies that it is luxurious or excessive. "Fancy" and "exotic" can both suggest a sense of uniqueness, but do not necessarily imply additional decorations or adornments.
Answer:
decorative
Question: What could cause a driving car to stop?
Options: A) on time, B) pollution, C) death, D) sickness, E) run out of gas,
Knowledge: The question asks for a possible reason why a driving car might stop, and one common reason is running out of gas. This occurs when the fuel level in the car's tank reaches zero, causing the engine to stop. The other choices are not relevant to the context of a car stopping while driving. "On time" and "pollution" are not causes of a car stopping, while "death" and "sickness" refer to human conditions that would not affect a car.
Answer:
run out of gas
Question: Debbie noticed that there was a ficus decorating the room while she was getting a perm.  Where was this plant?
Options: A) arboretum, B) hair salon, C) family room, D) flower garden, E) in the sink,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Debbie was getting a perm when she noticed the ficus, which implies that she was in a place where people go to get their hair done, such as a hair salon. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. An arboretum is a place where one would go to see many different types of plants, a family room would typically not have a plant as part of its decor, and a flower garden would not commonly have a ficus tree growing in it. The option "in the sink" is clearly not a valid choice given the context of the sentence.
Answer:
hair salon
Question: The tree wanted to grow more, but in the garden why did the roots stop spreading?
Options: A) affected by weather, B) wall in, C) grow tall, D) burn, E) hatred,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tree is unable to spread its roots further, which implies a physical barrier preventing it from doing so. The option "wall in" is the only one that refers to a physical obstruction that could limit root growth in a garden. The other options, such as weather, growth patterns, and emotions, do not provide any explanation for why the tree's roots would stop spreading.
Answer:
wall in
Question: What are people more likely to do when they drink alcohol at a bar?
Options: A) dance, B) become inebriated, C) urinate, D) sleep at night, E) socialize,
Knowledge: Drinking alcohol at a bar is typically associated with socializing with friends or meeting new people. Dancing may also be popular, but it is not the most common activity associated with drinking at a bar. Becoming inebriated, urinating, and sleeping at night are negative outcomes of drinking too much alcohol and do not necessarily reflect what people are more likely to do when they drink at a bar.
Answer:
socialize
Question: The baby came unexpectedly, what did it do?
Options: A) died, B) boy or girl, C) learn to walk, D) talk nonsense, E) arrive early,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the baby arrived unexpectedly, meaning it was not due at that time. Therefore, the correct answer would be "arrive early." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Died" is too extreme and not indicated by the sentence. "Boy or girl" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence, and the baby's gender is not mentioned. "Learn to walk" is not something a baby would do immediately after being born. "Talk nonsense" is unlikely for a newborn baby.
Answer:
arrive early
Question: They had to take the motorway and famous turnpike to get to the even MTV-made famous shore, where were they?
Options: A) race track, B) new jersey, C) usa, D) england, E) city,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions the "MTV-made famous shore", which is a reference to the reality TV show "Jersey Shore". The show was set in New Jersey, specifically in the town of Seaside Heights, which is known for its beach and boardwalk. The sentence also mentions "the motorway and famous turnpike", which are both major highways in the northeastern United States, particularly in New Jersey. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: How can you get rid of anger?
Options: A) write letter, B) release energy, C) scream, D) pass sentence, E) punch,
Knowledge: Anger is often associated with built-up energy or tension in the body, so releasing that energy can be an effective way to manage it. This can be done through physical exercise, such as going for a run or doing yoga, or engaging in activities that help release pent-up emotion, such as hitting a pillow or screaming into a pillow. Writing a letter or punching something may provide temporary relief, but they don't address the root cause of the anger or help release the energy associated with it. Passing a sentence has no clear connection to managing anger.
Answer:
release energy
Question: What will happen to you if your need is met?
Options: A) unhappy, B) sufficient, C) wants, D) satisfied, E) unnecessary,
Knowledge: The word "need" implies that there is something that the individual lacks or requires in order to feel complete or whole. When a need is fulfilled, the person is likely to feel satisfied, as their requirement has been met. The other options do not necessarily indicate a positive or negative outcome, and they do not specifically address the idea of having a need met.
Answer:
satisfied
Question: James noticed that people who communicate well have fewer problems.  Some people communicate easily with strangers, others need to talk with members of their own groups.  A religion is a type of group.  What do members of a religion have in common?
Options: A) believe in god, B) talk to each other, C) pay bills, D) learn from each other, E) believe in ghosts,
Knowledge: The question suggests that religion is a type of group, and the sentence also mentions that communicating with members of one's own group is important for good communication skills. Additionally, the question specifically asks what members of a religion have in common. The most central and defining characteristic of a religion is belief in a higher power or deity, usually referred to as God. Therefore, the answer is likely "believe in god." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question or the characteristics of religion.
Answer:
believe in god
Question: Where can you get chicken without leaving your car?
Options: A) eaten, B) bbq, C) fast food restaurant, D) plate, E) pizza,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that you can get chicken without leaving your car, which is a common feature of fast food restaurants with drive-thru windows. "BBQ" and "pizza" may also be available at some fast food restaurants, but the sentence specifically refers to chicken. "Plate" is not a location where you can get food, and "eaten" does not make sense in the context of the question.
Answer:
fast food restaurant
Question: The person looked lustfully into his girlfriend's eyes, what did he want to do?
Options: A) fight, B) thank god, C) sun himself, D) race against time, E) express love,
Knowledge: The adverb "lustfully" suggests that the person's gaze was driven by desire, and the fact that the object of the gaze was the person's girlfriend suggests a romantic or sexual attraction. The phrase "looked into his girlfriend's eyes" can imply intimacy, and the use of the verb "express" in the last option reinforces the idea that the person wanted to communicate their feelings to their partner. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
express love
Question: John was told to leave the cheese in the cellar for a few years.  Why is that?
Options: A) strong odor, B) age well, C) salad dressing, D) flavor, E) age to get better,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the cheese needs to be left in the cellar for a few years, which suggests that the cheese needs time to mature or age in order to improve its flavor. The option "age well" is also a good choice as it conveys the same idea. The other options do not explain why the cheese needs to be stored in the cellar for a few years.
Answer:
age to get better
Question: The water spout wouldn't turn off.  Eventually, what was totally filled?
Options: A) the kitchen, B) sink, C) fountain, D) access to water, E) florida,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions a water spout that would not turn off, which implies that there was excess water filling up a container. The only option that refers to a container or receptacle that can hold water is the sink, which is the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
sink
Question: Where might a conductor have a hard time seeing ahead due to darkness?
Options: A) lead orchestra, B) orchestra, C) lead play, D) opera, E) subway,
Knowledge: The phrase "hard time seeing ahead due to darkness" suggests that the answer must refer to a location where it is difficult to see because of poor lighting.

Answer:
subway

Options: A) city center, B) england, C) cheap living, D) ghetto, E) jars,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to live in a specific type of house, which is a brick row house. Row houses are commonly found in older cities like London, which is located in England. The word "foggy" further supports this idea, as London is famous for its foggy weather. The other options, such as city center, cheap living, ghetto, and jars, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
england
Question: Where do families tend to store a lot of boxes?
Options: A) basement, B) mail, C) shoe store, D) warehouse, E) cellar,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that families have a lot of boxes to store, and the location mentioned is where they tend to keep them. The options "mail," "shoe store," and "warehouse" do not fit this context, as they are not typically places where families store their possessions. "Cellar" is a possible option, but "basement" is a more common term used for the storage area underneath a house.
Answer:
basement
Question: There are many wage gaps being discussed, the most important of which is between the rich and what?
Options: A) plain, B) sleepy, C) poor, D) idle, E) needy,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wage gap being discussed is between two groups, one of which is the rich, and the other of which is likely to be characterized as having limited financial resources. The word "poor" is the only answer choice that fits this description, and is therefore the correct choice. The other options either have no clear connection to the context of the sentence or describe a state that is not related to financial status.
Answer:

Options: A) michigan, B) computer, C) ocean, D) new york, E) city,
Knowledge: The word "bus" refers to a form of public transportation that is commonly found in urban areas, such as cities. It is unlikely to use a bus to travel to or within a state like Michigan, where driving or taking a train may be more common. The other options, like a computer or ocean, are not related to transportation.
Answer:
city

Options: A) shelf, B) dishwasher, C) table, D) restaurant, E) paper towel,

Answer:
travel
Question: If you are in your house, where is the sunshine likely to come through?
Options: A) windowsill, B) sea, C) disneyland, D) curtain, E) street,
Knowledge: Sunlight typically enters a house through its windows, making the windowsill the most likely answer. The other options (like sea, disneyland or street) do not seem to be related to sunlight entering a house. While curtains can impact the amount of sunlight that enters a room, they are not where the sunlight initially enters.
Answer:
windowsill

Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person is going to watch something in a theater, and doesn't want to get up once they take their seat. This implies that they will be sitting for a while, which is typical behavior when watching a show or movie in a theater setting. The other options don't have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Options: A) imperfect, B) disfigured, C) damaged, D) flawed, E) defective,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the painter struggled to create a perfect portrait, which implies that he perceived the subjects he painted as imperfect in some way. The word "imperfect" describes a subject that has flaws or is not ideal, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options (disfigured, damaged, flawed, defective) all have negative connotations that don't fit the context of the sentence as well, as they suggest a more severe or specific imperfection.
Answer:
imperfect

Options: A) boredom, B) use gas, C) get to work, D) diabetes, E) speeding ticket,

Typically, if someone is driving faster than the speed limit, they are at a risk of getting a speeding ticket, which is a form of fine or penalty imposed for excessive speed while driving. The other options, such as boredom or diabetes, are not related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense in this scenario.
Answer:
speeding ticket
Question: The bird took flight by moving its what?
Options: A) two legs, B) feathers, C) entertain yourself, D) head, E) two wings,
Knowledge: Birds are known for using their wings to fly, while their legs are used for walking or perching. Feathers are used for insulation and aerodynamics during flight, but they do not directly enable the bird to take flight. Similarly, entertaining oneself and moving one's head have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
two wings
Question: He decided to plant tomatoes in a row, where would this row be?
Options: A) auditorium, B) toothrow, C) vegetable garden, D) the porch, E) farmer's field,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the protagonist made a conscious decision to plant a specific type of plant in a designated location, which would likely be a garden.

Options: A) deep south, B) united states, C) 98 of world's crayfish, D) revolutionary war, E) gulf states,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Louisiana was part of a particular region during a historical period, which would narrow down the possible choices. The term "Confederate state" refers specifically to states that seceded from the United States during the Civil War, which occurred in the mid-19th century. The phrase "deep south" is commonly used to refer to the southernmost region of the United States, which includes Louisiana and other states that were part of the Confederacy. The other options are either too general (United States) or unrelated to the context of the sentence (98 of world's crayfish, revolutionary war).
Answer:

The other options, such as fish market or Chinese market, may have food that a crab would enjoy, but they do not specifically pertain to where a crab is likely to find and eat its food. Delicious meal and crabcakes also do not provide any clear indication of a specific location where a crab would enjoy its food.

Question: If I am looking for specialized medical consultation, where do I tend to travel?
Options: A) vermont, B) every state, C) detroit, D) major city, E) urban area,
Knowledge: The use of the word "specialized" suggests that the medical consultation being sought is not a routine service and may require expertise that is not commonly available in all areas.

The other options do not necessarily have a reputation for advanced medical care or access to specialized practitioners.
Answer:

Answer:
university

Options: A) have talent, B) climb stairs, C) in play, D) crawl, E) teach,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that there is a stage that is elevated, which suggests that the only logical option is to climb stairs to reach the stage. Having talent or teaching have no relation to the physical act of accessing an elevated stage, while crawling would not be appropriate for someone who needs to go on stage. In play is also unrelated to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
climb stairs
Question: What do you receive a new credit card in?
Options: A) wallet, B) resturant, C) wallet, D) envelope, E) purse,

The other options are locations or words that do not have any clear connection to car racing, so they can be eliminated.
Answer:
race track

Knowledge: Sloths are known to be arboreal animals that primarily inhabit trees in tropical environments. Tropical jungles are known for their dense vegetation and diverse wildlife, making it an ideal habitat for a variety of animals, including sloths.

Answer:
tropical jungle
Question: A monkey ran through La Defense with classified documents, who was chasing it?
Options: A) monkey, B) rain forest, C) captivity, D) madagascar, E) french government,

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
french government
Question: What could snoring cause in rare cases?
Options: A) complaining, B) an upset partner, C) disturbed sleep, D) loud noise, E) death,
Knowledge: The question asks about rare consequences of snoring, so the answer is unlikely to be something commonly associated with snoring such as complaining or an upset partner. Snoring can cause disturbed sleep and loud noise, but these are not rare consequences. However, in rare cases, snoring can be a symptom of a more serious condition such as sleep apnea, which can cause death if left untreated.
Answer:

Question: The shark was navigating across from the African coast to New York, where was it?
Options: A) bathtub, B) seawater, C) atlantic ocean, D) saltwater, E) sea world,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions the shark navigating from the African coast to New York, which suggests that it was traveling across a large body of water. The options "bathtub" and "sea world" are unrealistic as they do not provide enough space for a shark to navigate through. "Seawater" and "saltwater" are properties of the ocean, but do not provide information about the location. "Atlantic ocean" is the most relevant option as it is a large body of water that connects Africa to the United States, which matches the context of the sentence.
Answer:
atlantic ocean
Question: The planned sky scraper was still years away from completion, but excavation had begun where?
Options: A) cemetary, B) mountain, C) desert, D) construction site, E) archeological site,

The word "excavation" implies that some work is being done at the site to prepare for construction.

The other options - cemetery, mountain, desert, and archeological site - do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not typically associated with building construction.
Answer:
construction site
Question: Why would someone think about getting wet in the summer?
Options: A) cool off, B) to have fun, C) shrinkage, D) shrinking, E) get cold,
Knowledge: Summer is typically associated with hot weather, so if someone is thinking about getting wet during this season, it is likely because they want to cool off. Swimming, water parks, and other water-related activities are popular ways to beat the heat in the summer. The other options, such as shrinking or getting cold, do not make sense in the context of summer and getting wet.
Answer:
cool off
Question: A cat can't talk, but a cat can what?
Options: A) sleep all day, B) meow, C) shed fur, D) see king, E) live many years,
Knowledge: The sentence states that a cat cannot talk, but then suggests that a cat can do something else. One option that cats are well-known for is meowing, which is a sound they use to communicate with humans and other cats. Meowing is a distinctive characteristic of cats and is therefore the correct answer. The other options, while true for cats, do not specifically relate to the sentence's context, making them incorrect answers.
Answer:
meow
Question: The ability to remember things is a sign of what?
Options: A) neuronal network, B) memories, C) intelligence, D) recall, E) learning about,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that remembering things is a characteristic associated with a certain trait. Intelligence is commonly associated with the ability to remember things because it involves having a sharp mind and quick thinking. Neuronal network and memories are more specific and do not have a direct correlation to the sentence. Recall and learning about are more focused on the process of remembering rather than the trait itself.
Answer:
intelligence

Options: A) electrical circuit, B) getting married, C) capital city, D) center of town, E) michigan,

Since courthouses are typically considered central institutions in any town or city, the answer that best fits the context of the sentence is the "center of town." The other options, such as an "electrical circuit," "getting married," "capital city," and "Michigan" do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
center of town

Answer:
sports arena
Question: You think of lower areas when it comes to a valley, but they're usually just a lower spot in a what?
Options: A) continent, B) west virginia, C) peak, D) mountainous region, E) hilly area,
Knowledge: Valleys are typically formed by the erosion or shifting of larger landforms such as mountains or hills. Therefore, it is more likely that a valley would be situated in a mountainous region rather than in a hilly area or a continent. West Virginia may have some mountainous regions, but it is not a general characteristic of the entire state. A peak, on the other hand, refers to the highest point of a mountain and is not usually associated with valleys.
Answer:
mountainous region
Question: What can happen if you're too worn out before going to opera?

Museums are designed to be educational and engaging, so it is common for children to be fascinated by what they see. Crowding and sore feet may be unpleasant experiences in a museum environment, but they are not necessarily specific to children. Being bored and fearful may also occur, but wonder is the most likely and positive experience for a child visiting a museum.
Answer:
wonder
Question: From where can you learn the anatomy of a blowfish?
Options: A) atlantic ocean, B) france, C) fish market, D) books, E) sushi restaurant,
Knowledge: The question is asking about how to learn the anatomy of a blowfish, which suggests that it may be a topic covered in educational resources such as books. While it is possible to observe a blowfish in its natural habitat in the Atlantic Ocean or at a fish market, these options do not necessarily guarantee a thorough understanding of its anatomy. France and sushi restaurants are not relevant to the context of the question. Therefore, books would be the best option for gaining knowledge about the anatomy of a blowfish.
Answer:
books
Question: What does a person do when something is arriving at an undisclosed time?
Options: A) washing dishes, B) wait patiently, C) stand erect, D) cross street, E) waiting room,
Knowledge: The phrase "undisclosed time" suggests that the person does not know when the arrival will happen. Therefore, the only logical choice would be to wait patiently. Washing dishes and standing erect are unrelated to the context of waiting for an arrival. Crossing the street is also unlikely to be the correct answer as it does not involve waiting. Waiting room could be a possible answer, but it is less specific and may not be the best fit depending on the context.
Answer:
wait patiently
Question: Inside what structure do you normally take a bath?
Options: A) room that is upstairs, B) own home, C) hotel room, D) house, E) found in house,

The options "room that is upstairs," "hotel room," and "found in house" are too vague and do not suggest a clear structure type. "Own home" is similar to "house," but could refer to other living arrangements like apartments. "House" is the most accurate answer, as it specifically refers to a type of building where people typically live and have a bathroom for bathing.
Answer:
house
Question: John knew that the snake probably wasn't real because he lived in the Midwest, and anacondas live in what regions?
Options: A) nightmare, B) wyoming, C) tropics, D) ditch, E) pet shops,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that John was able to identify that the snake he encountered was not real based on his knowledge of where anacondas can be found. Anacondas are typically found in tropical regions such as South America, which is likely why John knew that it was unlikely to find one in the Midwest. The other options do not provide any relevant information about anacondas or their habitat.
Answer:
tropics
Question: The hobbit was timid in front of the dragon, but what did he have to be to get the gold?
Options: A) mean, B) aggressive, C) bellicose, D) reckless, E) dauntless,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hobbit was facing a challenge or danger, which required him to possess a certain quality to be able to succeed. The word "timid" implies that he may have lacked courage or confidence initially, but to get the gold, he would need to be bold and fearless, hence the correct answer is "dauntless". The other answer choices have negative connotations, such as being mean or reckless, which are unlikely to be desirable traits in this context.
Answer:
dauntless
Question: What could someone who give assistance help someone else to be?
Options: A) prepared, B) assistant, C) helpful, D) listen, E) help one,
Knowledge: The question asks what someone who gives assistance could help someone else to be. The word "assistance" implies that the helper is providing support or aid to the person being helped. The word "prepared" fits this context, as someone who gives assistance could help another person to be prepared for a task or situation. The other answer choices are either synonyms or related to the concept of assistance, but they do not directly answer the question of what someone who gives assistance could help someone else to be.
Answer:
prepared
Question: What happens to most living things after death but not to mummies?
Options: A) rebirth, B) last forever, C) sadness, D) burial, E) decomposition,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that mummies do not undergo the same process as most other living things after death. Decomposition is a common process that occurs when a living thing dies, but it is unlikely to occur in mummies because they are preserved through various methods. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
decomposition

Options: A) sink, B) glass, C) fly, D) ocean, E) surface of earth,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ship was taking in water, which is a clear sign that it may sink. Glass, fly, ocean, and surface of earth are not connected to the context of the sentence and are therefore not logical choices for the answer.
Answer:
sink

Options: A) having fun, B) jealousy, C) love, D) conflicts, E) friendships,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James likes being around people, but there is something that he doesn't like that may arise from socializing.

The other options, such as having fun, jealousy, love, and friendships, do not necessarily imply negative experiences or conflicts.

Options: A) liquor store, B) church, C) museum, D) spaghetti sauce, E) art show,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is discussing a secret ingredient in a food item being eaten at the table, specifically noodles. As the other options do not involve food or cooking, it can be deduced that the correct answer must be related to food. Additionally, the mention of "wine" as the secret ingredient could indicate that the correct answer involves a savory or Italian cuisine, suggesting that "spaghetti sauce" is the most logical choice.
Answer:
spaghetti sauce
Question: Where is the best place to get cheese?
Options: A) the moon, B) fridge, C) market, D) pizza, E) refrigerator,
Knowledge: Out of all the choices, only "market" is a place where one can reasonably expect to find a variety of different cheeses for sale. "The moon" is obviously not a practical option, "fridge" and "refrigerator" are household appliances rather than locations, and "pizza" is a food item that may or may not happen to have cheese on it. Therefore, the correct answer is "market" as it is the only option that aligns with the question asked.
Answer:
market
Question: A projectile ball is in what after being launched?
Options: A) catapult, B) motion, C) flintlock, D) arcade, E) tennis court,
Knowledge: The word "launched" suggests that the ball was thrown or propelled forward, and it is logical that it would be in motion after being launched. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A catapult is a device used to launch objects, but the sentence suggests that the ball has already been launched. A flintlock is a type of firearm, which does not fit with the description of a projectile ball. Arcade and tennis court are not relevant to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
motion

The phrase "it was who she most" implies that the person in question is particularly important to her, emphasizing the emotional connection. The other options do not fit the emotional tone of the sentence or make logical sense in the context provided.
Answer:
care about

Options: A) make baskets, B) dribbling, C) sweat, D) fall down, E) work together,

"Make baskets" and "dribbling" are actions related to playing basketball, but do not have any connection to clothing. "Fall down" is a possible result of playing basketball, but does not refer to anything specific happening to one's shirt. "Work together" is also not related to the physical aspect of playing basketball.

Options: A) notebook, B) kitchen, C) office suite, D) living room, E) math class,
Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that a divider is being used in a professional setting to create individual workspaces.

Answer:
office suite

Options: A) decision, B) enlightenment, C) new thoughts, D) headaches, E) annurism,
Knowledge: The word "cogitating" means that Billy is thinking deeply or pondering something. The sentence suggests that he will eventually have to make a decision about the situation he is thinking about. The option "enlightenment" may be a possible choice but it is not consistent with the idea of coming to a decision. "New thoughts" and "headaches" are not logical choices, and "annurism" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
decision

Answer:
void
Question: Where must a car park be?
Options: A) city, B) shopping centre, C) downtown, D) outside, E) city center,
Knowledge: The word "park" suggests that this question is asking about where to park a car, not where to find a car. The word "outside" is the only option that makes sense in this context, as car parks are typically located outside of buildings or in designated parking areas on the sides of streets. The other options may have parking areas, but they do not make sense in the context of the question.
Answer:
outside
Question: If you're late getting to work, what is something you experience?
Options: A) promotions, B) malaise, C) bad mood, D) upset, E) stress,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you are late getting to work, you will experience a negative feeling or emotion. The other options, such as promotions and malaise, do not make sense in the context of being late for work. Bad mood and upset are possible options, but stress is the most common and well-known emotion associated with being late for work. Stress is a feeling of pressure or tension that can result from being behind schedule or missing deadlines.
Answer:
stress

Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the focus is on the proper disposal of old newspapers. Recycling is a common and environmentally friendly way to dispose of paper products such as newspapers. The other options aren't related to the proper disposal of old newspapers - "written on paper" refers to the medium used for writing, "informative but often biased" is a description of the content of newspapers, "delivered" refers to the means by which newspapers are distributed, and "printed on paper" is a description of the physical nature of newspapers, but doesn't suggest any particular method of disposal.
Answer:

Options: A) block, B) defend, C) surrender, D) retreat, E) cease fire,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the game involves turns, which suggests that it is some sort of strategy or combat game. The first player attacks, which means that the second player must defend against the attack. Block and defend are similar in meaning, but block may imply a more active action, while defend is more passive. Surrender, retreat, and cease fire all suggest ending the game or giving up, which is not consistent with the context of taking turns and attacking/defending.
Answer:
defend

Options: A) rural area, B) england, C) mountains, D) hen house, E) united states,
Knowledge: The question asks for the country of origin of a fox, which suggests that the fox is a native species of that country.

Options: A) stand together, B) branch out, C) it will give rain, D) produce fruit, E) grow bigger,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trees formed a forest, which is usually defined as a large area covered with trees.

Question: where do women throw loose credit cards?
Options: A) envelope, B) help person track expenses, C) floor, D) wallet, E) purse,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that loose credit cards are being thrown into a container of some sort, and the most likely container for loose credit cards for women would be their purse. Envelopes are usually used to send letters or documents, and are not typically used to store credit cards. While a help person may help someone track expenses, it is unlikely that credit cards would be thrown at them. A floor is not a container and would not be a logical place for storing credit cards. Wallets are typically used to store credit cards, but the context of the sentence suggests that the cards are loose and not organized in a wallet.
Answer:
purse

Answer:
college campus

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the news held a forum to discuss who people would choose for some kind of position or role, but that there was a group of individuals who had not yet made a decision. This group would be called "undecided." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "reject" suggests a negative decision, "predetermination" suggests a decision already made, "force" is not related to decision-making, and "blank" is not commonly used to refer to people who have not made a choice.
Answer:
undecided
Question: What would you put on your foot first before anything else?

Knowledge: This question is asking for the logical sequence of putting something on your foot. The most common item to put on your foot first before anything else is a sock, followed by a shoe. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Fungus is a type of infection that does not belong on your foot, and grave and table are not items that you would put on your foot.
Answer:
sock

Question: Where would you be unlikely to find more than one steak house?
Options: A) nebraska, B) utah, C) new york, D) city, E) strip mall,
Knowledge: The term "steak house" typically refers to a restaurant that specializes in serving steak, which is a type of meat often associated with high-end dining. However, strip malls are known for having a variety of small storefronts that cater to a wide range of consumer needs, often including fast food and casual dining options. Therefore, it is unlikely that a strip mall would have more than one steak house, as it would not necessarily be the ideal location for this type of fine dining establishment to succeed. The other options are all locations where one might reasonably expect to find multiple steak houses, depending on the size of the city or the preferences of the local population.
Answer:
strip mall

A hospital or injured person could refer to a variety of medical situations, not just urgent wounds.

"Battle" is not a medical location, but rather a description of a specific type of conflict.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
cambodia
Question: If a frog has to travel a short distance on land it will do what?
Options: A) walk, B) jump several feet, C) swim, D) hop, E) leap,
Knowledge: Frogs are known to move on land by hopping, which involves pushing off the ground with their back legs and landing on their front legs. Jumping several feet is unlikely since frogs are not capable of sustained flight. Swimming is how frogs move through water, not on land. Leaping is similar to jumping and also unlikely for a short distance. Walking is not a typical form of movement for frogs as their legs are adapted for jumping and hopping in water and on land.
Answer:
hop
Question: A person achieved success and was what by his peers?
Options: A) critical thinking, B) congratulated, C) kick him, D) equal opportunity, E) own house,

Options: A) gear shift, B) wheels, C) garage, D) hardware store, E) motorbike,

The gear shift is a crucial part of the bike that allows the rider to change gears and adjust their speed. If the chain keeps coming off, it's likely that the gear shift is not able to function properly, which would make it difficult to use. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
gear shift

Question: What does someone do before they travel to work?
Options: A) wake up, B) have job, C) message the boss, D) get ready, E) take bus,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is preparing to leave for work, so "get ready" is the most appropriate choice. "Wake up" is too general and could refer to any time of day, "have job" is not an action someone does before leaving for work, "message the boss" is not a common task before leaving for work, and "take bus" may not apply to everyone, as some people might drive or walk to work.

Given the severity of the crime, "jail time" is the most likely outcome. The other options do not provide a logical consequence of committing such a serious offence.
Answer:
jail time
Question: Where is it especially important to keep a dry, clean floor?
Options: A) bed, B) restaurant, C) synagogue, D) wedding, E) all buildings,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that having a dry, clean floor is particularly crucial in one specific type of building. Restaurants are places where food is prepared and served, and any spills or wetness on the floor can pose a safety hazard for both employees and customers. In contrast, places like beds, synagogues, and weddings do not necessarily have the same level of risk associated with a wet or dirty floor. The option "all buildings" is too broad and generalizes the sentence's meaning.
Answer:
restaurant

Answer:
exhilaration

Options: A) full stomach, B) gain energy, C) dieting, D) have energy, E) feeling satisfied,

Answer:
afternoon
Question: Where can someone enjoy ice cream in the dark?
Options: A) party, B) bedroom, C) movie, D) freezer, E) disneyland,
Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking about an activity related to darkness.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Answer:

Question: What public house might you expect to hear someone play the harp?
Options: A) music shop, B) auditorium, C) ochestra, D) concert hall, E) irish bar,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the harp is commonly played at a specific type of establishment. This is likely to be an Irish bar, as the harp is an important symbol of Irish culture and is often associated with traditional Irish music.

Options: A) moving, B) am happy, C) talent, D) partner, E) sitting still,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the subject is referring to someone they worked closely with during the dance competition. Praise for one's own moving abilities, happiness, or talent would not typically be phrased in this way, and sitting still is clearly not relevant to a dance competition.

Options: A) get in shape, B) tiredness, C) sweat, D) diet, E) weight loss,

Weight loss is often a desired outcome of these activities as they can help to burn calories and reduce body fat. Tiredness and sweat may be temporary side effects of exercising, but they do not necessarily indicate a positive outcome. Diet is also important for overall health, but it alone may not result in weight loss without exercise.
Answer:
weight loss
Question: What do you do when you pray, even if you are paralyzed?
Options: A) go to church, B) speak to god, C) praise god, D) kneel, E) sincere,
Knowledge: The question implies that praying is possible even if someone is paralyzed, which means it does not require physical movement. Speaking to god is a common way of communicating with him during prayer, and this would not be impeded by paralysis. Going to church or kneeling both require physical movement, which would be difficult or impossible for someone who is paralyzed. Praise for god and sincere prayers are important components of prayer, but they do not specifically address the issue of paralysis.
Answer:
speak to god

Options: A) irregular, B) elite, C) rare, D) special, E) personal,
Knowledge: The question suggests that the object is not commonly found in a common room, which implies that it may have personal significance or be specific to an individual's taste. The other options do not necessarily imply a personal connection, e.g. rare or elite could refer to an expensive or exclusive object that is not commonly found, but it does not necessarily imply a personal connection.
Answer:
personal

Options: A) chemistry lab, B) atmosphere, C) air, D) supply closet, E) laboratory,
Knowledge: Helium, magnesium, and sulfur are commonly used elements in chemistry experiments and are likely to be found in a chemistry laboratory. The other options such as atmosphere and air are not specific to a school setting, while supply closet and laboratory are too general and could apply to any type of school or workplace.
Answer:
chemistry lab
Question: James went into his office at city hall.  What type of building is this?
Options: A) skyscraper, B) public building, C) tall building, D) work, E) a house,
Knowledge: The sentence specifies that James went into his office at "city hall," which is a public building used for government and administrative purposes. Skyscrapers and tall buildings can also be public buildings, but the sentence does not provide enough information to determine if this is the case. "Work" and "a house" are too general and do not specify the type of building.
Answer:
public building
Question: Where would you put a candle if you wanted it on a wall?
Options: A) shelf, B) birthday cake, C) church, D) floor, E) dark,
Knowledge: The question is asking where you would place a candle if you wanted it on a wall, suggesting that the candle needs to be in a position that is both secure and elevated. A shelf is a logical choice because it can hold the candle securely and is already attached to the wall, making it an easy and safe option. The other options (birthday cake, church, floor, and dark) do not make sense in the context of the question or would not provide a safe or practical location for a candle on a wall.
Answer:
shelf

Options: A) builders, B) architect, C) target, D) tornado, E) tradesmen,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a specific group of people came in to complete the flooring of the building. The term "tradesmen" generally refers to skilled workers who specialize in a particular trade or craft, such as flooring installation. The other options (builders, architect, target, tornado) do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the task of flooring installation.
Answer:
tradesmen

Options: A) earth, B) west, C) asia, D) east, E) southern hemisphere,
Knowledge: The question asks specifically about the location of the Indian Ocean in relation to Africa.

The other choices do not provide any relevant information to help us determine the correct answer.
Answer:
east

Options: A) progress, B) collaboration, C) static, D) coup, E) confusion,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the group's ability to communicate well contributed to the quality of their work. Collaboration is a key component of successful teamwork, and effective communication is essential for collaboration to work. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - progress and static might refer to the group's work output, coup might suggest a sudden achievement or success, and confusion implies a lack of communication or understanding.
Answer:
collaboration
Question: What will you do if you do not turn and you do not move either?
Options: A) twist, B) going straight, C) twist, D) stand still, E) go straight,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is being asked what they will do if they don't turn and don't move. Of the given choices, standing still is the only action that fits this description. Twisting implies a change in direction, and going straight implies movement. Therefore, the correct answer is stand still.
Answer:
stand still

Options: A) person's body, B) brainstem, C) organism, D) turtles, E) fingertips,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a term that applies to all living things that have at least one nerve. The term "organism" refers to any living thing, whether it's an animal, plant, or single-celled organism. The other options are not applicable to all living things as they refer to specific parts or features of the body, or a particular type of animal.
Answer:
organism
Question: People are meeting people, what is the likely physical gesture?
Options: A) introducing yourself, B) smiling, C) shake hands, D) share a hug, E) talking,
Knowledge: When people meet for the first time in a professional or formal setting, it is common to perform a handshake. This gesture indicates a mutual respect and sets the tone for a positive interaction. The other options may also occur during a meeting, but the sentence specifically mentions "meeting" which suggests a greeting or introduction is taking place, making the handshake the most likely option.
Answer:
shake hands
Question: Where can you look up a number to a business when you don't have electricity?
Options: A) power grid, B) equation, C) telephone book, D) math problem, E) roulette wheel,
Knowledge: The question asks where one can look up a number to a business when there is no electricity. This suggests that the answer should not involve electronics or power, ruling out options like power grid and roulette wheel. An equation and math problem are not relevant to looking up phone numbers. A telephone book, however, is a printed directory of phone numbers, making it a reliable source of information when electricity is not available. Therefore, the correct answer is telephone book.
Answer:
telephone book
Question: Like all mammals, cats smell with what?
Options: A) eyes, B) four legs, C) litter of kittens, D) tail, E) nose,

Question: A lot of people who wrestle are very?
Options: A) train yourself, B) have strength, C) choke hold, D) strong, E) take lessons,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that wrestling requires a certain level of physical strength. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "strong." Options such as "train yourself," "take lessons," and "choke hold" may relate to wrestling to some extent, but they don't clearly describe a trait that is commonly associated with people who wrestle. Similarly, while having strength may go hand in hand with wrestling, it doesn't necessarily imply that someone who wrestles is always very strong.
Answer:
strong
Question: Billy was smart but inexperienced.  In many ways he was what?
Options: A) garish, B) bright, C) ignorant, D) make invisible, E) backward,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while Billy had intelligence, he lacked experience in certain areas. "Ignorant" means lacking knowledge or experience in a particular subject, so it would be the most appropriate choice. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "garish" means overly colorful or flashy, "bright" is a synonym of intelligent rather than inexperienced, "make invisible" is not related to Billy's situation, and "backward" suggests a lack of intelligence rather than a lack of experience.
Answer:
ignorant
Question: In a barbershop, what is the most important tool the barber uses?
Options: A) commercial area, B) razor, C) water, D) city, E) scissors,
Knowledge: In a barbershop, a razor is typically the most important tool a barber uses because it is what is used to actually cut the hair. While scissors are also important, they are typically used for more precise cuts and shaping rather than the initial cut. Water may be used to wet the hair or clean the razor, but it is not a tool used for cutting. The other options (commercial area and city) are completely unrelated to the context of the question.
Answer:
razor
Question: The man loved to fish bass, to be happy all he needed was a boat, his equipment, and a what?
Options: A) river, B) freshwater lake, C) sunshine, D) music store, E) live in ponds,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the man loved to fish for bass, which are a type of freshwater fish. This suggests that the man would prefer to fish in a freshwater environment. The other options, such as river or live in ponds, may also offer freshwater environments but are not specific to the type of fish the man loves to catch. Additionally, the sentence suggests that the man needs a boat and equipment, which are typically used in larger bodies of water such as lakes. The option of sunshine or music store does not have any clear connection to fishing.
Answer:
freshwater lake
Question: The person was trying to describe what makes a good movie, he liked all the little what?
Options: A) mice, B) go home, C) details, D) witty, E) headache,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is describing what makes a good movie and that they appreciate "little" things. This implies that they value attention to detail, which is important in creating a high-quality film. The other options, such as "mice," "go home," "witty," and "headache," do not make sense in the context of describing what makes a good movie.
Answer:
details
Question: A battleship is a powerful vessel.  If you need something similar but faster, what would you use?
Options: A) yatch, B) corvette, C) aircraft carrier, D) destroyer, E) patrol boat,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a similarly powerful vessel but faster, which rules out options like patrol boats or yachts which are not designed for speed or strength. An aircraft carrier and a destroyer are both larger and more powerful than a battleship, with different functions and purposes. A corvette, on the other hand, is a smaller, swift military vessel designed for speed, agility, and firepower, making it a suitable option for someone looking for a faster alternative to a battleship.
Answer:
corvette
Question: The toilet were somewhat built into the suits of the zero gravity travelers on the what?
Options: A) aircraft, B) space shuttle, C) stadium, D) restaurant, E) bathroom,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the toilet was built into a suit used by zero gravity travelers, which implies that the travelers were in space. The context of the sentence implies that this was a particular type of vehicle or mode of transportation, which makes the options of aircraft, stadium, and restaurant less likely choices. The word "toilet" also suggests a limited range of options, and the presence of "shuttle" in the phrase "space shuttle" makes it the most logical choice.
Answer:
space shuttle
Question: What could cause you to not be sleeping well?
Options: A) being at a party, B) relaxation, C) have fun, D) death, E) nightmares,
Knowledge: The other options in the list do not specifically indicate a problem with sleeping, whereas nightmares are commonly associated with disrupting sleep patterns. While being at a party or having fun might lead to a lack of sleep in some cases, these options are not specific enough to be the correct answer to this question. Death and relaxation may or may not have an impact on sleep, and would depend on the individual and their circumstances.
Answer:
nightmares
Question: Sarah wasn't a good person. She was always away, always busy, never there.  Her wife wanted her to be more what?
Options: A) available, B) come back, C) closer, D) stay here, E) pay debts,

Answer:
available
Question: The small dog had died and, the family treasured him a lot, where did they decide to place it?
Options: A) coffin, B) denmark, C) bucket, D) basket, E) new hampshire,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the family had a lot of love and affection for their pet dog, so it is likely that they would have given it a proper funeral or burial. The option "coffin" is the most appropriate choice for this, as it is a container used for laying a body to rest. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
coffin
Question: He had chosen to live a fulfilling life, he was content in the end and died with no regrets as he took his last what?
Options: A) read book, B) go to school, C) breathing, D) breathe, E) journey,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question had lived a fulfilling life and was content at the end, implying that they had accomplished their goals and were at peace with their life. The phrase "died with no regrets" further emphasizes this idea. The last thing that the person did was to take their last breath, indicated by the phrase "as he took his last." The other options - reading a book, going to school, or embarking on a journey - do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the person's contentment or the idea of dying with no regrets.
Answer:
breathe
Question: A continent is a large area of land, but the globe is mostly covered by an what?
Options: A) ocean, B) australia, C) asia, D) continent, E) island,
Knowledge: The sentence establishes that a continent is a large area of land, but then contrasts this with what the globe is mostly covered by. The most common answer to this would be an ocean, as oceans cover roughly 71% of the Earth's surface. The other options, while all related to geography in some way, do not make sense in this context - for example, Australia is a continent but not the answer we're looking for here.
Answer:
ocean
Question: When camping a home base is what?
Options: A) camping in the to and acid is it is not suitable, B) likeable, C) desirable, D) admirable, E) top,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having a home base when camping is important or beneficial. The word "base" implies a central location or starting point, and having a designated place to return to while camping can make the experience more comfortable and organized. The other options do not make sense in the context of camping or having a home base.
Answer:
desirable
Question: As the fox ran into the forest it disappeared into the what?
Options: A) nantucket, B) barn, C) northern hemisphere, D) hen house, E) undergrowth,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the fox ran into a forest and disappeared, suggesting that it was able to conceal itself among the plants and foliage. "Undergrowth" refers to the shrubs and small trees that grow beneath the larger trees in a forest, providing cover for animals like foxes. The other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not related to the landscape or the behavior of the fox.
Answer:
undergrowth
Question: John lives in a farhouse well away from anyone. He doesn't farm himself, the farm shut down long ago.  How would you describe the area where he lives?
Options: A) farming community, B) rural area, C) cow's shed, D) michigan, E) housing farmer and family,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John lives in a remote and isolated location where farming is no longer a prominent activity. This description matches the characteristics of a rural area, which is typically an area that is sparsely populated and dominated by agricultural or natural landscapes. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as they either describe a specific type of building or location or do not meet the criteria of being remote and without farming activity.
Answer:
rural area
Question: Why do people participate in exercising?
Options: A) tiredness, B) exhaustion, C) get sick, D) become stronger, E) use energy,
Knowledge: Exercise is commonly associated with building strength and improving overall physical fitness. The other options, such as tiredness, exhaustion, getting sick, or using energy, do not directly relate to the benefits of exercise. In fact, exercising can actually help combat fatigue and increase energy levels. Therefore, the most logical answer is that people participate in exercising to become stronger and healthier.
Answer:
become stronger
Question: What about you will decrease after you exercise for many months?
Options: A) work out, B) blood, C) expend energy, D) stretch, E) weigh,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exercising for many months will cause a decrease in something, which is most likely a physical change in the body. The term "weigh" is the only option that specifically refers to a physical measurement of the body, while the other options have more general or nebulous meanings. "Stretch" and "work out" may actually increase rather than decrease with exercise, while "expend energy" and "blood" are not necessarily associated with a change in weight.
Answer:
weigh
Question: She had worked hard her whole life saving money, featuring her dream entrance hall she bought a new what?
Options: A) hat rack, B) school, C) large home, D) palace, E) gateway,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person has saved up enough money to buy something significant. The mention of a dream entrance hall suggests that the purchase is related to a dwelling place and the use of the word "bought" indicates a purchase. "Hat rack" and "school" do not fit the context of purchasing a large home, while "palace" seems too grandiose for the given information. "Gateway" is also unlikely since it does not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
large home
Question: The friends gathered around the table to play cards and what?
Options: A) drink, B) have fun, C) remember, D) bored, E) good at,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the friends gathered to engage in an enjoyable activity, which is commonly associated with playing cards. The phrase "have fun" is also often used in reference to social gatherings, which further supports this answer choice. The other options are not consistent with the context of the sentence; for example, there is no indication that the friends were drinking alcohol or feeling bored.
Answer:
have fun
Question: WHat could prevent someone from the ability to buy a house?
Options: A) bargain, B) pay for, C) settle down, D) lose money, E) too far away,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a factor that could prevent someone from being able to buy a house. Losing money is a common reason for many people not being able to afford a home. This might be due to a job loss, unexpected expenses or debt payment obligations. Bargaining, paying for, settling down or distance do not seem to imply a lack of affordability for buying a house.
Answer:
lose money
Question: What will someone do in the house in the evening because of being hungry?
Options: A) make bread, B) have lunch, C) eat in restaurant, D) cook dinner, E) school,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is hungry in the evening, which is typically a time when people eat dinner. The phrase "cook dinner" specifically refers to the action of preparing a meal at home, which is a common activity for people who are hungry in the evening. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either refer to meals at different times of day or involve going outside of the house to eat.
Answer:
cook dinner
Question: What can an injury cause that is messy?
Options: A) cause bleeding, B) become infected, C) distress, D) cause death, E) hurts,
Knowledge: The word "messy" suggests that the injury can cause some sort of bodily fluid or substance to be present, which would be the case with bleeding. Infections and distress may not necessarily be messy, and while death may result from an injury, the term "messy" does not necessarily describe the outcome. "Hurts" is too general and could apply to any injury, but it does not necessarily imply messiness.
Answer:
cause bleeding
Question: If you're typing for a long time, what's a sign you should take a break?
Options: A) pain, B) carpal tunnel syndrome, C) letter, D) thirst, E) printed word,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that typing for a long time can be physically demanding and potentially harmful. Pain is a common signal from the body indicating that it is under stress or strain, and thus taking a break is necessary. Carpal tunnel syndrome is also a potential health risk associated with typing and can cause pain, but it is a specific medical condition rather than a general sign one should take a break. Letter, thirst, and printed word are not related to the physical stress associated with typing.
Answer:
pain
Question: Where are trees likely to line a road?
Options: A) countryside, B) state park, C) forest, D) garden, E) yard,
Knowledge: Trees are often planted along rural roads, especially those located in the countryside, to provide shade and create a pleasing aesthetic. State parks and forests may also have trees lining the roads, but the context of the question implies a more common occurrence, which favors the countryside option. Gardens and yards may have trees, but they are not typically planted along roadsides.
Answer:
countryside
Question: What is someone having a hard time learning abut science likely to experience?
Options: A) smiles, B) frustration, C) accidents, D) become happy, E) experiment,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone is struggling to learn about science, which suggests that they may feel frustrated. Learning can be a difficult process, and science is a complex subject that requires a lot of effort and dedication to master. Smiling or becoming happy may be unlikely responses to struggling with science, while accidents and experimentation are not related to the emotional experience of learning.
Answer:
frustration
Question: If you are prescribed an antibiotic by your doctor, where would you go to get it?
Options: A) doctor, B) prescribed, C) pharmacy, D) medicine cabinet, E) capsule,
Knowledge: When a doctor prescribes medication, it means they are recommending a specific type and dosage of medication for a patient's health condition. Antibiotics are a type of medication that can only be obtained with a prescription. Therefore, the patient would need to take the prescription to a pharmacy where a licensed pharmacist would dispense the medication. The other options do not accurately reflect the proper process of obtaining a prescription antibiotic.
Answer:
pharmacy
Question: John refused to sleep because of Freddy.   Nothing can hurt you as long as you do what?
Options: A) vacuuming, B) being awake, C) wakefulness, D) stay awake, E) entertainment,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is afraid of something that may harm him while he is sleeping, so he chooses to stay awake instead. The phrase "nothing can hurt you" implies that staying awake is seen as a way of protecting oneself from harm. The other options do not reflect the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
Answer:
stay awake
Question: Many grains of sand together form what?
Options: A) eye, B) bathing suit, C) sand pile, D) clam, E) create pearl,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are many grains of sand being referred to, which when put together, form something. The only option that matches this description is "sand pile." The other options, such as "eye," "bathing suit," "clam," and "create pearl," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
sand pile
Question: John walked into the courtyard of a famous palace.  Where might he be?
Options: A) spain, B) versailles, C) courtroom, D) office complex, E) lawn,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John may be in a palace, which immediately rules out options such as a courtroom or office complex. The mention of a courtyard and a famous palace suggests that the location may be a historical landmark or tourist attraction. Spain, while it does have many famous palaces, is a broad option and therefore less likely to be the correct answer. Finally, the option "lawn" is clearly not the correct answer as it does not fit with the context of the sentence. This leaves "versailles" as the most likely option since it is known as a famous palace with a well-known courtyard.
Answer:
versailles
Question: Animals do what from birth to death?
Options: A) fight each other, B) need to eat, C) drink water, D) live lives, E) feel pain,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the topic is the entire life cycle of animals. The other options are only specific actions that animals may do during their lives, while "live lives" encompasses their entire existence. It is also a basic fact that animals are born and then live until they die, which further supports the correct answer.
Answer:
live lives
Question: The employee was stocking product, where did he put it?
Options: A) display case, B) demonstration, C) market, D) store, E) shelf,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the employee was stocking a product, which typically involves placing it on a designated surface for customers to access. In a store setting, products are often stocked on shelves, making it the most likely option in this context. The other choices, such as display case and demonstration, do not fit the typical method of stocking a product in a retail setting. Market and store are too general and do not provide enough specific information to help make a choice.
Answer:
shelf
Question: Where can you take your automobile to go as fast as you can?
Options: A) garage, B) parkling lot, C) freeway, D) racetrack, E) side of road,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is asking about a place where they can drive their car at high speeds. A racetrack is a common place for car racing or high-performance driving, where drivers can push their cars to their limits in a controlled environment. The other options do not provide a suitable location for high-speed driving. A garage or parking lot are confined spaces, while a freeway and side of the road have speed limits and regulations that prohibit reckless driving.
Answer:
racetrack
Question: What is a place that has only one ceiling and which could be on ground level?
Options: A) house, B) building, C) loft, D) classroom, E) airplane,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a place with a single ceiling that can also be located on the ground level. This rules out options such as airplanes, which have multiple levels and are not on the ground, and lofts, which are typically located aboveground. A house or building may have multiple ceilings, so those options can also be eliminated. A classroom, on the other hand, typically has a single ceiling and can be located on the ground level, making it the correct answer.
Answer:
classroom
Question: What could happen if something surprising happens while you are driving?
Options: A) faint, B) accidents, C) frightened, D) laughter, E) funny,
Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of a surprising event occurring while driving. One possible consequence is that it could lead to accidents, as unexpected events can cause drivers to lose control of their vehicles or collide with other cars. Fainting, being frightened or laughing do not seem to be appropriate responses to the situation, and "funny" is not a suitable answer in this context, as the question implies a potentially dangerous or serious scenario.
Answer:
accidents
Question: What is the result of reaching a tentative agreement?
Options: A) communicate with, B) settlement, C) shake hands, D) celebration, E) part ways,
Knowledge: A tentative agreement usually means that parties involved have come to an understanding, but are not yet fully committed. A settlement, on the other hand, means that the agreement has been finalized and legally binding. The other choices, such as communication or celebration, do not necessarily indicate a finalized agreement. Parting ways also suggests that the negotiation did not reach a successful conclusion. Shaking hands may symbolize agreement, but it does not necessarily mean that a final decision has been reached.
Answer:
settlement
Question: What else might one feel when hurting?
Options: A) death, B) feel sad, C) more hurt, D) punishment, E) accident,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hurting is associated with an emotional response, which is likely to be negative since the choices include "death," "punishment," and "accident." "More hurt" is also a possible response to hurting, but it is not a valid answer to the question because it is a physical response rather than an emotional one. "Feel sad" is the most appropriate answer because it aligns with the emotional connotations of the sentence.
Answer:
feel sad
Question: If diamonds are not free nor cheap, what are they?
Options: A) enslaved, B) free with coupon., C) expensive, D) paid for, E) imprisoned,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that diamonds have a high value because they are neither free nor cheap. The term "expensive" is commonly associated with objects that have a high monetary value. The other options, such as enslaved or imprisoned, do not make sense in the context of a discussion about the price of diamonds.
Answer:
expensive
Question: When making a chicken salad, how is the chicken made to be in smaller pieces?
Options: A) baked in oven, B) chopped, C) bought at store, D) cooked by grilling, E) eaten,
Knowledge: When making chicken salad, the chicken is typically cooked first and then chopped or shredded into smaller pieces before being mixed with the other ingredients. Baking, grilling, or buying pre-cooked chicken at the store would not necessarily result in the chicken being in smaller pieces. "Eaten" is not a method of preparing the chicken. Therefore, "chopped" is the most likely correct answer.
Answer:
chopped
Question: What do you need to do to keep a surprise party a surprise?
Options: A) keep secret, B) laugh, C) enjoy, D) scare, E) send flowers,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to keep a surprise party a surprise, one needs to do something specific. To keep a surprise party a surprise, one must keep the fact that there is a party a secret from the person who is being surprised. The other options are not related to keeping a surprise party a surprise in any way.
Answer:
keep secret
Question: Fighting inflation means being aware of many things, such as what with loans?
Options: A) not noticeable, B) loss of money, C) economic instability, D) rising interest rates, E) problems,
Knowledge: Inflation is often accompanied by rising prices, which can lead to an increase in interest rates. This is because the central bank may raise interest rates to control inflation by reducing the amount of money in circulation. A higher interest rate makes borrowing more expensive, which can help to curb spending and reduce inflation. Therefore, being aware of rising interest rates is important when fighting inflation. The other options do not have a clear connection to inflation and loans.
Answer:
rising interest rates

Answer:
injuries
Question: Where would you get a dog if you do not have one?
Options: A) pet store, B) outside, C) neighbor's house, D) park, E) rug,
Knowledge: Pet stores are well-known for selling pets, including dogs, so this choice would make the most sense in the context of the question. The other options, such as outside, neighbor's house, park, and rug, do not provide any clear indication of where one would obtain a dog.
Answer:
pet store
Question: Where could you find passengers that are planning to travel to another continent?
Options: A) car, B) bus depot, C) bus stop, D) library, E) airport,
Knowledge: Passengers who are planning to travel to another continent are most likely to be found at an airport.

Question: Where might a person store an antibiotic to keep it out of the reach of children?
Options: A) stomach, B) pharmacy, C) prescribed, D) medicine cabinet, E) capsule,

A medicine cabinet is a common location for storing medications that need to be kept out of reach of children. Storing the antibiotic in the stomach or a capsule does not make sense as these are not storage locations, and being prescribed or coming from a pharmacy does not provide any information about where to store the medication.
Answer:
medicine cabinet
Question: When you shake a can of spray paint you'll hear a bead do what?
Options: A) nod, B) stay still, C) rattle, D) be still, E) stir,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that when a can of spray paint is shaken, there is a sound or movement that occurs. The word "rattle" implies a shaking or clanking noise, which is a common characteristic of a can of spray paint being shaken. The other options do not accurately describe the expected result of shaking a can of spray paint.
Answer:
rattle
Question: The glass bottle ha a symbol on the bottom.  This symbol told customers what about the bottle?
Options: A) combustible, B) dirty, C) clear, D) very fragile, E) recyclable,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the symbol on the bottom of the glass bottle is related to its properties or intended use. The options "combustible," "dirty," and "very fragile" do not seem relevant in this context, while "clear" is a characteristic of glass that does not require a symbol to indicate it. Therefore, it is likely that the symbol indicates that the bottle can be recycled, which is a common practice for glass containers.
Answer:
recyclable
Question: What would you be doing if you are having lunch?
Options: A) eating, B) hunger, C) burp, D) laughing, E) food,
Knowledge: The question is asking about an action that is typically associated with having lunch. Eating is the most logical choice as it is the main activity that usually takes place during a meal. Hunger is a sensation that someone might experience before or after lunch, but it is not an action. Burping and laughing are unrelated to the act of having lunch, while food is a broad category that could refer to any aspect of a meal.
Answer:
eating
Question: Where does a plane go when it has reached its destination?
Options: A) air, B) eat, C) sky, D) runway, E) fall,
Knowledge: When a plane reaches its destination, it must land on a runway. The runway is specifically designed for planes to take off and land safely. The other options do not make sense in the context of a plane reaching its destination. The plane may be in the air during flight, but it must eventually land on the runway. "Eat" and "fall" are not relevant to the question.
Answer:
runway
Question: Where are you likely to to find a marmot other than the zoo?
Options: A) wilderness, B) south america, C) jungle, D) in its den., E) new zealand,
Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions and are known to burrow in the ground or rocks. Therefore, the option "wilderness" seems like the most appropriate choice as it is a vast area of undeveloped land with diverse terrain and vegetation which can provide a suitable habitat for marmots to thrive. The other options such as "jungle" or "new zealand" do not align with the natural habitat of marmots.
Answer:
wilderness
Question: What would be a cheap way for a medieval family to satisfy their hunger?
Options: A) go to the store, B) make bread, C) bring home fish, D) go to market, E) eat hamburger,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a cheap way for a medieval family to satisfy their hunger, which suggests that they may not have had access to a lot of money or resources. Making bread is a simple and inexpensive way to feed a family, as it only requires basic ingredients like flour, water, yeast, and salt. Going to the store, going to the market, or bringing home fish may not have been viable options for a medieval family depending on their location, income, and availability of resources. Eating a hamburger is not a plausible option because hamburgers did not exist during medieval times.
Answer:
make bread
Question: Where do you originally get kleenex from?
Options: A) wipe nose, B) blow nose, C) box, D) purse, E) pocket,
Knowledge: Kleenex is a brand name of facial tissue typically used for wiping or blowing one's nose. While it is possible to carry individual tissues in a purse or pocket, the question specifically asks about where Kleenex is originally obtained from. The most common way to obtain Kleenex is by purchasing a box of tissues from a store or supermarket.
Answer:
box
Question: Bill loved riding his bike and did it all the time.  He had trouble going up hills and sometimes pushed himself to the point of what?
Options: A) falling down, B) give up, C) exhaustion, D) travelling, E) going somewhere,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill struggles with riding his bike uphill, indicating that it requires a significant amount of physical exertion. The phrase "pushed himself to the point of" implies that Bill's physical activity was so strenuous that it caused him to experience a negative consequence. "Exhaustion" is the only choice that accurately reflects the consequences of over-exertion, while "falling down", "give up", "travelling", and "going somewhere" do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
exhaustion
Question: When you play chess and work hard to improve at it, and finally have it pay off you will feel what?
Options: A) smart, B) have fun, C) made, D) satisfaction, E) superior,
Knowledge: The question suggests that the feeling one experiences after working hard to improve at chess and succeeding is related to a sense of achievement or fulfillment. The choice "satisfaction" best captures this idea. "Smart" may be a feeling one experiences after successfully solving a challenging problem or learning something new, but it is not necessarily the feeling associated with improving at chess. "Have fun" is not the most fitting choice as it does not reflect the idea of hard work paying off. "Made" is not a feeling, it is a verb. "Superior" is not the most fitting choice as it implies a sense of dominance or superiority over others, which may not be the case in this scenario.
Answer:
satisfaction
Question: There are usually four strings on what popular instrument?
Options: A) trumpet, B) kite, C) quark, D) guitar, E) bird's nest,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the instrument in question is a popular one and usually has four strings. The options trumpet, kite, quark, and bird's nest are either not instruments or do not have the characteristic of having four strings. The guitar, on the other hand, is a popular instrument that typically has four strings, making it the correct answer.
Answer:
guitar
Question: Your oven is most likely found where?
Options: A) restaurant, B) prison, C) school, D) own home, E) pizza place,
Knowledge: The options include different types of establishments, but the sentence suggests that the subject is referring to their personal oven. It is unlikely that a person would have access to an oven in a prison, school or restaurant setting, and while there may be ovens in pizza places, the most common place for an individual to have an oven is in their own home.
Answer:
own home
Question: What is someone likely to feel after killing someone?
Options: A) horrible, B) funeral, C) remorse, D) going to jail, E) scared,
Knowledge: Killing someone is a serious act that often elicits strong emotions. While it is possible that someone may feel scared or worried about getting caught and going to jail, the term "remorse" specifically refers to a feeling of deep regret or guilt about a past action, which is more likely to apply to someone who has taken another person's life. The term "horrible" is also associated with negative emotions, but it is not specific enough to the context of the question. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential emotional response to killing someone.
Answer:
remorse
Question: When competing against a fighter with better training you'll likely get a what?

Question: What does hurting someone else cause?
Options: A) punishment, B) anger, C) arrested, D) suffering, E) hatred,
Knowledge: The question is asking for the result or consequence of hurting someone else. "Suffering" is a logical choice because it describes the pain or distress that the person who was hurt is likely to experience. The other options do not adequately capture the consequence of causing harm to another person. "Punishment" and "arrested" may be consequences from a legal or social perspective, but they do not necessarily describe the emotional or physical result of being hurt. "Anger" and "hatred" may be emotions that the injured party may feel, but they do not describe the physical or emotional pain that results from being hurt.
Answer:
suffering
Question: If you're standing in front of people holding index cards what are you likely doing?
Options: A) learning, B) oral report, C) office supply store, D) card catalogue, E) library,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is standing in front of people while holding index cards. This is a common practice during giving an oral report or presentation. The use of index cards can help the speaker remember important points and stay organized while delivering a speech. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
oral report
Question: A bugle sounded every morning where?
Options: A) music store, B) army corps, C) army, D) military band, E) military base,
Knowledge: The word "bugle" is often associated with military and is typically used to signal specific events, such as reveille in the morning. In this context, the sentence suggests that a bugle sounded every morning at a location related to military operations or training. The other answer choices do not make sense in this context.
Answer:
military base
Question: Where can someone level up?
Options: A) video game, B) garage, C) food court, D) carpenter's shop, E) building,
Knowledge: The term "level up" is commonly associated with video games, where players progress through different levels of difficulty as they gain experience points. The other options do not have any clear connection to the concept of leveling up. A garage, food court, carpenter's shop, or building may have different purposes but do not relate to the gaming context.
Answer:
video game
Question: Where can birds clean themselves?
Options: A) outside, B) nest, C) birdhouse, D) roof, E) water fountain,
Knowledge: Birds typically clean themselves by bathing in water, either in natural bodies of water, such as rivers or ponds, or in man-made structures like bird baths or water fountains. The other options do not involve water or a place where birds could bathe. Nest is where they live, outside is too general, birdhouse is where they rest, and roof doesn't involve any water source for bird cleaning.
Answer:
water fountain
Question: In the video game he used the rocket launcher at long range, but up close he would switch to the rapid fire what?
Options: A) pistol, B) assault rifle, C) submachine gun, D) grenade launcher, E) shotgun,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the player in the video game preferred to use the rocket launcher from a distance, indicating that the weapon was best suited for long-range combat. However, when the player was up close, they switched to a weapon with a fast firing rate, suggesting that they needed to take out enemies quickly. The assault rifle, submachine gun, and shotgun all have rapid fire capabilities, but the shotgun is typically used for close-range combat, making it an unlikely choice. The pistol and grenade launcher do not have the rapid firing capabilities suggested in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is submachine gun.
Answer:
submachine gun
Question: I was creating art while angry, what did my painting convey inadvertently?
Options: A) work of art, B) feeling of accomplishment, C) making love, D) pleasure, E) strong emotion,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the painting was created while the person was feeling angry, which is likely to have influenced the resulting artwork. Anger is a strong emotion, and it is likely that the painting conveyed this emotion inadvertently. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence - while creating art can be a work of art, a feeling of accomplishment or pleasure, these options do not connect with the fact that the creator was angry while making it. Making love is also a completely unrelated option that does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
strong emotion
Question: Who takes forever to pass a bill?
Options: A) congress, B) wallet, C) restaurant, D) mail box, E) presidents,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that passing a bill is a slow and tedious process, which is commonly associated with the US Congress. The US Congress is responsible for passing bills into law, and the process often involves long debates, negotiations, and revisions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
congress

Question: Jim chose clear paint.  He could have chosen another type but it would have covered up the natural beauty of the wood.  What sort of paint could he have chosen instead?
Options: A) opaque, B) opal, C) obscured, D) obscure, E) thick,
Knowledge: The context suggests that the paint that Jim considered using would have covered up the natural beauty of the wood. This implies that the paint is not transparent and therefore, opaque would be the best answer. Opal refers to a type of gemstone and does not make sense in this context. Obscured and obscure mean to make unclear or difficult to understand, and thick does not necessarily imply that the paint would cover up the natural beauty of the wood.
Answer:
opaque
Question: He was washing hands, what happened to his hands as a result?
Options: A) jazz hands, B) health, C) become wet, D) skin irritation, E) dry skin,
Knowledge: The sentence states that the person was washing their hands, which implies that their hands became wet as a result. The other options do not make sense in the context of washing hands. "Jazz hands" is a type of dance move and has nothing to do with washing hands. "Health" is a broad and vague option that does not provide enough context to make sense as an answer choice. "Skin irritation" and "dry skin" may be possible outcomes of washing hands with harsh soaps or chemicals, but the sentence does not provide any indication that this is what happened.
Answer:
become wet
Question: The muscle stretched, and after it did what?
Options: A) popped, B) loose, C) compressing, D) contract, E) cramped,
Knowledge: The sentence describes a muscle, and the word "stretched" implies that it was previously extended or lengthened. In this context, when a muscle "contracts," it means that it is shortening and tightening back up again. This is a normal and healthy response to stretching, as it helps to strengthen the muscle and improve its flexibility. The other options do not fit with what typically happens to a muscle after it has been stretched.
Answer:
contract
Question: Why would someone fail after giving an answer?
Options: A) problem, B) question, C) wrong, D) ask, E) swear,
Knowledge: In this context, "fail after giving an answer" suggests that the person's answer was incorrect. "Wrong" is the most logical choice, as it directly relates to giving an incorrect answer. "Problem" and "question" are too general and don't necessarily imply an incorrect answer. "Ask" and "swear" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
wrong
Question: The drunk man was hitting bottle figuratively and literally when he slammed it down on the what?
Options: A) buying beer, B) ticket, C) aim, D) table, E) breaking,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the drunk man was angry or frustrated, and he expressed this emotion by slamming a bottle down on something. The most logical option is the table, as it is a common object that can be found near someone who is drinking. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence; buying beer and getting a ticket are unrelated to the man's behavior, aim is not a tangible object, and breaking is a consequence of the man's action rather than the target of it.
Answer:
table
Question: If a human wants to be in a warm place, where is a good place to be?
Options: A) battle, B) doctor, C) mexico, D) workplace, E) in the fridge,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the human wants to be in a warm place, which eliminates options like "in the fridge." The context of the question further suggests that the choice should be a location rather than a profession, which eliminates options like "doctor" and "workplace." The remaining option that fits the context is "mexico," as it is a country with a warm climate.
Answer:
mexico
Question: Where would you find people who work with a round brush?
Options: A) art supplies, B) ladies bathroom, C) shower, D) hair salon, E) make person sick,
Knowledge: Round brushes are commonly used in the hair salon industry for styling and blow-drying hair. The other options do not have any clear connection to the use of round brushes.
Answer:

Options: A) warm air, B) stay alive, C) calmness, D) living, E) relaxation,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the exercise involved deep and slow breathing, which is a common technique used to promote relaxation and reduce stress. Other options, such as warm air, staying alive, or living, do not seem to be related to the context of the sentence. Calmness is a possible alternative, but relaxation is a more specific and commonly used term for the desired outcome of breathing exercises.
Answer:
relaxation
Question: What can be used to carry a small dog?
Options: A) swimming pool, B) basket, C) dog show, D) backyard, E) own home,
Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about something that can be used to carry a small dog, so options like swimming pool, dog show, backyard, and own home do not make logical sense. A basket, however, is often used to transport small animals, and would be a reasonable choice for carrying a small dog.
Answer:
basket
Question: Where are files likely to be hanging?
Options: A) filing cabinet, B) tree, C) suitcase, D) computer, E) desk drawer,
Knowledge: The word "hanging" suggests that the files are being stored vertically rather than horizontally. The only option that allows for vertical storage is the filing cabinet. The other options - tree, suitcase, computer, and desk drawer - do not typically involve files being stored in a vertical position.
Answer:
filing cabinet

Options: A) bleeding, B) imprisonment, C) mess, D) killing, E) give up,

Options: A) ocean's eleven, B) ocean floor, C) downtown area, D) high school, E) container,

Answer:
ocean floor
Question: If people are at war with one another, what might they do as a consequence?
Options: A) destroy each other, B) interact, C) talk to each other, D) run amok, E) desire to win,
Knowledge: The phrase "at war with one another" implies a violent conflict, which often leads to actions such as destruction and aggression. "Interact" and "talk to each other" are not likely scenarios in the context of war, as the parties involved are typically not in a position to negotiate or communicate effectively. "Run amok" is a vague term that does not provide enough context to indicate a logical consequence of war. "Desire to win" is a general statement that could apply to many situations, but it does not specifically address the consequences of war.
Answer:
destroy each other
Question: The local place didn't have the variety the customer was after, so he traveled to see the show room in the big what?
Options: A) dancehall, B) car dealership, C) theater, D) city, E) vegas,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the customer was looking for a larger selection or more options than what was available locally, and this implies that the customer was looking for a bigger selection offered in a more populous area. The urban connotation of "city" fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options have limited relevance to the context, as a dancehall and theater refer to specific types of buildings, a car dealership refers to a specific type of business, and Vegas, short for Las Vegas, would not be considered a local place for most people.
Answer:
city
Question: What might happen to someone if they were found guilty of committing perjury?
Options: A) embarrassment, B) mistrial, C) going to jail, D) laywer, E) tension,
Knowledge: Perjury is a serious crime that involves lying under oath in a legal setting. If someone is found guilty of committing perjury, they may face legal consequences such as fines, probation, or even imprisonment. Going to jail is a common punishment for this offense. Embarrassment and tension may also be feelings that someone experiences in relation to committing perjury, but they are not legal consequences. Mistrial is also not a direct consequence of perjury, but rather a legal decision to invalidate a trial due to some other issue. A lawyer is not a consequence, but rather someone who may be involved in defending or prosecuting a case involving perjury.
Answer:
going to jail
Question: The couple had a forgiving attitude with each other thereafter, what did they do?
Options: A) great relief, B) feel better, C) respect, D) go up high, E) make up,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple had a conflict or disagreement, but were able to move past it with a forgiving attitude. "Make up" is a common expression used to describe the act of resolving a disagreement and becoming friends again. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: He bought a warranty for the fragile objects just it case they what?
Options: A) sound well, B) become broken, C) patch up, D) disappear from sight, E) gain speed,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the warranty was purchased as a precautionary measure for fragile objects. Fragile objects are prone to breaking, and the purpose of a warranty is typically to provide coverage in case of damage or defects. Therefore, the correct answer is "become broken." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
become broken
Question: As you live life you get wiser, it is a part of what?
Options: A) growing older, B) death, C) experience things, D) toothsome, E) breathe,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that wisdom is acquired over time, which implies that the person is aging and accumulating life experience. The phrase "as you live life" also supports this idea. The other options, such as toothsome and breathe, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
growing older
Question: Ballet dancing is a form of artistic what?
Options: A) swan lake, B) intercourse, C) expression, D) become tired, E) fatigue,
Knowledge: Ballet dancing is a form of artistic expression, where dancers use their bodies to convey emotions, tell stories, and express themselves. Swan Lake is a famous ballet, but it is not a broader category that could be used to describe ballet dancing as a whole. Intercourse and fatigue have no connection to ballet dancing or artistic expression, and "become tired" is not a category that could be used to describe any form of dance.
Answer:
expression
Question: John heard loud noise coming from below him, which was perfectly normal.   It always happened this time of day.  He really hated living here.  Where did he live?
Options: A) upstream, B) roof, C) aloft, D) upstairs, E) upwards,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John heard a loud noise coming from below him, indicating that he is living in a multi-level building. The phrase "perfectly normal" suggests that the noise is a regular occurrence, and it happens at a specific time of the day. The phrase "he really hated living here" implies that John is not happy with his living situation. Based on these clues, the correct answer is "upstairs," as it is the only option that is related to living in a building with multiple levels. The other options do not make sense in this context.
Answer:
upstairs
Question: Where can you see people enjoying antique transportation?
Options: A) synagogue, B) montana, C) carnival, D) supermarket, E) car show,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are experiencing antique transportation as a form of entertainment.

Answer:
car show

Options: A) enemies, B) aggression, C) sweat, D) defeat, E) tiredness,

Answer:
sweat
Question: What happens when you play games?
Options: A) bored, B) have fun, C) win, D) challenge, E) bored,
Knowledge: Playing games is often associated with enjoyment and entertainment, which is typically described as "having fun." While some games can be challenging or competitive, the primary purpose of playing games is usually to engage in an enjoyable activity. The option "bored" is listed twice, making it an unlikely correct answer as it does not offer any new information. "Win" and "challenge" may also be possible outcomes of playing games, but they do not capture the essence of the experience in the same way "having fun" does.
Answer:
have fun
Question: When people aren't communicating or talking to each other, what happens?
Options: A) misunderstandings, B) headaches, C) introductions, D) conversation, E) distraction,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when people are not communicating or talking to each other, something negative happens. The word "misunderstandings" implies a lack of clear communication between individuals, which can lead to confusion and conflict. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the negative effects of a lack of communication.
Answer:
misunderstandings
Question: Beer is usually expensive when you attend what public event?
Options: A) refrigerator, B) drink, C) fridge, D) sporting event, E) bowling alley,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cost of beer is higher at a certain type of public event.

Answer:
sporting event
Question: When you see new people move in next door you might find it what?
Options: A) new friends, B) new experience, C) look around, D) change of surroundings, E) interesting,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that seeing new people move in next door will elicit a certain response. The word "interesting" implies that there is a level of curiosity or intrigue involved. The other options may be possible, but do not capture the sense of curiosity suggested by the sentence. "New friends" assumes a positive outcome that may not always occur, "new experience" is too vague and could refer to any number of things, "look around" is not a response but rather an action that may occur as a result, and "change of surroundings" may not necessarily be interesting.
Answer:
interesting
Question: Two adults do what before one gives birth to a child?
Options: A) loving couple, B) act of sex, C) birth, D) parents, E) consent,
Knowledge: Based on common knowledge and biology, it is known that two adults engage in sexual intercourse before the woman gives birth to a child. The other options do not accurately describe the process that leads to childbirth. "Loving couple" and "consent" may be necessary factors for healthy and consensual sexual intercourse, but they do not directly answer the question. "Birth" and "parents" refer to the end result and relationship status, respectively, rather than the action that precedes childbirth.
Answer:
act of sex
Question: If people are busy, what do they tend to do?
Options: A) make lists, B) trade places, C) talk to each other, D) hurry along, E) say "hello" to one another,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when people are busy, they tend to do something in response. "Hurry along" is the most logical choice as it implies a sense of urgency and rapid movement, which is a common response to being busy. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of being busy. Making lists may be a response to being organized, but not necessarily busy. Trading places and talking to each other do not necessarily indicate a response to busyness. Saying "hello" to one another may indicate social interaction, but not necessarily a response to busyness.
Answer:
hurry along
Question: When a person drinks, becoming inebriated, how are they likely to move?
Options: A) jumping, B) drunkenness, C) paralysis, D) staggering, E) fights,
Knowledge: The word "inebriated" is commonly used to describe the state of being drunk or intoxicated. People who are drunk often have difficulty maintaining their balance and walking in a straight line, leading to a staggering or swaying movement. Jumping and fighting are not necessarily associated with being drunk, and paralysis would make it impossible for the person to move at all.
Answer:
staggering
Question: Mary was a high school student student.She hang out in a quiet place where she could study.  Then the bell rang, telling her she needed to go.  Where  did she need to go?

Knowledge: The sentence states that Mary is a high school student, which indicates that she is most likely attending classes in a school. The sentence also suggests that Mary was studying, which further supports the idea that she was in a classroom or library, both of which are common places for students to study. The other options, such as university, dinner, or every aspect of life, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
classroom
Question: She had a busy schedule, she had to run errands and pick up the kids the second she did what?
Options: A) make time for, B) take money, C) go outdoors, D) leave work, E) field,
Knowledge: The sentence states that the woman had a busy schedule and needed to run errands and pick up her kids "the second she did" something. This implies that whatever she did would directly affect her ability to complete her tasks. Choosing "leave work" makes the most sense in this context, as leaving work would give her the time to run her errands and pick up her kids. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
leave work
Question: He waited far to long before beginning work. What is his immediate state of mind?
Options: A) stress, B) excitement, C) eagerness, D) panic, E) working,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person waited too long before starting work, which implies that they are now in a state of urgency, potentially experiencing stress or panic. Excitement and eagerness may be associated with starting work, but the phrase "waited too long" suggests a negative connotation, ruling those answers out. "Working" is a state of action, not a state of mind.
Answer:
panic
Question: The person wanted to make money, so what did he do?
Options: A) mint, B) selling things, C) cross street, D) feel resentful, E) machine part,

Knowledge: Bridges are typically built on strong foundations that can support the weight of the structure and withstand the forces of nature. Foundations made of rock are often preferred because they provide stability and durability. Pillars may also be built on rock foundations, but they are typically smaller structures than bridges. Mountains and mountain ranges are natural features that are not built by humans, and the surface of the earth is too broad to be considered a foundation for a specific structure.
Answer:
bridge
Question: He tried to jump his car, what terminal did he connect to after connecting the positive terminal?
Options: A) bad, B) uncertain, C) possimism, D) negative, E) adverse,
Knowledge: When jumping a car, the positive terminal of a live battery is connected to the positive terminal of the dead battery, and then the negative terminal of the live battery is connected to a metal ground point on the dead car (such as a bolt or a metal surface). Therefore, after connecting the positive terminal, the next step is to connect the negative terminal. The term "negative" is also commonly used to refer to the negative terminal of a battery, making it a logical choice for the answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
negative
Question: The drama had quite an affect on the humans, the highs and lows had them all what?
Options: A) give up, B) bald, C) very adaptable, D) male or female, E) emotional,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the drama had a strong emotional impact on the humans who experienced it, which can be inferred from the phrase "highs and lows." This indicates that the humans were experiencing a range of emotions, which would make them emotional. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
emotional
Question: A squirrel ran up to it's home, where is the small dog likely to be barking up?
Options: A) manhattan apartment, B) wood, C) neighbor's yard, D) tree, E) basket,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a squirrel ran up to its home, which is most likely a tree. Therefore, it is likely that the small dog would be barking up a tree as it may have spotted the squirrel and is trying to catch its attention. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
tree
Question: The housewife needed dry storage, where should she put her things?
Options: A) storage closet, B) building, C) inside, D) warehouse, E) pantry,
Knowledge: The word "dry" suggests that the items to be stored may be affected by moisture or humidity. A pantry is typically a cool, dry place designed for storing food items such as canned goods, cereal, and non-perishables. A storage closet may also be dry, but it's not typically associated with food storage. A building or warehouse may not have the right conditions for dry storage, and "inside" is too general and does not provide enough context.
Answer:
pantry
Question: Where might I find a bowl nestled among other bowls in the kitchen?
Options: A) refrigerator, B) kitchen top, C) cupboard, D) dishwasher, E) apartment,
Knowledge: A cupboard is a type of storage unit often found in kitchens that typically contains plates, bowls, and other kitchenware. The fact that the bowl is "nestled among other bowls" suggests that it would be found in a storage area with other similar items, such as in a cupboard. The other options do not typically contain or store bowls in the kitchen.
Answer:
cupboard
Question: When people have a variety of opinions, what can they do with one another?
Options: A) divorce, B) believe in god, C) gain weight, D) agree or disagree, E) become angry,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people have differing opinions, which implies that they are in a position to agree or disagree with one another. Divorce, belief in God, and gaining weight do not have any logical connection to this context. Becoming angry is a possible emotional response, but it is not a direct action that people can take with one another.
Answer:
agree or disagree
Question: The government cracked down on anybody protesting, what did the government dislike?
Options: A) buy cats at petstore, B) question authority, C) crowds, D) forget, E) wash dishes,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the government was targeting people who were protesting, which typically involves speaking out against authority or challenging the status quo. This indicates that the government likely disliked people who questioned authority, making "question authority" the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
question authority
Question: Bill told the audience that good things would happen to them if they gave him all of their money. Where is Bill most likely speaking?
Options: A) stadium, B) hockey game, C) baseball game, D) church, E) movie theater,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Bill is most likely speaking in a religious setting, such as a church. The idea of giving money to someone in exchange for good things happening is often associated with religious practices, such as tithing. The other options, such as a stadium, hockey game, baseball game, or movie theater, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
church
Question: Joe wants to stop being married to Jane.  Jane doesn't want it, but she sadly accepts what?
Options: A) pleasure, B) getting divorce, C) heartache, D) heartbreak, E) beatings,
Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that Joe wants to end his marriage to Jane, which suggests that they are discussing a divorce. The option "getting divorce" directly addresses this point and is therefore the correct answer. The other options, such as "pleasure" and "beatings," do not make sense in the context of this sentence and can be eliminated as incorrect answers. "Heartache" and "heartbreak" could potentially make sense, but they do not directly address the specific action that Jane is accepting (i.e. a divorce).
Answer:
getting divorce
Question: When trying to clean clothes, what is something that you need?
Options: A) get dirty, B) launder, C) sort, D) bleach, E) use water,
Knowledge: Water is an essential element when it comes to cleaning clothes. It is used to rinse out stains and dirt from fabric, especially when combined with detergent. While sorting may be helpful in organization, it is not a necessary step in cleaning clothes. Bleach is a type of cleaning agent that may be used in some cases, but not in all, and getting dirty is the opposite of cleaning. Laundering is the process of cleaning clothes, so it is not a necessary item you need in addition to water.
Answer:
use water
Question: The screwdriver was surprisingly sharp.  This is because it's tip  was what?
Options: A) blunt, B) inaccurate, C) flat, D) above board, E) dim,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the screwdriver was unexpectedly sharp, which may indicate that it was not designed to be sharp. The word "sharp" in this context typically refers to a point or edge that can pierce or cut through objects. In contrast, the word "flat" means lacking in sharpness, which could explain why the screwdriver's surprisingly sharp tip was unexpected. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
flat
Question: Where could I eat a chocolate cake?
Options: A) mouth, B) restaurant, C) supermarket, D) school, E) box,
Knowledge: The word "eat" implies that the chocolate cake is a food item meant for consumption. While it may be possible to eat a chocolate cake at home from a box, the other options (mouth, school, and supermarket) are not feasible locations to eat a chocolate cake. A restaurant is a likely choice because it is a place where food is served and eaten. Therefore, the correct answer is "restaurant."
Answer:
restaurant
Question: What might the result of unwanted flirting be?
Options: A) attraction, B) problems, C) the gallows, D) being slapped, E) curiosity,
Knowledge: The phrase "unwanted flirting" suggests that the flirting is not welcome or appreciated by the recipient. In this context, the result of such behavior would likely be negative, such as causing problems or leading to a physical altercation like being slapped. The other options do not fit with the negative connotations of the phrase "unwanted flirting."
Answer:
being slapped
Question: When they got a divorce, they stopped talking to each other, so what did they have?
Options: A) richer, B) depression, C) meloncoly, D) bad feelings, E) emotional distress,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the divorce between the two individuals resulted in negative emotions or a strained relationship, as evidenced by their lack of communication. While some of the other options may be a result of a divorce, the context of the sentence suggests that the answer is related to the emotional effects of their separation.
Answer:
bad feelings
Question: Where would you put a drink if you do not plan to use it soon?
Options: A) cabinet, B) camelback, C) cup, D) backpack, E) can,
Knowledge: A cabinet is a piece of furniture used for storage, typically in a kitchen or dining area. It would be a logical place to put a drink if you do not plan to use it soon, as it could be kept out of the way and protected from spills or other accidents. The other options do not make as much sense in this context. A camelback is a type of hydration pack worn on the back, a cup and can are both used to drink from, and a backpack is for carrying items, not storing drinks.
Answer:
cabinet
Question: James didn't understand what was going on, but he knew that he had to choose.   He decided that he wasn't going to accept temptation, and did what to it?
Options: A) predetermination, B) undecided, C) force, D) concluded, E) reject,
Knowledge: The sentence states that James decided not to accept temptation, which implies that he actively chose to resist it. The word "reject" is the only option that accurately reflects this action, while the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Predetermination" refers to something being decided beforehand, "undecided" means not having made a choice yet, "force" implies using physical or emotional pressure, and "concluded" means coming to a decision after consideration.
Answer:
reject
Question: A monkey is out in the wild, where are they likely to be?
Options: A) tropical areas, B) school, C) research laboratory, D) pet store, E) story book,
Knowledge: Monkeys are typically found in tropical areas, such as rainforests, where they live in the trees and forage for food. They are not typically found in school, research laboratories, or pet stores, as they are wild animals and not domesticated. While monkeys may appear in storybooks, this is not a reliable indicator of their real-life habitats.
Answer:
tropical areas
Question: If a mechanic attaches a chain to your bumper what is he likely driving?
Options: A) obesity, B) bicycle, C) motorbike, D) jewelry store, E) tow truck,
Knowledge: Attaching a chain to a car bumper is a common practice for tow trucks, which are used to transport vehicles that are unable to move on their own. The other options, such as obesity, bicycle, motorbike, and jewelry store, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
tow truck
Question: Why might someone avoid getting a new car?
Options: A) move quickly, B) go fast, C) cost money, D) crash, E) slow down,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason why someone might avoid getting a new car. One of the most common reasons for avoiding a new car is the expense. New cars are often more expensive than used cars and require more ongoing financial investment in terms of maintenance, repair costs, and insurance premiums. The other answer choices have no clear connection to the context of the question.
Answer:
cost money
Question: You should probably have something healthier than just eat ice cream if you what?
Options: A) were hungry, B) depressed, C) cool down, D) exercise, E) let melt in mouth,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that eating only ice cream is not a healthy choice when one is hungry. This implies that there are healthier food options available when one is hungry. The other options like being depressed, cooling down or letting the ice cream melt in the mouth do not have any clear relation to the context of the sentence. The option of exercising may be a healthy choice but it is not suggested as an alternative in the sentence.
Answer:
were hungry
Question: What will an unprepared person experience when taking final exams?
Options: A) graduation, B) anxiety, C) happy, D) graduating, E) headaches,
Knowledge: The use of the word "unprepared" suggests that the person taking the final exams is not ready for the test. This could lead to feelings of stress, nervousness, and anxiety. Graduation and graduating are not relevant because they suggest a task that has already been completed (not something that is about to be undertaken). Happy is not relevant because the sentence is discussing a negative emotion, and headaches may be a side effect of stress but are not the main focus of this sentence.
Answer:
anxiety
Question: The champagne was good, it was both sweet and what?
Options: A) bitter, B) decaying, C) spicy, D) sour, E) dry,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the champagne had a sweet taste as well as another quality that is complementary to sweetness. The opposite of sweet is often considered to be sour, bitter, or spicy, which do not fit with the context of the sentence. Decaying is not a taste, and therefore cannot be the correct answer. Dryness is often used to describe the taste of champagne and is a common characteristic of high-quality sparkling wines. Therefore, dry is the correct answer.
Answer:
dry
Question: When picking up drinks, what kind requires you to hold them by the neck?
Options: A) glass, B) shoulder, C) body, D) guillotine, E) bottle,
Knowledge: Bottles typically have a narrower neck and wider body, making it necessary to hold them by the neck to ensure a firm grip. Holding a glass by the neck doesn't make much sense, as glasses are typically wider at the base, and holding them by the neck would result in an unstable grip. "Shoulder" and "body" are not descriptors of a type of drink, and "guillotine" is not related to drinks at all, so the correct answer is "bottle".
Answer:
bottle
Question: Where would be a good place for a weasel to hide?
Options: A) children's story, B) animated film, C) henhouse, D) mulberry bush, E) bank,
Knowledge: The mulberry bush is a common place referenced in the classic nursery rhyme "Pop Goes the Weasel," suggesting that it would be a good place for a weasel to hide. The other options do not have any clear connections to weasels or their behavior.
Answer:
mulberry bush
Question: What does every person have that not every wolf has?
Options: A) human intelligence, B) hide, C) name, D) mouth, E) heart,
Knowledge: The question is asking for something that every person has that not every wolf has. The answer is likely to be a trait or characteristic that distinguishes humans from wolves. Out of the choices given, only "name" fits this criteria as wolves do not typically have names, while humans are commonly given names. The other choices, such as "human intelligence," "hide," "mouth," and "heart" may be traits that both humans and wolves have in common.
Answer:
name
Question: He needed a computer program to do a certain task and he knew how to make it, so he began to do what?
Options: A) get frustrated, B) write code, C) debug, D) damage, E) compile,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needed a computer program to complete a task, and he had the knowledge of how to make it. Therefore, he would logically start to write code in order to create the program. Debugging comes after writing code and refers to the process of finding and fixing errors in the code. Getting frustrated or damaging the computer are unlikely actions one would take in this situation. Compiling is the process of turning code into a program, but it is done after writing and debugging the code.
Answer:
write code
Question: When people meet other people in a convivial setting, what tends to happen?
Options: A) expect miracles, B) think of life, C) talk to each other, D) form friendships, E) arguments,
Knowledge: The word "convivial" suggests a friendly and sociable atmosphere, which is conducive to forming new connections and relationships. When people are in a convivial setting, they tend to be open and receptive to meeting new people, which can lead to the formation of friendships. The other choices (expect miracles, think of life, talk to each other, arguments) do not necessarily pertain to the context of the sentence, and do not align with the expectation of a convivial setting.
Answer:
form friendships
Question: Bob pulled a rock out of the ground.  He wanted to examine the thing because he was into geology.   He was also into waterskiing.   He had many what?
Options: A) talents, B) complex, C) interesting, D) learn more about, E) interests,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob has a variety of hobbies or activities that he enjoys, as evidenced by his interest in both geology and waterskiing. The word "interests" is the most appropriate choice to describe this, as it refers to the things that someone enjoys doing in their free time. The other options do not accurately convey the meaning of the sentence.
Answer:
interests
Question: The referee wasn't specialized in one thing. He refereed many games.  He was offered a job but wasn't sure what it would be.  What did he know it would be?
Options: A) side with opponent, B) football, C) hockey game, D) part two boxers, E) sporting event,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the referee is skilled in refereeing various games and has been offered a job that he is unsure of. The fact that the job offer doesn't specify a particular game suggests that it could be a position in a general sporting event. The options related to specific games such as football, hockey or boxing are not supported by the given information. The choice "side with opponent" is contradictory to a referee's role and doesn't make sense in the context.
Answer:
sporting event
Question: What do eating hamburgers in excess lead to short term?
Options: A) gain weight, B) health problems, C) death, D) nausea, E) tomato,
Knowledge: The question asks about short term effects of eating hamburgers in excess, which suggests that the answer should be a relatively immediate consequence. While gaining weight and health problems can be long term consequences of consuming too many hamburgers, nausea is a common side effect of overeating or eating greasy or heavy foods. Death and tomato are not logical options for this question.
Answer:
nausea
Question: If friends comment on the condition of your living space what should you do?
Options: A) socialize, B) go somewhere, C) go to the store, D) clean room, E) going out at night,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the friends have commented on the condition of the person's living space, indicating that it may be messy or cluttered. In this situation, it would be appropriate to clean the room in order to address the issue that has been pointed out by the friends. The other options do not provide a solution to the problem.
Answer:
clean room
Question: Where might a small ball be bounced from?
Options: A) soccer game, B) street, C) toy store, D) child's hand, E) on the sidewalk,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a small ball is being bounced by someone or something, and one of the options refers to a "child's hand," which is a common place for a child to hold and bounce a small ball. The other options do not seem to have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a soccer game involves a larger ball, the street and sidewalk may refer to bouncing a ball, but not specifically a small one, and a toy store is not a likely place for a ball to be bounced.
Answer:
child's hand
Question: Where would you use a computer while gaining knowledge?
Options: A) apartment, B) house, C) table, D) house, E) school,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location where one gains knowledge is relevant to the answer. The options "apartment", "house", and "table" do not indicate a specific context for learning. However, "school" is a common location where people use computers to gain knowledge through research, studying, and online classes. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "school".
Answer:
school
Question: Where do young boys hide dirty magazines?
Options: A) library, B) drawer, C) dentist, D) bed, E) airport,
Knowledge: The question is asking about a common hiding place for young boys to keep dirty magazines, which implies that the material is likely inappropriate or taboo. The bed is a common hiding place for personal items, such as magazines, because it provides privacy and can be easily accessed. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question.
Answer:
bed
Question: Where would someone bring you a cup?
Options: A) apartment, B) closet, C) restaurant, D) table, E) party,
Knowledge: A cup is a common item that is typically used to serve a beverage, such as coffee or tea. Restaurants are places where people often gather to have a meal and drinks, so it is likely that someone would bring you a cup at a restaurant. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
restaurant
Question: Where do you hang notes in the kitchen?
Options: A) fridge, B) sheet music, C) medical chart, D) from a hook, E) desk,
Knowledge: The question asks specifically about hanging notes in the kitchen, which suggests that the notes are likely related to grocery lists, reminders, or messages for family members. The fridge is a common location for hanging such notes as it is a central and easily accessible spot in the kitchen. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question.
Answer:
fridge
Question: A flea made the dog itch, this is because to feed it can do what?
Options: A) suck blood, B) bite, C) jump, D) lay eggs, E) attack,
Knowledge: Fleas are known for feeding on the blood of their hosts, which is likely the cause of the dog itching. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior of fleas. Biting and attacking may be related to flea behavior in some way, but sucking blood is the most accurate answer based on the information given in the sentence. Jumping and laying eggs are also behaviors associated with fleas, but they are not directly related to why the dog is itching.
Answer:
suck blood
Question: The buildings were designed to hold a lot of people, where should it be built?
Options: A) small, B) in a hole, C) large city, D) university, E) town,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the buildings were designed to accommodate a large number of people, which is characteristic of urban areas where population density is high. Large cities are typically designed to have a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial areas, in order to support the needs of a large population. University and town are not likely to have the same level of infrastructure or population as a city, while in a hole and small are not feasible options for the construction of such buildings.
Answer:
large city
Question: What do you need the most to be living life?
Options: A) breathe, B) learning, C) sorrow, D) wear a mullet, E) marriage,
Knowledge: Breathing is a necessary function for all living beings, and it is essential for sustaining life. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Learning and marriage may enhance one's life, but they are not essential for survival. Sorrow is a negative emotion and cannot be considered a requirement for living life. Wear a mullet is a nonsensical option and has no relevance to the question.
Answer:
breathe
Question: There were all sorts of shapes in the textbook, the geometry teacher explained how to find the area of the surface for each what?
Options: A) turtle, B) tetrahedron, C) object, D) lake, E) geometry problem,
Knowledge: The use of the word "shapes" in the sentence suggests that the geometry teacher is discussing various geometric figures. The term "object" is the most general of the choices and could encompass any kind of three-dimensional shape. The other choices are more specific and may not be relevant to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
object
Question: What happens if you eat hamburger that's very big?
Options: A) hungry, B) choking, C) get full, D) lose weight, E) getting fat,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you eat a very big hamburger, you will experience a certain outcome. One likely outcome is that you will feel full, since the hamburger is likely to fill up your stomach.

Answer:
get full
Question: I know the answer, but I do not do what to it?
Options: A) ignorant, B) correct, C) ignorance, D) had learnt, E) understand,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker knows the answer to a question or problem, but they do not know what to do with it. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect this feeling of uncertainty or confusion. Among the given choices, "understand" is the most appropriate answer because it implies that the speaker has grasped the meaning or solution to the problem, but needs more information or guidance on how to act on it. The other options are either irrelevant or inconsistent with the context of the sentence.
Answer:
understand

Options: A) car crash, B) splinter, C) automobile accidents, D) smoke, E) backache,
Knowledge: The question asks what physical condition a driver could have that would make them not want to drive their car. A backache is a common physical ailment that can make it uncomfortable or painful to sit for prolonged periods of time, such as when driving a car. The other options, such as car crashes, splinters, automobile accidents, and smoke, are not related to a physical condition that would specifically affect a driver's ability or desire to drive.
Answer:
backache
Question: If you see a policeman in the street waving flashlights what are they there to do?
Options: A) jump, B) arrest criminals, C) book robber, D) direct traffic, E) wave on,
Knowledge: The use of a flashlight by a policeman in the street typically indicates that they are trying to direct traffic. This is often done during busy periods, accidents or when there is a breakdown in the usual traffic flow. The other options such as jumping, arresting criminals, or booking robbers do not make sense in this context.
Answer:
direct traffic
Question: He wasn't able to enjoy the party because he was too worried about his things and cleaning up, where was the party?
Options: A) home, B) fraternity house, C) boat, D) friend's house, E) blowing off steam,

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
home
Question: where do you buy the freshest apples?
Options: A) shop, B) fridge, C) farmers market, D) a tree, E) grocery store,
Knowledge: A farmers market is a location where farmers and other vendors sell fresh produce directly to consumers. It is likely that the freshest apples would be found at a farmers market because they are sold directly from the farm to the consumer without any storage or transportation in between. The other options, such as a grocery store or fridge, may not have as fresh of produce as they may have been stored or transported for longer periods of time.
Answer:
farmers market
Question: What is often an outward expression of happiness?
Options: A) love, B) laughter, C) spread, D) tears, E) limp,
Knowledge: The word "outward" suggests that the answer is related to something that can be seen or heard. "Happiness" is also a clue that the answer is related to a positive emotion. Laughter is a common expression of joy and happiness, and is often easily recognizable and audible. "Love" and "tears" could also be outward expressions of happiness, but they are not as commonly associated with happiness as laughter. "Spread" and "limp" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
laughter
Question: What can a manufacturer experience when people are constantly buying products?
Options: A) economic boom, B) loss of money, C) agony, D) being able to use, E) spending money,
Knowledge: When people are constantly buying products, it means that there is a high demand for the manufacturer's goods, which can lead to an economic boom. This is because the company is making more sales and generating more revenue, which can result in increased profits and growth for the business. The other options do not accurately reflect the positive impact that a high demand can have on a manufacturing company.
Answer:
economic boom
Question: A big fountain was the center piece of the renovation, it had all been paid for by a grant to the what?
Options: A) city, B) state, C) front of casino, D) rome, E) public place,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a grant was used to fund the renovation, but it does not mention any specific organization or entity. However, the fact that a fountain was the centerpiece of the renovation and it was located in a public place implies that it was likely funded by a local government or municipality, such as a city government. The other options, such as a state, a casino, or Rome, are less likely to be the correct answer as they do not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
city
Question: Why would someone be likely to avoid kissing?
Options: A) arousal, B) shortness of breath, C) herpes, D) strong feelings, E) confusion,
Knowledge: Herpes is a sexually transmitted infection that can be spread through kissing, which is why someone may avoid it if they are worried about getting infected or if they have an active outbreak of herpes. Arousal and strong feelings may actually make someone more likely to want to kiss, while confusion is not likely to be a factor in this context. Shortness of breath could potentially be a reason someone avoids kissing, but it is not as directly related to the spread of herpes as the infection itself.
Answer:
herpes
Question: What can judging something wrong lead to?
Options: A) eat cake, B) responsibility, C) resentment, D) controversy, E) go to jail,
Knowledge: The question asks about the potential consequences of judging something wrong, and controversy is a logical answer as it suggests that disagreements and debates may arise from differing opinions on what is right or wrong. Eating cake and going to jail are not relevant responses to the question, and while responsibility and resentment may be potential consequences of judging something wrong, they do not capture the full range of possible outcomes as effectively as controversy.
Answer:
controversy
Question: Why do people want to read fiction books?
Options: A) having fun, B) falling asleep, C) learn new things, D) learn unknown concepts, E) memorize,
Knowledge: While people may want to read fiction books for a variety of reasons, such as to learn new things or concepts, the most commonly cited reason is to have fun. Fiction books often provide an escape from reality and allow readers to immerse themselves in imaginative worlds and characters, providing entertainment and enjoyment. While some people may read to fall asleep or to memorize information, these are not typically the primary reasons why people choose to read fiction.
Answer:
having fun
Question: What would you do to numbers that are positive integers to get a result that is orders of magnitude larger?
Options: A) written down, B) divided, C) added up, D) multiplied, E) get headache,
Knowledge: When you multiply a positive integer by another positive integer, the resulting number will be orders of magnitude larger than the original number. This is because each additional digit increases the magnitude of the number by a factor of 10. The other options do not involve any mathematical operations that would increase the magnitude of a number, and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer.
Answer:
multiplied
Question: She couldn't hide she liked the boy she was talking to, she had a constant what?
Options: A) make eye contact, B) smile, C) another person, D) listening, E) compliment,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the girl's feelings towards the boy were evident in her behavior. One common way that people physically show interest or attraction towards someone is by smiling, which is likely why the sentence states that she had a constant smile. The other options (make eye contact, listening, compliment, another person) do not necessarily indicate interest or attraction towards the boy, and therefore are not the correct answer.
Answer:
smile
Question: The cut was deep, the doctor had to use stitches in doing what the sides?
Options: A) joining, B) put together, C) paste, D) heal, E) paste,
Knowledge: The word "stitches" suggests that the doctor was sewing something together, which would be the sides of the cut in this case. "Joining" and "putting together" both have a similar meaning to sewing or stitching. "Paste" could refer to a topical treatment, but it does not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Heal" is the ultimate result of the doctor's actions, but it does not describe what the doctor actually did.
Answer:
joining
Question: Every person would get along in a what?
Options: A) eat well, B) live comfortably, C) perfect world, D) fruit bowl, E) own house,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in a perfect world, every person would get along.

The other options are not related to the concept of a perfect world or getting along with others.
Answer:
perfect world
Question: What is a common cause of injury?
Options: A) accident, B) theatre, C) doctor's office, D) hockey game, E) living thing,
Knowledge: The word "injury" suggests that the question is asking about a harm that comes to a person's body. The word "common" implies that the cause is something that occurs frequently. Accidents are a common cause of injury because they can happen in many different situations, such as car crashes, falls, and sports injuries. The other options do not have the same association with injuries.
Answer:
accident
Question: If you keep telling many people about being a vegetarian what do you risk becoming?
Options: A) annoyance, B) accomplish, C) intoxicated, D) emotional distress, E) notoriety,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if someone keeps talking to multiple people about their vegetarianism, there might be negative consequences. "Annoyance" is the most fitting choice since the continuous talking about vegetarianism can become tedious and irritating to others. The other options do not seem to relate to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
annoyance
Question: James imported ugly cabinets because they were cheap.  They wouldn't be seen so it didn't matter what they looked like.  Where might they be installed?
Options: A) kitchen, B) planes, C) mexico, D) bathroom, E) pantry,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cabinets were imported because they were cheap, and that they wouldn't be seen, which implies that they were meant for a storage space rather than a visible area like a kitchen or bathroom. A pantry is a place where people store food and other household items, and it is not a high-traffic area of the house, so it makes sense that someone might choose to install cheaper and less attractive cabinets there. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, either because they are visible areas (kitchen and bathroom) or because they do not make sense in the context (planes and Mexico).
Answer:
pantry
Question: The comedian made a dull joke about a bald eagle and it ending up that way because of what treatment?
Options: A) new york, B) canada, C) chemotherapy, D) rocky mountains, E) british columbia,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the joke made by the comedian was related to bald eagles and a specific treatment that may have caused them to become bald. Chemotherapy is a medical treatment commonly associated with hair loss, which may explain why it was mentioned in the same sentence as the joke about bald eagles. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
chemotherapy
Question: Where would you put your car keys if you want to go driving?
Options: A) ignition switch, B) pocket, C) purse, D) home, E) trunk,
Knowledge: The ignition switch is where the car key is inserted to start the engine and begin driving. The other options, such as pocket, purse, and home, are not relevant to the context of the question and would not be where one would typically place car keys when preparing to drive. The trunk is also an incorrect option as keys are not typically stored in the trunk of a car for driving purposes.
Answer:
ignition switch
Question: It is a lovely day, let's go outside and skate instead of doing what?
Options: A) really, B) put on helmet, C) sing, D) not work so hard, E) falling down,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that going outside to skate is a better alternative to doing something else. The other answer choices, such as putting on a helmet or singing, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Falling down" is also not a logical alternative to doing something else, but a potential consequence of skating. Therefore, the correct answer must be "not work so hard," as it is the only opposing option that suggests a different activity that is more enjoyable than working.
Answer:
not work so hard
Question: He worked hard to have great success at his chosen what?
Options: A) new job, B) vocation, C) awards ceremony, D) schedule, E) michigan,
Knowledge: The use of the phrase "chosen what" indicates that the correct answer will be a career or profession that someone actively pursues or chooses for themselves. The use of the word "success" suggests that this career or profession may involve achieving certain goals, milestones, or accomplishments. Out of the given choices, only "vocation" fits this criteria, as it refers to a person's life/career calling or purpose. The other choices are either too specific (new job, awards ceremony) or unrelated (schedule, Michigan) to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
vocation
Question: The cover was a hindrance to the diners, so what did they do with it?
Options: A) underneath, B) opening, C) divert suspicion, D) leave open, E) landcover,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the cover was causing some sort of problem or inconvenience for the diners, so they decided to do something about it. The most logical option would be to leave it open or remove it entirely. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "underneath" and "opening" are not actions that can be taken with a cover, "divert suspicion" is irrelevant and doesn't make sense, and "landcover" is not a common term associated with covers in this context.
Answer:
leave open
Question: In any city you usually see a high rise where?
Options: A) residential area, B) san francisco, C) downtown, D) suburbs, E) detroit,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the high rise is located in a central and busy part of a city. The option "downtown" is the most likely answer, as it refers to the commercial and business hub of a city where high-rise buildings are commonly found. The other options are either too specific (e.g., San Francisco, Detroit) or not relevant to the context of a high-rise building.
Answer:
downtown
Question: If a lot of cargo trucks come and go every day, where would the forklift get the most use?
Options: A) loading dock, B) construction site, C) construction yard, D) warehouse, E) cargo,
Knowledge: The context suggests that the forklift would be used in a place where cargo trucks come and go frequently, which is usually at the loading dock of a warehouse or a distribution center. A loading dock is a designated area where goods are loaded and unloaded from trucks, so it is where the forklift would be most useful. The other options such as construction sites or yards may also use forklifts, but they are not as likely to have a high volume of cargo trucks coming and going.
Answer:
loading dock
Question: The route passenger was flipping through a magazine, he was bored waiting for his ride where?
Options: A) shop, B) work, C) rack, D) bus depot, E) newsstand,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the passenger is waiting for a ride, which points to the bus depot as the correct answer. A bus depot is a place where buses stop to let passengers on and off, and it is common for people to wait there for their transportation. The other options (shop, work, rack, and newsstand) do not typically involve waiting for a ride, and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
bus depot
Question: What is often the result of having lunch too fast?
Options: A) spending money, B) sickness, C) heartburn, D) low blood sugar, E) obesity,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence associated with eating lunch too quickly. Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can be caused by eating too quickly and not chewing food properly. Sickness, low blood sugar, and obesity are not necessarily associated with eating too quickly, and spending money would not be a direct consequence of eating too quickly.
Answer:
heartburn
Question: If the weather means you what, so do your animals?
Options: A) travel, B) get cold, C) feel pain, D) move, E) electrical circuit,
Knowledge: The phrase "If the weather means you..." implies that the weather has a certain effect on the subject being discussed, and the answer choice "get cold" makes logical sense in this context. Animals are often affected by changes in temperature, and if the weather is cold, it makes sense that the animals would also get cold. The other options are not necessarily related to weather or animals.
Answer:
get cold
Question: WHere does someone sit in a chair to gossip?
Options: A) desk, B) friend's house, C) auditorium, D) synagogue, E) ocean,
Knowledge: The word "gossip" implies a casual and social setting where people are talking about personal matters. Sitting at a desk or in an auditorium does not fit this context. A synagogue is a religious place and not necessarily a place for gossip. The ocean is unrelated to the context of the question. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a friend's house, which is a common place for casual conversations and gossip.
Answer:
friend's house
Question: She filled the thing with water and went to plug it in, she had finally finished her garden with what centerpiece?
Options: A) stream, B) perfume, C) sink, D) fountain, E) swamp,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker filled something with water and plugged it in, which indicates that it is an electronic device. The use of the word "centerpiece" suggests that it is a decorative object that holds a prominent place in the garden. A fountain fits these criteria as it is a water feature that is often used as a decorative centerpiece in gardens. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not commonly associated with gardens or decorative centerpieces.
Answer:
fountain
Question: Where would you find a single air conditioner?
Options: A) house, B) in a bike, C) car, D) hard, E) texas,
Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer must be a location or object where a single air conditioner could be found. Therefore, options such as "house", "hard", and "Texas" are not specific enough to provide a clear answer. Additionally, the option "in a bike" is unlikely since bicycles generally do not have air conditioning units. Therefore, the best option is a car, as it is a common location for a single air conditioner unit in order to keep the passengers cool while driving.
Answer:
car
Question: If you're hearing sounds what product the uses a laser are you using?
Options: A) physics lab, B) laboratory, C) bomb, D) hospital, E) cd players,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the product mentioned uses a laser to produce sound. CD players use lasers to read the data stored on a disc and convert it into audio. Physics labs may use lasers for experiments, but this is not specific to sound production. Laboratories, bombs, and hospitals do not typically use lasers for sound production.
Answer:
cd players
Question: The music was very dear to him, he had done what with it during an important time in his life?
Options: A) night club, B) dreamt, C) composed, D) written on paper, E) stolen,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the music was very dear to the person, which suggests that they were involved in its creation. The phrase "during an important time in his life" implies that the person had a significant personal connection to the music, which further supports the idea that they were the composer. The options of night club and stolen do not fit with the context of the sentence and dreamt and written on paper do not provide enough information to support a correct answer.
Answer:
composed
Question: Dancing or walking too much will lead to what on your feet?
Options: A) humiliation, B) fatigue, C) skin, D) blisters, E) exhaustion,
Knowledge: The question suggests that the activity of dancing or walking can cause a physical problem on the feet. Fatigue and exhaustion are related to muscle tiredness and overall exhaustion, while humiliation is related to social embarrassment rather than a physical symptom. Skin is too broad of a term, and not specific enough to indicate a foot problem. Blisters, however, are a common problem that can occur on the feet from too much friction or pressure, making them the most likely correct answer.
Answer:
blisters
Question: If you know how to read and write you are what?
Options: A) smart, B) literate, C) have paper, D) not give up, E) creativity,
Knowledge: Literacy refers to the ability to read and write, which is the context of the sentence. While being literate may be associated with intelligence or having access to education (which could be connected with being smart or having paper), the most direct connection to the sentence is that literacy is the ability to read and write. The other options may not be incorrect, but they are not the most precise match for the question.
Answer:
literate
Question: What would you experience if a friend robs you after cashing in chips at a casino?
Options: A) betrayal, B) resentment, C) depressed, D) leave, E) profit,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a friend has taken advantage of you by stealing after cashing in chips at a casino. This would likely lead to feelings of betrayal, as you had trusted your friend but they violated that trust. Resentment and depression are also possible emotional responses, but betrayal is the most likely fit based on the context. "Leave" and "profit" are not relevant options, as they do not reflect the negative impact of being robbed by a friend.
Answer:
betrayal
Question: People took their seats and read their programs. They were expecting to enjoy an entertaining night of what?
Options: A) group functions, B) church, C) theater, D) conference, E) television,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people took their seats and read their programs, which is commonly associated with a theater performance. It also mentions that they were expecting to enjoy an entertaining night, which is another clue that points to theater as the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
theater
Question: You shouldn't consume toothpaste, despite that it goes in your what??
Options: A) bathroom, B) sink, C) traveling case, D) suitcase, E) mouth,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while toothpaste is commonly found in the bathroom and may be stored in a traveling case or suitcase, it is not meant to be consumed. The context of the sentence implies that the word being sought refers to a part of the body, and the only option that fits that description is "mouth."
Answer:
mouth
Question: The weasel would go round and round the what while waiting to attack?
Options: A) apple tree, B) rabbit warren, C) chicken coop, D) mulberry bush, E) viking ship,
Knowledge: The phrase "go round and round" suggests that the weasel is moving in circles around something. In this case, the weasel is waiting to attack, so it is likely circling its prey. Out of the options given, only the mulberry bush is commonly associated with the children's rhyme "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush," which includes the phrase "the monkey chased the weasel." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
mulberry bush
Question: What do airplanes do as they are beginning to take off?
Options: A) speed up, B) carry people, C) stop, D) slow down, E) crash,
Knowledge: Airplanes need to gain speed in order to take off, which is why they typically accelerate down the runway during this phase of flight. The other options are not accurate descriptions of what airplanes do during takeoff.
Answer:
speed up
Question: Billy was a solider.  He joined the military because he wanted to do what?
Options: A) to marry, B) fight for freedom, C) report for duty, D) wait for orders, E) receive orders,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Billy joined the military for a specific reason. The phrase "fight for freedom" is commonly associated with military service, as soldiers often go to war to protect their country's freedoms and liberties. The other options do not make sense in this context. For example, getting married is not typically a reason to join the military, and waiting for orders is something that soldiers do after they have already joined.
Answer:
fight for freedom
Question: What might cause someone to have a last passing sentence?
Options: A) bounding, B) death, C) grief, D) judgement, E) appeals,
Knowledge: The phrase "last passing sentence" suggests an end to someone's life. The word "passing" is often used as a euphemism for death, while "last" implies that this sentence is final, indicating that the person has died. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to death or the end of life. "Bounding" could refer to jumping or moving quickly, while "grief" is a feeling of intense sadness, "judgment" refers to decision-making or legal processes, and "appeals" are requests for a decision to be reviewed.
Answer:
death
Question: The mountain was very massive.  It did what to the nearby hills?
Options: A) lame, B) insubstantial, C) inconsequential, D) dwarf, E) massless,
Knowledge: The word "massive" implies that the mountain is very large and imposing in size, which suggests that it would make the nearby hills seem small by comparison. The word "dwarf" means to make seem small or insignificant, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options are all antonyms of massive and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
dwarf
Question: Where can you find a single musician that an audience is listening to?
Options: A) studio, B) stage, C) band, D) symphony, E) orchestra,
Knowledge: The word "audience" suggests that the musician is performing in front of a group of people, and the phrase "single musician" suggests that they are performing alone rather than as part of a larger group. The most likely place for this to happen is on a stage, where a performer can stand alone and be the focus of attention for the audience. The other options, such as a studio or orchestra, may involve multiple musicians working together or may not involve a live audience.
Answer:
stage
Question: What do you miss out on if you stay in and read book all day?
Options: A) learning, B) education, C) experience, D) knowledge, E) learn to read,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if someone stays in and reads a book all day, they are missing out on something. Since reading a book is a solitary activity, it's likely that the thing they are missing out on is some sort of social or interactive experience. The other options such as learning, education, knowledge, or learning to read are not necessarily mutually exclusive with reading books and therefore don't explain what someone would miss out on if they specifically stay in and read all day.
Answer:
experience
Question: Where might someone find an abundance of cloth?
Options: A) egyptian tombs, B) fabric store, C) kitchen, D) washing machine, E) bedroom,
Knowledge: A fabric store is a place that commonly sells cloth. This is in contrast to the other options, which do not typically have cloth readily available. Egyptian tombs may have preserved clothing made of cloth, but it would not be readily available for purchase or use. The kitchen and bedroom may have items made of cloth, but they are not places where cloth is typically stored or sold. The washing machine is used to clean clothes made of cloth, but it is not a place where cloth is found in abundance.
Answer:
fabric store
Question: The man finished mowing his lawn and enjoyed a glass of lemonade on his porch, he took a sip and told himself that life was what?
Options: A) good, B) ending soon, C) fleeting, D) finite, E) important,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man had finished a chore (mowing his lawn) and was therefore taking a break to enjoy a refreshing beverage on his porch. The fact that he tells himself something after taking a sip of lemonade indicates that he is taking a moment to reflect on his life. The word "good" is a positive descriptor that conveys a sense of contentment and satisfaction with his life at that moment. The other options ("ending soon," "fleeting," "finite," "important") do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest a more negative or uncertain outlook on life.
Answer:
good
Question: The trim made a good line between the floor and the what?
Options: A) obesity, B) desk, C) sky, D) wall, E) ceiling,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trim is separating two surfaces and the options that could be separated by a line would be a wall and a floor. The other options, such as obesity or sky, do not correlate with the context of the sentence. Similarly, a desk does not necessarily require a trim to divide it from the floor, and the ceiling is usually separated from the floor by a wall rather than a trim.
Answer:
wall
Question: Where would you fire a projectile ball at a clown's mouth?
Options: A) flintlock, B) tennis court, C) at home, D) motion, E) arcade,
Knowledge: The question implies that firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth is a game that can be played. This game is typically found in arcades as a carnival or circus themed attraction. The other options do not provide any context related to the game's setting, so they are unlikely to be correct answers.
Answer:
arcade
Question: The guy was going to bed instead of going to work, what does he suffer from?
Options: A) money, B) making love, C) laziness, D) dreaming of, E) falling asleep,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the guy is choosing to go to bed instead of going to work, indicating a lack of motivation or productivity. This could be explained by laziness, as the other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Money" and "making love" do not seem relevant, while "dreaming of" and "falling asleep" suggest unconscious actions rather than a conscious decision to skip work.
Answer:
laziness
Question: What low area between mountains can an apple tree be typically found?
Options: A) valley, B) washington state, C) open, D) countryside, E) fields,
Knowledge: Apple trees are commonly associated with growing in valley regions, where the climate is cool and mild with moderate rainfall. This environment provides ample growing conditions for apple trees, which require well-drained soil and good air circulation. The other options, such as Washington State or open fields, do not necessarily indicate a specific area where apple trees are commonly found.
Answer:
valley
Question: Playing piano and other creative activities need what?
Options: A) make music, B) inspiration, C) musical sounds, D) making music, E) dancing,
Knowledge: The sentence is talking about creative activities, specifically playing the piano. Inspiration is often a key component in any artistic endeavor, and playing the piano is no exception. While making music and creating musical sounds are important aspects of playing the piano, the sentence is asking for a broader term that encompasses all creative activities. Dancing is not related to playing the piano at all, and "make music" and "making music" are essentially the same answer with different phrasing.
Answer:
inspiration
Question: What happens after committing murder?
Options: A) distress, B) kill, C) problems, D) go to jail, E) fear,
Knowledge: Committing murder is a serious crime that typically results in the perpetrator being sentenced to jail time. While the other options may be associated with murder in some way, such as feeling distress or fear before or after the act, or experiencing problems as a result of their actions, going to jail is the most direct and likely consequence of committing murder.
Answer:
go to jail
Question: What is the path of the earth around the sun called?
Options: A) fotograph, B) orbit, C) tree, D) solar system, E) attraction,
Knowledge: The question is asking for the specific term used to describe the path of the earth around the sun. "Orbit" is the correct answer because it refers specifically to the elliptical path that a celestial body takes around a larger body, such as the earth's path around the sun. "Fotograph," "tree," "solar system," and "attraction" are not related to the earth's motion around the sun, and therefore are not the correct answer.
Answer:
orbit
Question: Where would you put a vase on your wall?
Options: A) cabinet, B) windowsill, C) table, D) fall off shelf, E) shelf,
Knowledge: The question asks about where to put a vase on the wall, which suggests that the vase needs to be elevated and supported. A cabinet or table would not be on the wall, and a windowsill may not be sturdy enough to hold a vase. "Fall off shelf" is not a suitable option. "Shelf" is the most appropriate choice as it provides a surface to hold the vase and is mounted on the wall.
Answer:
shelf
Question: What are humans doing when they have offspring?
Options: A) regret, B) drive cars, C) hear sounds, D) make mistakes, E) reproduce,
Knowledge: Reproduction is the biological process by which organisms create descendants. Humans, like most other animals, reproduce sexually, meaning they produce offspring through the union of male and female reproductive cells. The other choices (regret, drive cars, hear sounds, make mistakes) do not relate to the biological process of reproduction.
Answer:
reproduce
Question: The robber wanted to conceal his pistol, where did he put it?
Options: A) police station, B) war, C) police officer's belt, D) river, E) pants,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the robber wanted to hide his pistol, which is something that could easily be done by placing it in a location that is not visible to others. The option "police station" is unlikely because it's a place where guns are kept secure, whereas the robber wants to keep his gun hidden. "War" is also an unlikely option as it doesn't have any clear connection to the sentence. "Police officer's belt" might be a possible answer, but the sentence doesn't provide any context to suggest that the robber was near a police officer or had access to their belt. "River" is also unlikely as it would be an inconvenient and ineffective place to hide a gun.
Answer:
pants
Question: Where in a house would a table be most likely placed?
Options: A) living room, B) kitchen, C) dining room, D) conference, E) demonstration,
Knowledge: A table is commonly used for dining and therefore would most likely be placed in a dining room. While a table could be found in other areas such as a living room or kitchen, those spaces are not primarily used for dining purposes. The options "conference" and "demonstration" are not typically associated with a household setting and are unlikely choices.
Answer:
dining room
Question: The person was always using mouthwash, why were they doing that?
Options: A) headache, B) to quench thirst, C) white teeth, D) source of income, E) fair trial,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was using mouthwash regularly for a specific reason. One common reason for using mouthwash is to promote dental hygiene and achieve white teeth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
white teeth
Question: What type of person wants to get in shape?
Options: A) look attractive, B) overweight, C) sex, D) bowel movements, E) feel good,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the desire to get in shape is motivated by a need to address a physical condition - being overweight. While there may be other reasons why someone wants to get in shape, such as wanting to look attractive or feel good, the statement specifically references a physical condition. The other options - sex and bowel movements - are unrelated to the topic of getting in shape.
Answer:
overweight
Question: What vehicle uses a tow chain?
Options: A) motorbike, B) jewelry store, C) tow truck, D) trailer, E) gear shift,
Knowledge: The use of a tow chain implies that the vehicle is capable of towing something behind it, which rules out options like motorbike and jewelry store. The term "trailer" also suggests a vehicle that is designed for towing, but it is not explicitly stated that a tow chain is used with a trailer. Gear shift does not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Therefore, tow truck is the most likely answer.
Answer:
tow truck
Question: What's black and white and contains many a story?
Options: A) past, B) book or magazine, C) novel, D) newspaper, E) story book,
Knowledge: The phrase "contains many a story" suggests that the answer is a publication that regularly features multiple stories. While books, magazines, and novels can contain multiple stories, they are typically not black and white. Story books may be black and white, but they are not typically associated with containing multiple stories on a regular basis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is newspaper, which is traditionally black and white and contains a variety of news stories.
Answer:
newspaper
Question: Several other people were standing around James.  They were jumping up and down, screaming loudly, and banging their heads.  Where might James have been?
Options: A) water, B) in class, C) meeting, D) mall, E) concert,
Knowledge: The actions described in the sentence (jumping up and down, screaming loudly, banging their heads) suggest a high-energy and exciting environment, which is commonly associated with concerts. The other options do not fit this context - "water" is too vague, "in class" and "meeting" are unlikely to involve such behavior, and the "mall" is an unusual place for people to act this way.
Answer:
concert
Question: Where does water enter in a dam to create electricity?
Options: A) wet clothes, B) power turbine, C) cracks, D) thin soup, E) dribble,
Knowledge: Dams are typically built across rivers or other bodies of water to create a large reservoir that can be used to generate electricity. Water enters the dam through an intake valve or gate and flows into a penstock, which is a large pipe that carries the water to the power turbine. The force of the water in the penstock turns the blades of the turbine, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity. Wet clothes, cracks, thin soup, and dribble are not related to the process of generating electricity in a dam.
Answer:
power turbine
Question: During battle he felt great anger, this drove him to do what?
Options: A) drive car, B) destroy enemy, C) punch, D) release energy, E) write letter,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question was involved in a battle and felt a strong emotion that influenced their actions. Anger is commonly associated with aggression and a desire to harm others, which may explain why the person was driven to destroy their enemy. The other options do not make sense in the context of a battle where anger is present.
Answer:
destroy enemy
Question: What is one likely trying to find an answer for when something is broken?
Options: A) question, B) wrong, C) problem, D) swear, E) confusion,
Knowledge: When something is broken, it is typically not working as it should, indicating that there is a problem. Therefore, someone who is trying to find an answer for a situation where something is broken is likely looking for a way to fix the problem. The other options do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context of something being broken.
Answer:
problem
Question: Billy liked seeing new teachers at school.   He enjoyed meeting new people, but didn't care about the quality of his what?
Options: A) excitement, B) university of chicago, C) fear, D) envy, E) education,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy likes seeing new teachers because he enjoys meeting new people. However, it also implies that Billy doesn't care about the quality of his education, as this is not mentioned in the sentence. The other options, such as excitement or envy, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The option "University of Chicago" is not relevant to the sentence, since it is not mentioned whether Billy attends or aspires to attend this institution.
Answer:
education
Question: What can you do to a door but not to a jar?
Options: A) found at shower, B) opened, C) found up store, D) closed, E) locked,
Knowledge: This question is asking for a verb that can only be applied to a door and not to a jar. The answer is "locked" because you can lock a door using a key, padlock, or other devices, but you can't lock a jar as it typically does not have a locking mechanism. The other options, such as "closed" or "opened," are applicable to both doors and jars.
Answer:
locked
Question: Billy was a student taking a course in communications.  Where might he be taking his classes?
Options: A) every aspect of life, B) library, C) in a movie hall, D) classroom, E) university,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Billy is a student taking a course, which implies that he is enrolled in an educational institution. The other options (every aspect of life, library, in a movie hall, classroom) do not necessarily suggest an academic setting. The option "university" is the most likely answer as it is a common place for students to take courses in communications.
Answer:
university
Question: Driving to work had become a chore for her and she felt what at the slightest hint of traffic?
Options: A) promotion, B) pressure, C) busy, D) getting there, E) impatience,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is frustrated with driving to work, specifically with traffic. The use of the word "chore" implies that it is something she does not enjoy, and the mention of traffic hints at a potential cause of her frustration. The word "impatience" fits into this context as it is a common feeling associated with waiting in traffic. The other options do not make sense in this context or are not closely related to the situation described in the sentence.
Answer:
impatience
Question: He feels like just a cog in a machine or just a number in a cubicle when he is working where?
Options: A) planner, B) math book, C) office, D) mathematics, E) phonebook,

Options: A) tired feet, B) pondering, C) gaining knowledge, D) exhilaration, E) wonder,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny spent all day at the museum looking at exhibits, indicating that he was on his feet for an extended period. Additionally, the sentence mentions that he studied the exhibits carefully, indicating that he was likely moving around and engaging with the exhibits. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that he might have gone home due to tiredness in his feet from standing and walking all day. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.

Knowledge: The question is asking where you could find out more information about a type of lizard, which suggests you need to look for a source of information. The options "garden floor," "rocks," "bushes," and "garden" do not provide any clear sources of information, while "books" is a commonly used source for research and learning. Additionally, books may contain detailed descriptions of different types of lizards, including their habitat, behavior, and physical characteristics.
Answer:
books
Question: Where would a doctor rush to?
Options: A) nursing home, B) sick patients, C) dentist, D) emergency room, E) golf course,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a doctor would "rush" somewhere, which implies that there is an urgent need for medical attention. The only choice that reflects an urgent medical situation is the emergency room. A nursing home typically has patients who require long-term care, and while a dentist may be necessary for some urgent dental situations, it is not likely that a doctor would rush to a dental office. The same applies to sick patients in general. The golf course is not related to any medical event.
Answer:
emergency room

Options: A) medicine cabinet, B) barber shop, C) bath room, D) grocery store, E) suitcase,

Options: A) tardiness, B) neatness, C) bathe, D) late, E) looking good,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was trying to improve his appearance in order to attract women. The goal of grooming is often to enhance one's appearance by being neat, clean, and well-dressed. The options "tardiness" and "late" have no relevance to the context, while "bathe" is a basic hygiene practice and doesn't necessarily imply an effort to look more attractive. "Neatness" is a possibility, but "looking good" is a more direct and accurate answer given the context of attracting women.
Answer:
looking good
Question: The clerk had a paper sign, where did he put it?
Options: A) hallway, B) public place, C) toilet, D) shop window, E) store window,
Knowledge: The use of the word "clerk" implies that the sign was posted in a commercial setting, rather than a hallway or toilet. Additionally, the fact that the sign was made of paper suggests that it was not intended to be a permanent fixture, so it is likely that the clerk put it in a location with high visibility to draw attention to a sale or promotion. The options "public place" and "hallway" are too general to suggest a specific location, while "toilet" is unlikely for a promotional sign. Therefore, "store window" is the most logical choice.
Answer:
store window
Question: On the hot day, they liked to eat  ice cream, what was their goal?
Options: A) were hungry, B) cool down, C) get full, D) depressed, E) let melt in mouth,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the characters in the sentence were looking for relief from the heat, which is commonly associated with the goal of cooling down. Eating ice cream is a common way to cool down on a hot day, as the cold temperature of the treat can help to lower body temperature. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
cool down
Question: What institution are you trying to dissolve if you're getting a divorce?
Options: A) court, B) marriage, C) being married, D) two people, E) lawyer,
Knowledge: Divorce is the legal process of ending a marriage, so the institution being dissolved in a divorce is the marriage itself. The other choices either do not accurately describe the situation or are not directly related to the legal process of divorce.
Answer:
marriage
Question: If I'm at the doctor's office looking for a good title, what sort of story am I looking to read?
Options: A) book, B) magazine article, C) safe deposit box, D) hotel menu book, E) library,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is looking for something to read while waiting at the doctor's office. The most likely option from the choices provided would be a magazine article, as these are often found in waiting rooms and cover a variety of topics that can be read quickly. The other options do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence, as a safe deposit box, hotel menu book, and library are not things that one typically finds in a doctor's office, and the word "book" is too general and could refer to anything.
Answer:
magazine article
Question: When you are eating a meal you normally place a cup on this.
Options: A) dishwasher, B) table, C) shelf, D) coaster, E) closet,
Knowledge: The sentence describes a common practice when eating a meal, which is to place a cup on a surface. The most likely surface for this action is a table, which is used for dining and typically has enough space to accommodate a cup. The other options do not make sense in this context - a dishwasher is used for cleaning dishes, a shelf is usually elevated and not a good surface for placing cups, a coaster is specifically designed for cups but may not always be available, and a closet is not a surface for placing cups at all.
Answer:
table
Question: Why is someone likely to use an iron when cleaning clothes?
Options: A) wrinkles, B) sanitation, C) attractive appearance, D) looks good, E) ruined,
Knowledge: Ironing clothes is a common practice to remove wrinkles and creases that may have formed during washing, drying, or storage. The heat and pressure from the iron help to smooth out the fabric and give it a crisp appearance. Sanitation is not a primary reason for using an iron, although ironing can help to kill bacteria and freshen up clothes. "Attractive appearance" and "looks good" are essentially the same as removing wrinkles. "Ruined" is the opposite of the intended result.
Answer:
wrinkles
Question: Which door with lock holds valuables?
Options: A) safe, B) vault, C) garage, D) house, E) automobile,
Knowledge: A safe is a secure container typically used to store valuable items such as cash, jewelry, and important documents.

The other options do not typically have locks and are not commonly associated with storing valuables in the same way that a safe is.
Answer:
safe

Options: A) england, B) tea, C) cupboard, D) water, E) japanese tea room,
Knowledge: A teakettle is commonly used for boiling water, which is an essential step in preparing tea.

The other options do not have any clear relevance to the context of the question.
Answer:
water
Question: What does someone do when there are dishes astray in the kitchen?
Options: A) gain weight, B) wait patiently, C) stand erect, D) promise to do, E) washing dishes,
Knowledge: The word "astray" suggests that the dishes are not in their proper place or are dirty, which would require someone to clean them. The only option that directly relates to cleaning dishes is washing dishes, while the other choices do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
washing dishes
Question: The dream was so terrible, what did the dreamer do?
Options: A) reality, B) nightmare, C) park, D) dreamworker, E) awake,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dream was unpleasant or frightening, which would make the dreamer want to wake up and escape from the dream. The other options do not fit the context, as they do not relate to the dream being terrible or the dreamer wanting to escape from it.
Answer:
awake
Question: The library wanted to get the community more involved, so they began to screen family what?
Options: A) monitor, B) homes, C) drive in movie, D) theatre, E) movies,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the library was seeking to increase community engagement, and one way they did this was by screening a particular type of film. The options "monitor" and "homes" do not make sense in this context, while "drive in movie" and "theatre" are more specific locations for screening movies. "Movies" is the most general option and fits best with the sentence.
Answer:
movies
Question: Where would you carry food while on a long walk in the countryside?
Options: A) backpack, B) table, C) jar, D) box, E) container,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the food needs to be carried along on a long walk, and the most common way to do so would be in a backpack or a similar bag. The other options, such as a table or a jar, do not make sense in this context as they are not practical for carrying food on a long walk in the countryside. A box or a container may work, but a backpack is generally the most convenient and popular choice.
Answer:
backpack
Question: She was there for for just one location and one pair of jeans, but she spent hours looking at everything and anything in the what?
Options: A) clothing store, B) shopping plaza, C) shopping mall, D) laundromat, E) thrift store,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was looking for a specific item in a larger shopping area, which is commonly found in shopping malls. Clothing stores, thrift stores, and laundromats are not typically found in a shopping mall and would not require hours of browsing. A shopping plaza could be a possibility, but the term "shopping mall" is more commonly used to describe a large indoor shopping area with multiple stores.
Answer:
shopping mall
Question: Where do you keep perishable food for a longer time?
Options: A) table, B) trash can, C) store, D) freezer, E) home,
Knowledge: Perishable food needs to be kept at a low temperature to extend its shelf life. The only option that provides a low temperature is the freezer, making it the correct answer. The other options either do not provide a low temperature or are not suitable for storing food.
Answer:
freezer

Options: A) hotel, B) cave, C) jungle, D) maze, E) freeway,
Knowledge: When someone rents a room, it is typically in a hotel or other lodging establishment, where the passageway to the room would be located within the building.

Answer:
hotel
Question: Where would you keep a canoe?
Options: A) boat house, B) mountain stream, C) water, D) garage, E) campground,
Knowledge: A canoe is a type of boat that is typically used for recreational activities on bodies of water such as lakes and rivers. Therefore, it is logical to store a canoe in a place that is specifically designed for boats, such as a boat house. The other options, such as a mountain stream or campground, may be places where a canoe could be used, but they are not necessarily places where one would store a canoe. A garage may be an alternative option, but it is less common than a boat house for storing boats.
Answer:
boat house

Options: A) talk, B) relaxation, C) excitement, D) fun, E) joy,
Knowledge: The question is asking about the emotional state you might experience when meeting a friend whose company you greatly enjoy. Joy is a positive emotion commonly associated with feelings of happiness and pleasure. The other options may also be associated with meeting a friend, but do not necessarily capture the specific emotional response suggested in the question. Talking, relaxation, excitement, and fun could all be present in a positive social encounter, but do not necessarily capture the emotional response.
Answer:
joy
Question: Where should shoes not be?
Options: A) walking, B) closet, C) suitcase, D) table, E) bed,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where shoes should not be placed. The options include walking, which is an activity rather than a location, and closet and suitcase, which are both common places to store shoes. The options of table and bed are both flat surfaces where shoes could easily be placed, but it is generally considered inappropriate to put shoes on either of these surfaces. Therefore, the correct answer is table.
Answer:
table
Question: He found it odd that while attending lecture the professor got preachy, and even weirder when his fellow students started to what?
Options: A) applaud, B) laughed, C) learning, D) taking notes, E) fall asleep,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the professor began to preach during the lecture and the other students reacted in a way that the speaker found odd. Applauding is a possible reaction to a speaker who is perceived as inspiring or motivating, so it makes sense that the students started to applaud. Laughing or taking notes would not necessarily be an unusual response, and falling asleep would not be a reaction to a professor becoming preachy. Learning is also not considered an unusual reaction to attending a lecture.
Answer:
applaud
Question: Why would you be doing housework?
Options: A) cleanliness, B) allergies, C) joy, D) exhaustion, E) boredom,
Knowledge: Housework is typically done to maintain a clean and organized living space. Allergies may also be a reason to clean, but it wouldn't necessarily be the main focus of the question. Joy or exhaustion may not be the primary motivation for doing housework, and boredom isn't necessarily a reason to clean, as there are many other things one could do to alleviate boredom.
Answer:
cleanliness
Question: Where is a catwalk unlikely to be?
Options: A) theater, B) airplane, C) theatre, D) new york city, E) fieldhouse,
Knowledge: A catwalk typically refers to a narrow elevated platform used for walking, which is commonly found in theaters or on airplanes for crew members. New York City is a possible location for a catwalk, but it is not specific enough to determine its likelihood. A fieldhouse, on the other hand, is more likely to be an indoor sports facility with a large open space, making it an unlikely location for a catwalk. Therefore, the correct answer is fieldhouse.
Answer:
fieldhouse
Question: Where is known for powerful storms from the ocean?
Options: A) rain, B) weather report, C) tropics, D) summer, E) america,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location being referred to is known for strong storms that originate from the ocean.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
tropics
Question: Where is sugar stored when it's not needed?
Options: A) coffee, B) bank locker, C) cupboard, D) every home, E) candy bar,
Knowledge: Sugar is typically stored in cupboards or pantries in homes and kitchens, as it is a common ingredient used in cooking and baking. Coffee, bank lockers, and candy bars do not typically serve as storage locations for household sugar. "Every home" is too broad and vague to be a specific answer to this question, as sugar may be stored in a variety of places within a home.
Answer:
cupboard
Question: Where would you display a picture on a vertical surface?
Options: A) shelf, B) desktop, C) editer, D) wall, E) art show,
Knowledge: A vertical surface typically refers to a surface that stands upright, like a wall. Pictures are commonly displayed on walls using nails, hooks, or other hanging devices. The other options- shelf, desktop, editer, and art show- do not necessarily refer to vertical surfaces where pictures would commonly be displayed.

Question: If you fell in front of people while going public store how might you feel?
Options: A) problems, B) sorrow, C) embarrassment, D) happy, E) panic,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that falling in front of people while going to a public store may cause a person to feel a certain way. The word "felt" is in the past tense, suggesting that the person has already experienced this. The word "embarrassment" is the best answer because falling in front of people can be a humiliating experience that may make a person feel self-conscious or awkward. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotions that a person in this situation would feel.
Answer:
embarrassment
Question: What could happen to you if someone threatens to charge you with obstructing justice, even if he or she does not do it?
Options: A) get arrested, B) fear, C) getting arrested, D) going to jail, E) fined,
Knowledge: The question asks what could happen if someone threatens to charge you with obstructing justice, not what the actual consequences would be if you were charged with obstructing justice. Therefore, none of the options involve actual legal consequences such as being fined or going to jail. However, being threatened can certainly cause fear or anxiety, which is the closest option to the question being asked.
Answer:
fear
Question: The automobile was left outside when the man got home from work, where was i left?
Options: A) exit ramp, B) repair shop, C) driveway, D) front yard, E) garage,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man left his car outside when he got home from work. The options "exit ramp" and "repair shop" do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they relate to locations outside of the man's home. "Front yard" is a possibility, but "driveway" is a more specific and likely answer since it is a common area to leave a car parked outside of one's home. "Garage" could also be a possibility but the sentence implies that the car was not put away in the garage.
Answer:
driveway
Question: Where might a student store a pencil when traveling
Options: A) backpack, B) desktop, C) classroom, D) desk drawer, E) pocket,
Knowledge: The question is about where a student might store a pencil while traveling, which suggests that the answer should be a portable, convenient option. A backpack is a common choice for students to carry their school supplies in, especially when traveling or on the go. The other options, such as desktop or desk drawer, are stationary and not suitable for traveling. Pocket may be an option, but it depends on the size of the pencil and the type of clothing being worn, which adds uncertainty to the answer.
Answer:
backpack
Question: What kind of call are you on if you're hearing several people over speakers?
Options: A) desktop, B) headphones, C) connect, D) concert, E) conference,

A conference call is a type of phone call that allows multiple participants to join in from different locations. The other options, such as desktop or headphones, don't necessarily have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
conference

Options: A) car seats, B) department stores, C) stable, D) merry go round, E) handbag,
Knowledge: Leather horseback riding equipment, such as saddles, bridles, and boots, are typically found at stables or equestrian supply stores. They are used specifically in the context of horseback riding, so options like car seats or handbags do not make sense. Department stores may have some equestrian equipment, but it would likely be limited in selection. Merry go rounds also have no connection to horseback riding equipment.
Answer:
stable

Options: A) enjoy film, B) make bread, C) go to the gym, D) stay in bed, E) write,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill likes to do creative things on rainy days and that he loves to taste things. Making bread is a creative activity that involves tasting and experimenting with different flavors and ingredients. The other options (enjoy film, go to the gym, stay in bed, write) do not have any obvious connection to the context of the sentence, so they are less likely to be correct.
Answer:
make bread

Answer:

Question: What is a kind of literature?
Options: A) newspaper, B) books and magazines, C) own home, D) public library, E) good homes,
Knowledge: Literature refers to written works that have artistic or intellectual value, including books, poems, plays, and essays. Newspapers may contain written works, but they are considered more of a source of news and information rather than literature. "Own home" and "good homes" do not make sense as options as they are not related to literature. A public library may contain literature, but it is not necessarily a type of literature itself. "Books and magazines" is the best answer as it directly refers to written works that are a part of literature.
Answer:
books and magazines
Question: The place felt wrong, but higher up had said this was the right what?
Options: A) job, B) map, C) location, D) line, E) almost anywhere,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is some discrepancy between how the place feels and what someone higher up has said. This implies that there is some uncertainty or confusion about the correct location. The other options do not make sense in this context - a job, map, line, or almost anywhere would not create the same sense of uncertainty or conflict.
Answer:
location

Options: A) drunkenness, B) enjoyment, C) have fun, D) hang over, E) fighting,

Answer:
drunkenness

Options: A) coma, B) falling down, C) pain, D) death, E) forgetfulness,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is experiencing unexpected episodes of unconsciousness, which is a common symptom of a concussion. Additionally, the sentence states that he is also suffering from something else. The word "annoying" implies that whatever he is experiencing is more of an inconvenience than a serious medical issue. The option "coma" and "death" are both extreme and do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Falling down" and "pain" could be related to a concussion, but they do not fit with the idea of him losing consciousness at annoying times. "Forgetfulness" is a common symptom of a concussion and fits well with the context of the sentence.
Answer:
forgetfulness

Options: A) do work, B) help people, C) compute, D) networked, E) crash,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a computer has stopped working, which is commonly referred to as a "crash". The other options do not accurately describe the situation of a computer not working. "Do work" and "help people" are too general and don't specifically relate to computers. "Compute" is a verb that describes what a computer does, but it does not describe the situation of a computer not working. "Networked" describes a type of computer connection, but it does not describe the situation of a computer not working.
Answer:
crash
Question: If I need to store old stuff out of the way without concerns of them getting damp, where do I go?
Options: A) waste bin, B) cellar, C) attic, D) fridge, E) museum,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker needs to store old items in a place where they will not get damp, which suggests a dry and elevated location. A common place for this type of storage is an attic, which is typically a dry and insulated space located above the main living areas of a house. The other options are unlikely choices for storing old items, as a waste bin would not be suitable for preserving items or protecting them from dampness, a cellar may be too damp, a fridge is too small and not used for storage of non-food items, and a museum would not be accessible for personal use.
Answer:
attic

Options: A) garden, B) useful for recycling, C) surface of earth, D) forest, E) orchard,

Answer:
forest

Options: A) happiness, B) embarrassment, C) fatigue, D) fulfillment, E) enjoyment,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman's behavior was not socially acceptable, as she was yelling obscenities in public. Therefore, her husband is likely to feel embarrassed by her actions, as they reflect on both her and him as a couple. The word "entertaining" implies that others found the situation amusing, but it does not provide any information about the husband's feelings. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
embarrassment
Question: These days, what is the one place you are guaranteed to find a telephone?
Options: A) television, B) party, C) friend's house, D) office, E) desktop,

Options: A) to be alone, B) believe in god, C) enjoy themselves, D) face each other, E) group together,
Knowledge: A party is generally a social event, and people usually attend parties to have fun and enjoy themselves with others. The other options do not make sense in the context of attending a party. "To be alone" contradicts the purpose of a party, which is to socialize, and "believe in god" is not necessarily related to attending a party. "Face each other" and "group together" are vague and do not provide a clear reason for attending a party.
Answer:
enjoy themselves

Answer:
commercial building

Therefore, the most common thing someone will tell you when you let them know that you are going to watch your favorite team play is to have fun. The other options may also be appropriate, but they do not capture the essence of the experience as effectively as "have fun."
Answer:

Question: If you wanted to move cargo at a low price and time wasn't an issue, what vehicle would you use?
Options: A) train, B) boat, C) airplane, D) ship's hold, E) train,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the priority is moving cargo at a low price, which suggests that the most affordable option would be the best choice. Boats are often used for transporting cargo as they are generally cheaper to operate than airplanes or trains, especially for large quantities of goods. Ships' holds are simply a part of a ship and cannot be used as a mode of transport. The other answer choices are either more expensive to use or prioritize speed over affordability.

Options: A) newspaper, B) writer's brain, C) own home, D) library, E) book store,
Knowledge: A library is a place specifically dedicated to housing a large collection of books and other written materials. It is designed for people to read, study and research, therefore it is likely that someone could find a huge amount of text in a library. The other options do not have the same kind of association with large quantities of text, such as a newspaper being limited to a single issue or a writer's brain being limited by their own capacity to create.
Answer:
library

Options: A) hallway, B) store window, C) pole, D) public place, E) shop window,
Knowledge: The phrase "civic meeting" suggests that the meeting is open to the public and therefore, the paper sign advertising the meeting should be posted in a public place where it can be easily seen by individuals passing by. The other options may not be as visible to the general public or may not be appropriate for posting public notices.
Answer:
public place
Question: Where are you if you've received bbq after paying?
Options: A) ribs, B) backyard, C) texas, D) restaurant, E) louisiana,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where one can pay for food, which rules out options like backyard, texas, and louisiana. The mention of bbq and paying for it indicates that it is likely a restaurant that serves this type of cuisine. Ribs is a type of bbq, but it does not answer the question of where you are located. Therefore, the correct answer is restaurant.
Answer:
restaurant

Options: A) countryside, B) city, C) national park, D) special place, E) forest,
Knowledge: Natural landmarks are typically preserved in national parks, which are designated areas set aside for the purpose of conserving natural resources and protecting unique features.

Options: A) entertained, B) plug in, C) you're bored, D) see favorite show, E) sit,

Question: Most people would think killing people is what kind of act?
Options: A) going to jail, B) joy, C) terrible, D) mistake, E) murder,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that killing people is not a desirable or acceptable behavior, which is reflected in the word "terrible." Going to jail is a consequence of committing a crime, but it does not reflect the moral or ethical position on the act itself. Joy would not be an appropriate association with killing people, as most people would not feel happy or joyful about taking someone else's life. Mistake implies that the act was unintentional, which may not be the case in this context. Murder is a synonym for killing, but it carries additional legal and moral connotations that may not apply universally.
Answer:
terrible
Question: Walking to much with poorly fitting shoes can cause what?
Options: A) weight gain, B) blisters, C) exercise, D) locomotion, E) lose weight,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the consequence of walking too much with poorly fitting shoes will be mentioned.

Answer:
blisters
Question: Washing clothes over and over many times what do they do?
Options: A) transmutate, B) wear out, C) torn, D) get wet, E) wet clothes,
Knowledge: The phrase "washing clothes over and over many times" suggests repetitive use or action, which can lead to wear and tear on the clothes. Clothes that are washed too often or too vigorously can lose their shape, fade, or become thin and fragile. "Transmutate," "torn," and "get wet" are not related to the context of washing clothes, while "wet clothes" is redundant and doesn't provide an answer to the question.
Answer:
wear out

Knowledge: The sentence describes a type of performance on TV that aims to promote the purchase of a certain product.

Answer:
commercial

Options: A) wires, B) freeway, C) electrical circuit, D) wall, E) airport,

Question: If a person has one of every kind of a thing, what do they have?
Options: A) complete collection, B) have to hold, C) hobby, D) procrastinate, E) acknowledgment,
Knowledge: The phrase "one of every kind" suggests that the person has gathered a complete set of something, which is commonly referred to as a collection. The other options do not make sense in the context of having one of every kind of something. "Have to hold" and "procrastinate" are verbs that don't fit the sentence structure, "hobby" is a noun that could potentially fit but doesn't accurately describe the person's possession, and "acknowledgment" is a completely unrelated concept.
Answer:
complete collection
Question: The jaw skeleton of the shark was on display for the children to walk through, it was one of the many attractions where?
Options: A) tomales bay, B) football ground, C) business, D) pool hall, E) marine museum,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the jaw skeleton of a shark was on display for children to walk through, making it likely that this is an attraction at a place where marine animals are displayed or studied. The option "marine museum" is the only choice that fits this context, while the other choices have no clear connection to the sentence.
Answer:
marine museum
Question: He wanted to but couldn't concentrate on playing game with friends, he wished he could just be doing what with it?

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was unable to concentrate on playing a game with friends due to some kind of obstacle or distraction, and that they wished they could be doing something else with it instead. The word "enjoying" fits this context because it suggests that the person would rather be having fun playing the game with their friends instead of struggling to concentrate. The other options ("gaming," "anger," "stress," and "injury") do not fit this context as well, and do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
enjoying

Options: A) fall asleep, B) flatulence, C) sigh of relief, D) medium, E) comfort,

The other options do not make sense in the context of someone sitting on a whoopee cushion.
Answer:
flatulence

Options: A) airport, B) restaurant, C) change planes, D) apartment building, E) stairwell,
Knowledge: The word "landing" suggests that the traveler is on a mode of transportation that is capable of landing, such as an airplane. Additionally, the use of the word "convenience" implies that the traveler is referring to a transportation hub such as an airport, where there are many options for connecting flights or ground transportation. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not involve modes of transportation that "land".
Answer:
airport

Playing dead is a common survival strategy when confronted with a potential threat, and may help to prevent a dog from attacking if it believes the threat is no longer present. The other options, such as being a cat or being black, do not provide any clear solution to the problem of avoiding getting bitten by a dog.
Answer:
playing dead
Question: What is good way to break boredom for kids?
Options: A) play chess, B) play games, C) play basket, D) play cards, E) watch film,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a good way to break boredom for kids. Out of the given choices, "play games" would be the most effective as it allows children to engage in a variety of activities that may cater to their interests and provide entertainment. Chess, basket, and cards require a specific skill set and may not be suitable for all children, while watching a film is a more passive activity that may not keep their attention for very long.
Answer:
play games

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jamie had to leave work because of low serotonin levels, which is commonly associated with depression.

Answer:

Question: He had a very expensive writing instrument in his office and didn't want to lose it, where did he put it?
Options: A) writer's hand, B) desk drawer, C) pawn shop, D) pocket, E) classroom,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person has a valuable writing instrument and wants to keep it safe. One common place to store valuable items in an office is a desk drawer. The other options are less likely because they either do not provide a secure location (such as a writer's hand, pocket, or classroom) or involve getting rid of the item altogether (such as a pawn shop).
Answer:
desk drawer
Question: Why did his eyes close and he begin to snore while listening to music that was quiet?
Options: A) relaxation, B) fall asleep, C) deafness, D) resting, E) calm,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person listening to the quiet music began to snore and close their eyes, indicating that they may have fallen asleep. Quiet music is often associated with relaxation and calm, which could have contributed to the person's drowsiness. Deafness and resting do not have clear connections to the context of the sentence, while relaxation and calm are similar in meaning to fall asleep but do not explain why the person started snoring.
Answer:
fall asleep
Question: The token was being wished upon desperately, where was it bound for?
Options: A) coin collection, B) loans, C) ashtray, D) slot machine, E) pocket,
Knowledge: The phrase "wished upon" suggests that the token has some kind of superstitious or magical significance. The options "coin collection," "loans," and "ashtray" do not fit this context, as they are not associated with wishing. "Pocket" could be a possibility, but it doesn't explain why the token is being desperately wished upon. "Slot machine," however, is a common object for people to make wishes on by giving it a "lucky" coin or token before playing, making it the most likely choice.
Answer:
slot machine
Question: Curiosity got him out of his small hometown, he simply wanted to what?
Options: A) analyse, B) die, C) go somewhere, D) see favorite show, E) read book,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person was curious and wanted to leave their small hometown, which implies a desire to explore and experience new things. The phrase "go somewhere" is the only option that fits this context, as the other options do not relate to travel or exploration. "Analyse," "die," and "read book" are all too specific or unrelated, while "see favorite show" may imply a desire to escape one's current location, but does not necessarily suggest a sense of curiosity or exploration.
Answer:
go somewhere
Question: Why do people want to have fun?
Options: A) have sex, B) enjoy yourself, C) waste time, D) laughter, E) spontaneous,
Knowledge: The choices all relate to the concept of having fun, but only "enjoy yourself" captures the general positive feeling associated with having fun. "Have sex" is a specific type of activity that some people may enjoy for fun, but it does not encompass the full range of activities that people do for fun. "Waste time" has a negative connotation and suggests that fun is a frivolous or unproductive use of time, which is not necessarily true. "Laughter" and "spontaneous" are also related to having fun, but they are more specific and do not capture the broad motivation for why people want to have fun.
Answer:
enjoy yourself
Question: After taking my final exams I got my grades back and had  a 4.0 gpa, how did I feel?
Options: A) graduation, B) headaches, C) fail again, D) success, E) failure,

Therefore, it can be inferred that the person was feeling successful after receiving their grades. The other options are not congruent with the context of the sentence, as graduation is not mentioned and headaches or failing again would likely not be associated with a perfect GPA.
Answer:
success

Options: A) dry skin, B) nudity, C) cleanliness, D) use soap, E) having a strong scent,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan's mother emphasized the importance of bathing, which would be primarily for hygiene purposes. The option "cleanliness" directly relates to hygiene and therefore would be the correct answer. The other options either do not directly or indirectly relate to the context of the sentence or are erroneous (such as "nudity" being an outcome of bathing).
Answer:
cleanliness
Question: The cow was a star.  Everyone knew it from the what?
Options: A) wisconsin, B) fairy tale, C) nebraska, D) advertisement, E) countryside,

Options: A) loud, B) beautiful, C) sound, D) george michael, E) commmunicating,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a great singer's voice is going to possess certain qualities. While volume may be important for some styles of singing, the use of the word "beautiful" implies that this is the primary characteristic being referred to here.

Answer:
beautiful
Question: What can you do in your house during the winter?
Options: A) ski, B) skate, C) play hockey, D) blaze it, E) knit,
Knowledge: The question is asking about indoor activities that can be done during the winter, which suggests that the correct answer should involve something that can be done inside the house. Skiing, skating, and playing hockey are outdoor winter sports that require specific equipment and spaces, so they are unlikely to be done inside the house. "Blaze it" is a non sequitur and has no relation to the question. Knitting, on the other hand, is a common indoor hobby, and it is a popular winter activity for many people.
Answer:
knit
Question: The extrovert didn't mind talking to the stranger, to him it was half the fun to him of taking public transportation to school and waiting at the what?
Options: A) town, B) park, C) bus station, D) train station, E) taxi stand,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the extrovert enjoys interacting with strangers while taking public transportation to school.

The park and town do not have any connection to public transportation, and are therefore unlikely options.
Answer:
bus station

Options: A) clear, B) unpredictable, C) important to farmers, D) hot or cold, E) mild,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weather can be difficult to predict, which implies that it may change frequently and without warning. This could be due to a variety of factors such as atmospheric conditions, geography, and climate patterns. The other options, such as "clear" or "hot or cold", do not add much insight into why the weather might be difficult to predict.
Answer:
unpredictable

Options: A) marriage, B) ignore, C) let down, D) aid, E) neglect,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person did not feel supported by others and was often disappointed by their actions. "Let down" means to disappoint someone by failing to provide them with the expected or needed support, which makes it the best choice among the given options. "Ignore" and "neglect" are similar in meaning, but they do not convey the sense of being let down by someone who was expected to provide support. "Marriage" and "aid" are not related to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
let down
Question: What happens when someone trips when going for run?
Options: A) falling down, B) sweating, C) get tired, D) flying, E) working out,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the subject tripped, which would likely result in them falling down.

Flying is not a plausible option at all, and working out is not an outcome of tripping.
Answer:
falling down

Options: A) space lab, B) a state college, C) school, D) nanotechnology, E) university,
Knowledge: Universities are widely regarded as institutions where higher education is provided, and as such, they usually offer courses in various disciplines, including science. While some of the other options, such as a state college or even a nanotechnology institution, may also offer courses in science, universities are generally associated with a broad range of academic fields. A space lab might suggest a place where scientific experiments are carried out in space, which is not what the question is asking. The option "school" is too general and does not provide any specific information.
Answer:
university

Options: A) porch, B) rocky areas, C) garden, D) shady spot, E) sunny place,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lizard was trying to warm itself up, which means it would need to be in a warm location. The term "sunny place" implies a location that receives direct sunlight, which is a source of warmth. The other options may not provide the warmth that the lizard needs, such as a shady spot or a porch, which may be cooler in temperature. Rocky areas and gardens are too general and do not provide any specific information related to the lizard's need for warmth.
Answer:
sunny place
Question: If a cottage is above the cloud line, where is it?
Options: A) village, B) rural area, C) mountains, D) fairy story, E) valley,

Options: A) overspending, B) standing in line, C) loss of money, D) run out of money, E) new shoes,
Knowledge: Sally's conflicting feelings about shopping suggest that she may have a fear or anxiety about spending money, which could explain why it is painful for her to buy things even though she loves getting what she wants. The phrase "loss of money" suggests that Sally may feel a sense of financial insecurity or stress when she spends money, which would be consistent with her mixed feelings about shopping. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence or the possible reasons why Sally might find shopping painful.
Answer:
loss of money

Options: A) bad dreams, B) lazyness, C) get pregnant, D) sleepiness, E) rest,
Knowledge: Going to bed is typically associated with the need for sleep, which is often characterized by feelings of sleepiness or tiredness. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Bad dreams may be a reason someone wakes up or has trouble falling asleep, but not necessarily a reason for going to bed. Laziness and getting pregnant are also not directly related to the act of going to bed. Rest could be a reason for someone to take a break or relax, but it is not necessarily a synonym for going to bed.

sleepiness

Options: A) toy store, B) shelf, C) mall, D) house, E) cupboard,
Knowledge: The question suggests that playing a board game with family is an activity typically done in a domestic setting, which is why the correct answer is "house." The other options do not fit the context of the question. A "toy store" and "shelf" are not places where one would typically play a board game, and a "mall" is a public space that is not typically associated with playing games. "Cupboard" is also not a suitable option, as it refers to a storage space, rather than a location for an activity.
Answer:
house

Feeling important or owning a house do not necessarily relate to confidence, while crying suggests the opposite of confidence, which is vulnerability or insecurity. Knowing what time also does not relate to confidence.
Answer:
trust himself

Guilty conscience, pleasure, and a fun day out are not appropriate responses because they do not relate to the legal consequences of killing. Retribution is a possible consequence of a criminal trial, but it is not the direct answer to the question being asked.
Answer:
criminal trial
Question: What is considered to be an outdated way to gain knowledge?
Options: A) encyclopedia, B) television, C) head, D) library, E) book,
Knowledge: Encyclopedias are reference books that contain information on various topics.

The other choices may still be valid sources of gaining knowledge, especially books and libraries, which are still widely used.
Answer:

Question: What was the hardest thing for her to do while learning to ski?
Options: A) slip on ice, B) fall down, C) fall over, D) sweat, E) maintain balance,
Knowledge: The question suggests that learning to ski was a challenging activity, and the answer options provide possible difficulties that the person might have encountered. The option "maintain balance" is the most likely answer, as skiing requires a significant amount of balance and coordination to stay upright on the slopes. The other options, such as slipping on ice or falling down, are common occurrences while learning to ski but are not the most challenging aspect of the activity. Sweat is not directly relevant to the question and is not a difficulty that would typically be associated with learning to ski.
Answer:
maintain balance
Question: What causes furniture to become a projectile?
Options: A) canon, B) baseball, C) battle field, D) war zone, E) tornado,
Knowledge: A tornado is a natural disaster that can cause high-speed winds and can pick up objects and hurl them through the air. Furniture can become a projectile in a tornado as it is lifted off the ground and carried by the wind. The other options (canon, baseball, battle field, war zone) do not provide any context that suggests how furniture could become a projectile.
Answer:
tornado
Question: What weapon will aim for the nose of an aircraft?
Options: A) upper respiratory tract, B) missile, C) boomerang, D) head, E) aircraft,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a weapon that has the specific capability of targeting the nose of an aircraft. This narrows down the choices to options that are weapons and can target a specific part of an aircraft. Out of these options, the only weapon that can specifically target a part of an aircraft is a missile. The other options are not weapons or do not have the capability of targeting a specific part of an aircraft.
Answer:
missile
Question: Spending too much time contemplating can lead to what kind of pain?
Options: A) relaxation, B) deciding, C) regret, D) revelations, E) headache,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spending too much time contemplating something can lead to a negative outcome, specifically a type of pain. The options "relaxation" and "deciding" do not fit with this negative connotation, and "regret" also doesn't make sense as a result of merely contemplating something. "Revelations" could potentially fit, but it is not typically associated with pain. The remaining option, "headache," is a well-known effect of prolonged mental strain or excessive thinking, making it the correct option.
Answer:
headache
Question: They burned the record, they were trying to do what to history?
Options: A) compact disc, B) tape, C) rewrite, D) play music, E) erase,
Knowledge: The verb "burned" suggests that they destroyed the record intentionally, and the phrase "trying to do what to history" implies that it was an attempt to alter or erase history. The other options -- compact disc, tape, rewrite, and play music -- do not fit the context of the sentence and are not activities that would be associated with altering history.
Answer:
erase
Question: After being in a hospital for weeks and breathing fresh air finally, what happened to the released patient?
Options: A) cheer, B) relaxation, C) feel better, D) silence, E) coughing,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the released patient had been in the hospital for a while and was feeling unwell. Breathing fresh air suggests that the patient was outside, which could have helped them feel better. The other options do not necessarily suggest an improvement in the patient's health or well-being.
Answer:
feel better
Question: Where is a dentist office likely to be?
Options: A) hospital, B) office building, C) shopping mall, D) street, E) minnesota,
Knowledge: Dentist offices are often located in office buildings, as these offer a professional atmosphere and convenient location for patients. Hospitals may have dental clinics, but they are typically located within the hospital complex and may not be accessible to the general public. Shopping malls and streets are also unlikely locations for a dental practice, as they do not offer the necessary privacy and infrastructure for medical procedures. The location of Minnesota is not relevant to the context of the question.
Answer:
office building
Question: The neolithic person was hungry, so what was their solution to the prblem?
Options: A) thank god, B) hunt for food, C) feel humiliated, D) sleep, E) prepare to go,
Knowledge: The sentence tells us that the neolithic person was hungry, which suggests that they needed to find a way to obtain food. Out of the given choices, "hunt for food" is the most logical solution to this problem. In prehistoric times, hunting and gathering were the primary ways of obtaining food, so it makes sense that this would be the neolithic person's solution. The other options do not provide a practical solution to the problem of hunger.
Answer:
hunt for food
Question: Where can just a few passengers ride?
Options: A) car, B) transportation, C) bus depot, D) vehicle, E) train station,
Knowledge: The phrase "just a few passengers" suggests a small vehicle, which points to the option of a car. Transportation and vehicle are general terms that can refer to any mode of transportation, and bus depot and train station both suggest larger modes of transportation that would accommodate more passengers. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a car.
Answer:
car
Question: how is a Christian likely to feel about their death?
Options: A) believe in jesus christ, B) forlorn, C) reconciled, D) go astray, E) live forever,
Knowledge: Christianity teaches that believers can be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus Christ, and that death is not the end, but a transition to eternal life with God. Therefore, a Christian is likely to feel reconciled, or at peace, about their death if they believe in Jesus Christ. The other options do not align with Christian beliefs about death.
Answer:
reconciled
Question: Where do you store your deodorant when not using it?
Options: A) medicine cabinet, B) spray, C) medicine chest, D) own bathroom, E) shower,
Knowledge: A medicine cabinet or medicine chest is typically where people store personal hygiene products such as deodorant, as well as other health and beauty items like toothbrushes, razors, and medications. The other options, such as using a spray or keeping it in the shower, do not make as much sense because they may decrease the shelf-life or effectiveness of the product. Keeping deodorant in one's own bathroom is plausible, but the most commonly associated storage location is the medicine cabinet or medicine chest.
Answer:
medicine cabinet
Question: She created music to share how she felt with another, what was her goal?
Options: A) express emotion, B) quiet mind, C) beautifull, D) boredom, E) irritate,
Knowledge: The sentence states that the person created music to share how they felt with another, which suggests that their goal was to convey their emotions through music. The option "express emotion" is the only one that aligns with this idea. The other options do not match the context of the sentence, for example, "quiet mind" and "beautiful" do not relate to creating music to share emotions. "Boredom" and "irritate" have a negative connotation, which seems unlikely to be the intended goal of the person creating the music.
Answer:
express emotion
Question: What is food that is able to be eaten?
Options: A) spoiled, B) necessary to live, C) edible, D) supermarket, E) unhealthy,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a term that describes food that can be consumed without causing harm or discomfort. The term "edible" specifically refers to food that is safe and suitable for consumption. The other options do not accurately describe food that is safe for consumption. "Spoiled" implies that the food is rotten or inedible, "necessary to live" describes a basic need that food fulfills, "supermarket" is a place where food is sold, but it doesn't indicate whether the food is safe to eat or not, and "unhealthy" describes the quality of the food, but again, not its edibility.
Answer:
edible
Question: When someone is pretending to cry they are?
Options: A) acting, B) yelling, C) got injured, D) hurt, E) miserable,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is not actually crying but pretending to do so. In this context, the term "act" means to pretend, and it is often used when referring to someone who is pretending to be a character or emotion that they are not actually feeling. Yelling, getting injured, being hurt, or being miserable are unrelated to the context of pretending to cry.
Answer:
acting
Question: The police saw the moving car, what did they know the suspect was doing?
Options: A) driving, B) breathing, C) getting tired, D) ticket, E) accidents,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the police witnessed a car that was in motion, indicating that the suspect was driving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
driving
Question: Where would you put your change if you plan to use it soon and you are not a man?
Options: A) wardrobe, B) jar, C) pocket, D) purse, E) backseat of car,
Knowledge: The question mentions that the person is not a man, which indicates that they likely carry a purse or some type of bag with them. The question also suggests that the change will be used soon, which means it needs to be easily accessible. Putting change in a wardrobe or backseat of a car would not be practical as it would be difficult to access when needed. A jar is not a common place to store change outside of a home or office, so the most practical option is to put the change in a purse.
Answer:
purse
Question: What is the worst part of playing games?
Options: A) learning, B) happiness, C) competition, D) losing, E) fatigue,
Knowledge: The question is asking about the negative aspect of playing games, and losing is a common frustration that many people experience when playing games. Learning may also be challenging, but it is not necessarily the "worst" part for everyone. Happiness and competition are positive aspects and do not fit the question's premise. Fatigue may be a physical challenge, but it is not necessarily the worst part of playing games for everyone.
Answer:
losing
Question: After work and errands the mother just wanted some peace and quiet, she couldn't wait to just get where?
Options: A) sea, B) library, C) driveway, D) top of mountain, E) home,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mother's desired destination is associated with peace and quiet. Home is a common place where people seek refuge and relaxation, making it the best fit for the context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
home
Question: What is the likelihood of drowning when getting wet?
Options: A) shrinking, B) feeling cold, C) become cold, D) cool off, E) could,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting wet could potentially lead to drowning, but it does not state it as a certain outcome. "Could" indicates possibility or probability, making it the most appropriate answer. The other options do not accurately reflect the meaning conveyed in the sentence.
Answer:
could
Question: If a person wants to get coffee without leaving their car, where might they stop?
Options: A) gas station, B) grocery store, C) friend's house, D) supermarket, E) fast food restaurant,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wants to get coffee without leaving their car, which is commonly offered at fast food restaurants through their drive-thru service. Gas stations and supermarkets may have coffee available for purchase, but they may not offer it in a way that allows the person to stay in their car. Grocery stores and friend's houses are unlikely places to stop for coffee if the person is looking for convenience.
Answer:
fast food restaurant
Question: If a storey contained many small restaurants, what type of structure would it be in?
Options: A) city hall, B) apartment building, C) mall, D) book of stories, E) tall building,
Knowledge: The sentence describes a storey (or level) that contains multiple small restaurants. This is a common feature of a mall, which often has multiple levels with a variety of stores and restaurants. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. City halls typically contain government offices, an apartment building usually contains residential units, and a book of stories is a literary work, not a physical structure. Tall building is too broad and does not provide enough information.
Answer:
mall
Question: What is a synonym for faith?
Options: A) trust, B) move mountains, C) uplift, D) belief, E) experience,
Knowledge: A synonym is a word that has a similar meaning to another word. In this case, the word "faith" means a strong belief in something, often without proof or evidence. The word "belief" also means a strong conviction or acceptance that something is true or real, and is therefore a good synonym for "faith." The other options do not have the same meaning as "faith" or are expressions that are used in a different context.
Answer:
belief
Question: What type of plant is the tallest found on earth?
Options: A) tree, B) orbit, C) pressure, D) space, E) solar system,
Knowledge: The sentence is referring to the tallest plant found on Earth, and trees are the most common type of plant that can grow to great heights. Other options like orbit, pressure, space, and solar system are not related to the context of the question and are therefore incorrect.
Answer:
tree
Question: Why does a person stay in bed on the weekend?
Options: A) slumber, B) bedsores, C) lay down, D) sleep in, E) falling asleep,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is staying in bed during the weekend, which is often associated with taking advantage of the opportunity to sleep longer than usual. "Sleep in" refers to sleeping later than one normally would, and is a common reason why people may stay in bed on the weekend. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
sleep in

Rest areas typically have amenities such as restrooms, picnic tables, and benches for travelers to use while taking a break from the road. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.

Question: James is eloquent, usually.  Today he was just doing what to himself?
Options: A) speechless, B) voiceless, C) screaming, D) stumbling, E) muttering,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that James is typically good at expressing himself, but on this particular occasion, he was struggling to communicate. The word "eloquent" suggests that James has a way with words, while "muttering" implies that he was struggling to articulate his thoughts. The other options (speechless, voiceless, screaming, stumbling) do not fit the context of the sentence because they do not describe someone who is trying to speak but having difficulty doing so.
Answer:
muttering
Question: What might I use to grow a ficus on my patio?
Options: A) tropical forest, B) arboretum, C) soil, D) pots, E) large pot,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a way to grow a ficus on their patio. The options "tropical forest" and "arboretum" refer to natural environments and do not provide any guidance on how to grow a plant in a specific location. "Soil" is important for growing plants, but it is not a suitable answer for this question because the speaker is looking for a container to grow the ficus in. "Large pot" is a more specific answer than "pots" and may be correct in some cases, but the size of the pot depends on the size of the plant and the space available on the patio. Therefore, the best answer is "pots," which suggests that the speaker should consider using multiple containers to grow the ficus on their patio.
Answer:
pots
Question: Where would you not be able to find a diaphragm if there is no one in it?
Options: A) drugstore, B) human, C) woman's body, D) human body, E) valve,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the word "diaphragm" refers to a form of birth control that is designed to be inserted into a woman's body. Therefore, the answer must be a location where a diaphragm would not be found if there is no one to insert it. A drugstore sells various forms of birth control, so it is not a viable option. The other options are all related to the human body, which is where a diaphragm would be found.
Answer:
drugstore
Question: What businesses  serve liquor?
Options: A) bar, B) cabinet, C) fraternity house, D) soft drink, E) state farm,
Knowledge: Bars are establishments that serve alcoholic beverages, making them the most logical choice for businesses that serve liquor. Fraternity houses may serve beer or other beverages, but they are not typically licensed to serve liquor. Cabinets are furniture pieces, and State Farm is an insurance company. Soft drinks do not contain alcoholic content, so they cannot be considered as businesses that serve liquor.
Answer:
bar
Question: The house wasn't connected to anything but rather was randomly plopped down in the woods, what did it need to have visitors?
Options: A) city, B) residential area, C) milk man, D) street, E) subdivision,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the house is located in a remote area and not connected to any other buildings or infrastructure, which means that it would need a street to allow visitors to access it. A street provides a pathway and connection to other areas, which is necessary for visitors to reach the house. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as a city, residential area, subdivision, or milk man would not necessarily help visitors access the house.
Answer:
street
Question: The world is very big, it has many countries and continents on it's spherical surface.  There are many types of people It's very what?
Options: A) complicated, B) round, C) square, D) diverse, E) large,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the world is home to many different types of people and places, which points to the idea of diversity. Additionally, the use of the word "big" implies that the world is extensive and encompasses a lot of different things, another aspect of diversity. The other options, such as "complicated" or "square," do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
Answer:
diverse

The general store was a common fixture of towns during this time period, which sold a variety of goods including these items. The other options, such as a shopping mall or meat store, do not fit the context of the question and are not associated with the Old West.
Answer:
old west
Question: If you spend time doing what you will need a rest?
Options: A) pay debts, B) wakefulness, C) resthold, D) active, E) in motion,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that engaging in a certain activity will cause the individual to need a rest. Being active, or engaging in physical activity, is a common cause of fatigue and the need for rest. Paying debts and wakefulness do not necessarily require physical exertion, while resthold and in motion are not commonly used terms and do not provide clear context to the sentence.
Answer:
active
Question: As the company was concerned about profit, what were they looking to cut?
Options: A) losses, B) expense, C) losing money, D) lose money, E) eat cake,
Knowledge: The sentence makes it clear that the company was concerned about profit, which suggests they were looking to cut something that was costing them money. Expenses are costs associated with running a business, so it makes sense that they would be the target of the cost-cutting measures. "Losses", "losing money", and "lose money" all refer to the same thing and could be considered redundant answers. "Eat cake" is a nonsensical option that does not relate to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
expense
Question: What in the building is very far from the ground floor?
Options: A) basement, B) air, C) ceiling, D) water, E) sky,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something in the building is located at a significant height from the ground floor. This would usually be the ceiling of the building, which is above all the floors and can be very far from the ground level. The other options do not make sense in this context - the basement is usually below the ground floor, air and water do not have a specific height, and the sky is outside the building.
Answer:
ceiling
Question: If you saw a fish break the surface of the water and flap its fins in the air, you might think it is doing what?
Options: A) school together, B) pets, C) attempt to fly, D) find food, E) hatred,
Knowledge: Fish are not capable of flying, and it is unlikely that they would intentionally flap their fins in the air unless they were attempting to jump or escape from a predator. This suggests that the correct answer is "attempt to fly." The other options, such as "school together" or "hatred," do not make sense in the context of a fish flapping its fins in the air.
Answer:
attempt to fly
Question: His boss told him that he would be speaking to the group that afternoon, he needed him to share his knowledge at the next what?
Options: A) university, B) class, C) office party, D) book, E) meeting,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the boss asked the person to speak to a group that same afternoon. The word "meeting" is the only choice that fits this context, as all the others imply a different audience or setting. A "university" or "class" would suggest a more formal or educational environment, while an "office party" or "book" would imply a more casual or festive atmosphere. Therefore, "meeting" is the most fitting answer.
Answer:
meeting
Question: The tool was stored in what part of the house with the car?
Options: A) basement, B) garage, C) hardware store, D) living room, E) repair shop,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tool is related to a car since it is stored in the same place as the car. The most logical option would be the garage, which is where cars are typically stored. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
garage
Question: Exercising by lifting weights will give you large what?
Options: A) breaths, B) shortness of breath, C) muscles, D) effort, E) discipline,
Knowledge: Lifting weights is a common exercise for building muscle. Muscles are the primary focus of weightlifting, and in order to gain muscle mass, one must consistently lift weights and challenge their body. The other answer choices do not make sense in the context of lifting weights; breaths and shortness of breath are related to cardio exercises, effort is required in any exercise, and discipline is a personal trait that can be applied to any activity.
Answer:
muscles
Question: What happens when glass has been hit?
Options: A) melted, B) break easily, C) shattering, D) hold water, E) many different colors,
Knowledge: The word "hit" suggests forceful impact, which would cause glass to shatter rather than melt. Glass that has been hit is likely to have sharp, jagged edges and not easily hold water. While glass can come in many different colors, this information is not relevant to the context of the question.
Answer:
shattering
Question: What can cause someone to want to go somewhere else because it's so smelly?
Options: A) rose bush, B) go back, C) die, D) arrive there, E) fart,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a bad smell is causing someone to want to leave and the word "fart" specifically refers to a bodily function that can produce an unpleasant odor. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A rose bush, for example, is unlikely to emit a strong odor that would make someone want to leave, and "go back," "die," and "arrive there" are not related to the topic of bad smells.
Answer:
fart
Question: What is the result of more people getting in line?
Options: A) anxiety, B) wait turn, C) late, D) longer lines, E) have to wait for,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a line and the more people who join the line, the result is (blank). Longer lines make sense in this context because a greater number of people would mean that the line would become longer. The other options do not make as much sense in this context.
Answer:
longer lines
Question: They really needed the information prisoner, so they did the least human thing and began to what the prisoner?
Options: A) better himself, B) think and reason, C) have fever, D) hurt, E) torture,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the interrogators resorted to extreme measures to get the information they needed from the prisoner. The phrase "least human thing" implies that the action was cruel and inhumane, which rules out options like "better himself" and "think and reason". "Have fever" does not make sense in this context, leaving "hurt" and "torture" as the only plausible options. However, since the sentence specifies that they "began to", it is more likely that the correct answer is "torture" as this suggests a prolonged and intentional action rather than a one-time act of violence.
Answer:
torture
Question: James found himself watching films all the time.  He did it because he was too high strung and needed some what?
Options: A) like, B) stupidity, C) relaxation, D) enjoyment, E) loved,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James watches films as a way to alleviate his high-strung state. This implies that he may be looking for a way to unwind and relax, making "relaxation" the most appropriate answer. The other options do not accurately reflect James' motivation for watching films.
Answer:
relaxation

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jim made a mistake while driving which caused him to hit a car. The clue to identifying the correct answer is that Jim mistook forward for something else, indicating that he may have been in the wrong gear. Reverse is the option that makes the most sense in this context as it is the opposite of forward and commonly used when driving a car in the opposite direction. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
reverse

Answer:

Question: James thought that the desk was built with solidity, but when he rapped on it he could hear what?
Options: A) openness, B) instability, C) hollowness, D) strange sounds, E) weakness,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that James believed the desk was well-built and sturdy, but when he rapped on it, he could hear something that contradicts this.

Answer:
hollowness

Options: A) murky, B) confusing, C) invisible, D) misunderstood, E) teacher,

Options: A) unfinished, B) bumpy, C) done, D) partial, E) ended,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the mayor wanted the road to be "complete," suggesting that it was still under construction or not yet fully built. The adjective "frustrated" further implies that there were obstacles or difficulties preventing the completion of the road, which could be indicative of it being unfinished. The other options do not accurately convey the sense of incompleteness or frustration suggested in the sentence.
Answer:
unfinished

Answer:

Options: A) toy store, B) casino, C) table, D) table play, E) deck,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the focus is on betting on cards in various games, which would typically occur in a gambling setting such as a casino. A toy store is unlikely to have gambling-related items, while the terms "table" and "table play" are too vague to indicate a specific location. "Deck" is also too general and could refer to any location where cards are sold or used.
Answer:
casino

The other options, like field or buy fresh vegetables, do not necessarily suggest the presence of an open air market.
Answer:
village

"Stand upright" is a physical posture that is generally seen as healthy and desirable. "Donate to charity" is an act of philanthropy that is typically viewed positively.

Options: A) drawer, B) vagina, C) arm, D) health center, E) medicine cabinet,
Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that a condom is specifically designed for use on a penis as a form of contraceptive. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the answer choice for diaphragm should also refer to a body part related to contraception. The vagina is a common site for contraceptive devices and is often associated with the use of a diaphragm. The other options are not related to contraception or reproductive health.
Answer:
vagina

Knowledge: The phrase "morning pill" suggests that the pill is part of a daily medication routine, which is often stored in a designated place like a medicine cabinet.

Question: Where is plumbing likely to be clogged by food?
Options: A) bathroom, B) wall, C) kitchen, D) oil refineries, E) water park,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that food is the likely culprit for clogging plumbing in a specific location.

However, kitchens are where food is prepared and disposed of, which makes it likely that food could accidentally get into the plumbing and cause a clog.
Answer:
kitchen

The phrase "in addition to making you sick" implies that there are other negative effects that result from drinking alcohol.

The other options do not make logical sense as potential consequences of drinking alcohol.

Options: A) own kitchen, B) empty restaurant, C) table setting, D) kitchen cupboard, E) cruet,
Knowledge: A saltshaker is a commonly used item in the kitchen, specifically for seasoning food. When it's not in use, it's typically stored in a convenient location within the kitchen, such as a cupboard or on a countertop. The other options are less likely to be the correct answer because an empty restaurant or table setting would not be the appropriate place to store a personal item like a saltshaker, and a cruet is a separate item used for storing and pouring liquids, not dry seasonings like salt.
Answer:
kitchen cupboard
Question: Where might a soldier be honored?
Options: A) war zone, B) white house, C) guns, D) battlefield, E) tent,
Knowledge: Soldiers may be honored in various ways, but being honored at the White House is a commonly known tradition in the United States.

Options: A) informative, B) dead, C) legal, D) entertaining, E) obsolete,
Knowledge: The question is asking about a reason to pay your television bill, which implies that not paying the bill may have legal consequences. Therefore, the correct answer is "legal."

Question: What is likely to be the result of instituting civil action?
Options: A) go to jail, B) restitution, C) illness, D) riot, E) trial,

Answer:
restitution
Question: Where would you go if you only wanted to buy clothes?
Options: A) house, B) clothing store, C) toy store, D) mall, E) bedroom,
Knowledge: The word "clothes" in the question indicates that the answer should be a place where one can buy clothing. A "house" is a place where someone lives and is unlikely to sell clothes. Similarly, a "bedroom" is a room in a house and not a place to buy clothes. A "toy store" sells toys and not clothes. A "mall" is a large shopping center that typically has many stores, including clothing stores, making it a possible answer. However, "clothing store" is the most specific and accurate answer as it directly refers to a store that specializes in selling clothes.
Answer:
clothing store

Options: A) freedom, B) tears, C) richer, D) depression, E) tissues,
Knowledge: When people get divorced, it is common for them to experience emotional distress such as grief, sadness, or anger. This can lead to a lot of crying and the need for tissues. The other options don't have a clear connection to divorce. Freedom might be a positive outcome of a divorce, but it's not something someone "produces". Richer is unlikely, as divorce often involves dividing assets. Depression may be a consequence of divorce, but it's not something someone "produces".
Answer:
tears
Question: Boredom led him to go out to the bar, there were many characters there and he what?
Options: A) meet interesting people, B) play games, C) field, D) skateboard, E) listen to music,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person went to the bar to alleviate their boredom and found many characters there. Meeting interesting people is a common reason for going out to social places like bars. Playing games, skateboarding, and listening to music are activities that may not be common in bars, and the word "field" has no clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
meet interesting people

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there was a change in the scientists' initial belief due to new evidence. The word "impossibility" indicates that the scientists initially believed something could not happen. However, the phrase "new evidence" implies that their belief changed. The word "possibility" is the most likely choice as it indicates that there is now some chance that the previously deemed impossible event may occur. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not signify a change in the scientists' belief.
Answer:
possibility
Question: Every one of the kids felt average, but the teacher explained that each one was what?
Options: A) uncommon, B) an adult, C) bad, D) special, E) hyperbolic,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the kids had low self-esteem and did not believe they were exceptional in any way. However, the teacher's statement contradicts this and implies that each child has unique qualities that make them special. The word "special" is commonly used in this context to encourage and motivate children. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer.
Answer:
special

Answer:
water

Options: A) in jail, B) homes, C) hotel, D) furniture store, E) hallway,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was in a temporary lodging, specifically a hotel room, where he placed an unfamiliar item on the night table. The other options do not make sense in this context. He is unlikely to be in jail or a furniture store, while hallway and even homes do not provide enough information to be definitive.
Answer:
hotel

Options: A) bookstore, B) pharmacy, C) supermarket, D) fast food restaurant, E) shop,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James's workplace has new releases and bestsellers, which are typically associated with bookstores. Additionally, the fact that James has leisure time to browse these titles suggests that he works in a relatively quiet environment, which is also a common characteristic of bookstores. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
bookstore
Question: What would someone be if he or she killed the biggest amount of people?
Options: A) effusive, B) enabled, C) accidental, D) asomatous, E) detestable,

The word "detestable" means deserving intense dislike or hatred, which is an appropriate term for describing someone who has committed such a heinous act. The other options do not have any clear relation to the context of the question.
Answer:
detestable
Question: James searched his hotel for the return ticket.  He needed to find it before he left for where?
Options: A) home, B) tickets, C) pocket, D) plane, E) airport,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James needs to find his return ticket before he leaves for his next destination. The options "home," "tickets," and "pocket" do not make sense in this context because James is already at the hotel and is clearly searching for something specific. "Plane" could be a possible answer, but the sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that James needs to find his ticket before boarding the plane. "Airport" makes the most sense because it is the most likely place for James to leave from to return to his destination.
Answer:
airport
Question: cats have how many apendages?
Options: A) tail, B) whiskers, C) two eyes, D) four paws, E) four legs,
Knowledge: Cats are known to have four legs, which are used for walking, running, jumping, and other forms of movement. While they also have other appendages such as tails and whiskers, these are not considered limbs or legs. Eyes are sensory organs, not limbs, and cats typically have two of them. Paws are the fleshy parts at the end of the legs that provide support and traction, but they are not separate appendages in themselves. Therefore, the correct answer is four legs.
Answer:
four legs
Question: What do you need to make sure that you are at night while driving?
Options: A) car, B) vehicle, C) distraction, D) being awake, E) napping,

Being awake and alert while driving is crucial to ensuring safety on the road, especially at night when visibility may be reduced. The other options, such as having a car or vehicle, are necessary to drive, but do not directly relate to driving safely at night. Distractions and napping are potential hazards to safe driving, and should be avoided while driving.
Answer:
being awake

Options: A) calligrapher's hand, B) shirt pocket, C) desk drawer, D) portfolio, E) blotter,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needed to sign some papers and retrieved their fountain pen from a specific location. The options "calligrapher's hand," "shirt pocket," and "portfolio" do not make sense in the context of retrieving a pen. "Blotter" is not a location where someone would typically store a pen. This leaves "desk drawer" as the most likely option, as it is a common place to keep writing instruments.
Answer:
desk drawer
Question: How do most people feel about a person they love?
Options: A) popularity, B) know all, C) own house, D) care about, E) flu,

Options: A) people helped, B) learning new skills, C) better circumstances, D) practice, E) happiness,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sarah went to school to become a nurse, which suggests that she has already acquired some skills in providing assistance to people. However, to better help people, the sentence implies that Sarah needs to continually improve her skills by learning new ones. The other options do not match the context of the sentence – "people helped" and "better circumstances" suggest outcomes rather than specific actions, "practice" may relate to skill-building but lacks the implication of seeking out new knowledge, and "happiness" is not clearly connected to the idea of providing assistance.
Answer:
learning new skills
Question: The man is drunk and angry, what does he look to do to others?
Options: A) appear ridiculous, B) fight, C) throw up, D) raise hell, E) walk off,
Knowledge: The phrase "raise hell" typically refers to someone causing a disturbance or creating chaos, which would be in line with someone who is drunk and angry. The other options don't fit the context as well - appearing ridiculous, throwing up, and walking off may be potential consequences of being drunk, but they don't necessarily involve the person taking action against others. Fighting could be a possibility, but "raise hell" is a more appropriate phrase to use in this context.
Answer:
raise hell
Question: Joe was running around his home and crossed a property boundary, running into a meticulously manicured rosebush and doing damage to both it and himself.  Where might the rosebush been located?
Options: A) neighbor's yard, B) in the ground, C) field, D) nature, E) botanic garden,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Joe crossed a property boundary, which implies that he left his own property and entered someone else's. If he ran into a rosebush, it is likely that the bush was located in the neighbor's yard, which is a common place to find plants and landscaping. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
neighbor's yard

Canada also uses the bald eagle as a symbol, but it is not as commonly associated with that country as it is with the U.S.
Answer:
u.s
Question: What divider is often between two buildings that cars drive on?
Options: A) fork in road, B) sidewalk, C) living room, D) street, E) binder,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a physical divider between two buildings that cars drive on. Sidewalks are typically located next to buildings and are not meant for cars, while a fork in the road would generally lead to different directions rather than dividing two buildings. A living room and binder are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is street.
Answer:
street
Question: Many people gather together on Sundays, they tend to believe that earth is what?
Options: A) one moon, B) flat, C) god's creation, D) milky way, E) universe,

Answer:
god's creation

Options: A) addidas, B) north america, C) cafe, D) outside, E) woodland,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy wants to have a picnic outside because he doesn't want to buy food from a restaurant. The option "addidas" is a brand of clothing and not related to the context of the sentence. "North America" is a continent and not a location suitable for a picnic. "Cafe" implies buying food from a restaurant, which Billy doesn't want to do. "Woodland" would not be a suitable location for Billy because he is allergic to trees and hates them. Therefore, the correct answer is "outside."
Answer:
outside
Question: Driving to work late is never pleasant, but you still shouldn't what?
Options: A) listen to radio, B) sing, C) speed, D) anger, E) statue,

Options: A) cruise ship, B) coming together, C) restaurant, D) mall, E) home,
Knowledge: Cruise ships are known for providing luxury experiences for their passengers, with extravagant dining areas being a common feature. The limited space on a ship also means that every area needs to be utilized to the fullest, with dining areas often taking up a significant portion of the ship's interior. In contrast, a home or restaurant may have limited space and resources for extravagant dining areas, while a mall or "coming together" are not typically associated with dining areas at all.
Answer:
cruise ship

Knowledge: The Milky Way is a term used to describe the galaxy in which our solar system resides. It is a vast, disc-shaped structure that contains billions of stars, dust, and gas.

Options: A) beak, B) ability to fly, C) feet, D) wings, E) learn to fly,
Knowledge: Birds are known for having wings, which they use to fly. The sentence mentions that birds do not have arms, which is a characteristic that distinguishes them from mammals.

Answer:

Question: Why would a person go to school?
Options: A) party, B) own house, C) more leisure time, D) successful in life, E) not feel pain,
Knowledge: Going to school is often associated with obtaining an education or training that can lead to greater opportunities and success in life. While some individuals may go to school for socializing purposes, such as partying, the primary motivation for attending school is to gain knowledge and skills that can help one achieve their personal and professional goals. The other options, such as owning a house, having more leisure time, or not feeling pain, are not relevant factors in the decision to attend school.
Answer:
successful in life
Question: What does your body do when walking?
Options: A) exercise, B) move, C) getting somewhere, D) moving forward, E) keep moving forward,
Knowledge: The verb "walking" implies movement, so the correct answer should also relate to movement. "Exercise" is too broad and does not specifically describe what the body does while walking. "Getting somewhere" and "moving forward" are both correct, but "move" is the most general and accurate answer that encompasses all types of walking. "Keep moving forward" implies a specific direction, which is not necessarily true for all walks.
Answer:
move
Question: What could happen to a car when you press one of its pedals?
Options: A) gain speed, B) go forward, C) rush away, D) go fast, E) suffer damage,
Knowledge: Pressing a pedal in a car typically controls some aspect of the car's movement. In this case, the options "go forward," "rush away," and "go fast" all generally mean the same thing as "gain speed," but are less specific. "Suffer damage" does not accurately describe the effect of pressing a pedal, and is therefore not a correct answer.
Answer:
gain speed
Question: The man owned a lot of guns, he thought more gun control was what?
Options: A) controlled in canada, B) a great idea, C) bad, D) semiautomatic, E) very dangerous,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man who owned a lot of guns did not agree with the idea of more gun control. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be an option that is the opposite of "a great idea" or "controlled in Canada," which suggests gun control is a positive thing. The option "semiautomatic" refers to a type of gun and is not related to the man's opinion. The option "very dangerous" also does not fit the sentence because it describes the guns, not the man's opinion.
Answer:
bad
Question: John was an important person, but when wronged he could be what?
Options: A) trivial, B) petty, C) slight, D) negligible, E) impoite,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John had an important role or position, but when he was wronged, he could exhibit a negative trait. The word "petty" means to focus on small or insignificant details, which suggests that John may become irrationally fixated on minor wrongs or grievances. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not describe negative traits that John might exhibit when wronged.
Answer:
petty
Question: The park had a refuse and littering problem, so they added another what?
Options: A) tip, B) park officer, C) incinerator, D) dump, E) wastebasket,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the park was facing a problem with people leaving trash and litter around, and that they took measures to address this issue. The most logical solution would be to add more garbage cans or wastebaskets to the park, which would make it easier for visitors to dispose of their trash properly. The other options, such as a tip or incinerator, do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence. A park officer could help enforce littering rules, but they would not directly address the problem of trash disposal.
Answer:
wastebasket
Question: When someone talk, what does someone else usually do to the person talking?
Options: A) don't interrupt, B) sit silently, C) keep silent, D) be silent, E) listening,
Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the focus is on what someone else does when someone is talking to them. The verb "talk" refers to speaking out loud, and the other options all suggest being silent or not interrupting, which is not specific enough to address the question. "Listening" is the best answer as it directly correlates to the act of someone speaking and someone else paying attention to what they are saying.
Answer:
listening
Question: What type of area would you be entering if dressed in a suit when putting your car in a parking lot?
Options: A) urban area, B) amusement park, C) house, D) business district, E) shopping center,
Knowledge: The phrase "dressed in a suit" suggests a formal attire typically worn for business or professional settings. Therefore, the most likely option is a business district, which is an area with many office buildings and commercial activities. The other options do not necessarily require formal attire, and would not necessarily warrant wearing a suit to park your car.
Answer:
business district
Question: What is a good place for a potato to mix with other veggies?
Options: A) beef stew, B) restaurants, C) garden, D) steak house, E) cooking pot,

The combination of potatoes and beef creates a hearty and filling meal, and the potatoes absorb the flavors of the other vegetables and spices in the stew. Restaurants, steak houses and gardens do not provide any specific context related to mixing potatoes with other veggies, while cooking pot is a generic term that does not suggest any particular dish or recipe.
Answer:
beef stew
Question: What can you do before taking final exams to help with them?
Options: A) study, B) sweat, C) graduation, D) cheat, E) sleep,
Knowledge: Final exams are typically associated with the need to prepare and review material beforehand. Studying is the most common way to do this, and is widely known as the most effective way to improve test results. Sweating is not likely to help with exams, and cheating is unethical and can lead to serious consequences. Graduation is a separate event that occurs after exams are taken, and sleeping may be helpful in some cases but is not a guaranteed way to improve exam performance.
Answer:
study

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when someone is deeply involved while watching a film, it means that the film is engaging and captivating. The word "deeply involved" implies that the person is emotionally invested in the story, which would only happen if the film is interesting. The other options do not necessarily suggest an emotional connection with the film or a high level of engagement.
Answer:
interesting

Options: A) small, B) horrible, C) awful, D) little, E) terrible,
Knowledge: The adjective "little" is often used to describe a younger sibling, indicating that the speaker had a good time with their younger brother. The other adjectives have negative connotations and would not be used to describe a positive experience, making "little" the most likely answer.
Answer:
little

Options: A) side with, B) hang out, C) go to the movies, D) understand each other, E) talking about,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the activity being done while relaxing with friends involves having a conversation or discussion, which is most closely associated with the option "talking about."

Options: A) have fun, B) indigestion, C) death, D) tasty, E) gas,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that people are eating a hamburger with friends, which typically implies a social activity. Eating with friends is often associated with having a good time and enjoying each other's company, which is why "having fun" is the correct answer. The other options, such as "indigestion," "death," "tasty," and "gas," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be correct.
Answer:
have fun
Question: Humans often have hunting instincts, so what do they do?
Options: A) excrete, B) cry, C) play piano, D) make mistakes, E) eat meat,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that humans have a natural inclination to hunt, which is typically done for food. Eating meat is a common practice for humans and is also supported by our teeth and digestive system. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: Why would someone visit many stores before buying products?
Options: A) online shopping, B) running out of money, C) debt, D) comparison shopping, E) overstocking,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is visiting multiple stores with the intention of buying products. However, the reason for doing so is not immediately clear. Among the options provided, only comparison shopping would make sense in this context. Comparison shopping involves visiting multiple stores to compare prices, features, and quality of products in order to make an informed decision about what to buy. The other options (online shopping, running out of money, debt, overstocking) do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence.
Answer:
comparison shopping
Question: What entity would have a fire extinguisher in their boardroom?
Options: A) boat, B) apartment, C) public building, D) most businesses, E) chemistry lab,
Knowledge: Fire extinguishers are typically found in buildings and spaces where a fire could occur, and most businesses are required by law to have them on hand. Boat and apartment may have fire extinguishers on board/in units, but it is unlikely for them to have one in their boardrooms specifically. Public buildings may have them, but not all of them do, and it is less common for them to have one in a boardroom. A chemistry lab would likely have a fire extinguisher as well, but again, it is less likely to be in their boardroom specifically.
Answer:
most businesses
Question: What is someone likely to do to someone accused of killing people they love?
Options: A) go home, B) sadness, C) retaliation, D) remorse, E) going to jail,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone has been accused of killing people that another person loves, which suggests that the person who loves the victims may seek revenge or retaliation against the accused. Retaliation is a common reaction to betrayal or harm, especially if the person feels a strong emotional connection to the victims. "Go home", "sadness", "remorse", and "going to jail" are not logical choices for a person's reaction to someone accused of killing their loved ones.
Answer:
retaliation
Question: A person doesn't have pants that fit, what should he do?

Question: Horses are big animals that get a lot of exercise.  Because he this, they need to do what?
Options: A) run quickly, B) pull wagon, C) go away, D) drink water, E) eat carrots,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that horses require a lot of energy to function properly due to their size and amount of exercise they get. As a result, they need to hydrate themselves properly by drinking water. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence as running quickly or pulling a wagon are forms of exercise that horses are already getting, going away is not a solution or a requirement, and eating carrots does not address the issue of hydration.
Answer:
drink water
Question: Where would you find a sloth that is not afraid of being hunted?
Options: A) forest canopy, B) nature preserve, C) zoo, D) tropical rainforest, E) commercial,
Knowledge: The question implies that sloths are commonly hunted, so the answer that makes sense is a location where hunting is prohibited or at least discouraged. A nature preserve is a protected area where animals can live without human interference, so it is the most likely option. A forest canopy and a tropical rainforest are both habitats where sloths live, but they do not provide protection from hunting. A zoo is a controlled environment where animals are kept in captivity, so it does not fit the description of a sloth that is not afraid of being hunted. "Commercial" is not a location where sloths would naturally live.
Answer:
nature preserve
Question: What is the biggest group of people on the east coast where you will find skyscrapers?
Options: A) new york city, B) big city, C) large city, D) metropolis, E) beach,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a group of people on the east coast where there are many skyscrapers. The term "skyscraper" is commonly associated with New York City, as it has the largest number of skyscrapers in the United States. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
new york city

Options: A) theater, B) theatre, C) stage show, D) photography studio, E) mini project,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the students were involved in some kind of performance, as they were building a backdrop for it. Both "theater" and "stage show" are viable options, but "theater" is spelled differently in British English ("theatre"). "Photography studio" and "mini project" do not make sense in the context of building a backdrop for a performance.
Answer:
stage show
Question: What is a convenient way for a farmer to preserve their crops?
Options: A) can produce, B) harvestation, C) water plants, D) produce food, E) rise early,
Knowledge: Canning is a common method of preserving crops for long periods of time. It involves sealing food in an airtight container, like a can, and then heating the can to destroy any bacteria or microorganisms that might cause spoilage. This process is commonly used for fruits and vegetables, and is a convenient way for farmers to extend the shelf life of their crops. The other options do not involve preserving crops in any way.
Answer:
can produce

Options: A) large office, B) at hotel, C) building, D) real estate office, E) store room,
Knowledge: The context suggests that John is trying to make a sale, and he is talking to someone who can help him with that. The fact that he is willing to lower the price also suggests that he is involved in real estate sales, where price negotiations are common. The other options do not make sense in the given context.
Answer:
real estate office
Question: The journalist had a simple approach, see story; do what?
Options: A) sit down, B) would read, C) reading, D) remember, E) write down,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the journalist had a straightforward approach to their work, and the phrase "see story" implies that they were able to quickly identify the key elements of a story. The phrase "write down" suggests that the journalist would take notes or record their observations in order to write their story later. The other options (sit down, would read, reading, remember) do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
Answer:
write down
Question: The stove had to be moved so the kitchen could be remodeled, where did it go?
Options: A) apartment, B) living room, C) boiling liquids like water, D) friend's house, E) restroom,
Knowledge: The sentence states that the stove had to be moved due to a kitchen remodel, which implies that the stove was temporarily relocated within the same living space. The most likely option from the given choices is the living room, as it is usually the largest open area in a home where a stove could be placed. The other options, such as apartment, friend's house, and restroom, do not fit the context of the sentence since they are not within the same living space. The option of boiling liquids like water is also unrelated since it does not provide a clear answer to where the stove was moved to.
Answer:
living room

Options: A) appear better, B) visit doctor, C) will to survive, D) take pills, E) pay bill,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the patient resisted doing something that nurses prompted him to do due to his financial situation.

The other options do not have a clear connection to being a poor patient or being prompted by nurses.
Answer:
take pills

Options: A) park, B) disneyland, C) churro stand, D) bowling alley, E) sporting event,

These events often have concession stands selling hot dogs and other snacks for attendees to enjoy while watching the game. While hot dogs may be sold in some of the other places listed, such as a park or a theme park like Disneyland, they are not typically associated with those locations as strongly as they are with sporting events.
Answer:
sporting event
Question: The husband never worked a day, but after getting divorced received alimony, what did he become as a result?
Options: A) emotional distress, B) bad feelings, C) richer, D) depression, E) guilty,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the husband received money (alimony) after the divorce. Since he never worked, it can be inferred that the money he received would make him "richer." The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
richer
Question: WHere do you typically buy prescription suntan lotion?
Options: A) beach bag, B) grocery store, C) pharmacy, D) shop, E) tanning salon,
Knowledge: Prescription suntan lotion is typically only available through a pharmacy, as it requires a prescription from a doctor. The other options, such as a grocery store or tanning salon, do not typically carry prescription medications. The beach bag and shop options are also unlikely, as they do not refer to a specific type of store or retailer.
Answer:
pharmacy
Question: If you like your jeans already broken in where should you shop?
Options: A) thrift store, B) clothing store, C) outside, D) closet, E) gap,
Knowledge: The phrase "broken in" suggests that the person wants jeans that have already been worn and have a more comfortable, relaxed fit. Thrift stores are known for selling secondhand clothing, including items that may have already been broken in by their previous owners. Clothing stores may sell new, stiff jeans that have not yet been worn in, and the options of outside and closet don't make sense in the context of the question. Gap is a specific clothing store, but it does not necessarily specialize in selling pre-worn or broken-in clothing.
Answer:
thrift store
Question: Where would you put a ficus if you do not want it to damage your floor?
Options: A) dictionary, B) middle east, C) earth, D) container, E) tropical forest,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ficus can potentially damage the floor, which indicates that it is a living plant. The correct answer would be a container, as this is a common way to pot plants in order to protect surfaces from damage. The other options do not have any connection with the context of the sentence: a dictionary is a book, the Middle East is a region, Earth is the planet we inhabit, and a tropical forest is a type of ecosystem.
Answer:
container
Question: The demand from people was high, how can chaos be avoided?
Options: A) bank money, B) call police, C) wait in line, D) believe in god, E) suffer pain,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that waiting in line may be a solution to avoiding chaos when demand is high. This is because waiting in line creates a structured and orderly way for people to access what they need without pushing or fighting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
wait in line
Question: Why would you be getting in shape?
Options: A) good health, B) jogging, C) exercise, D) sweat, E) feel better,
Knowledge: The question asks for the reason why someone would be getting in shape, and the answer that best fits this goal is good health. Regular exercise and physical activity are essential to maintaining good health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. While jogging, exercise, sweat, and feeling better may all be associated with getting in shape, none of them explicitly address the underlying motivation for doing so.
Answer:
good health
Question: What does someone committing suicide want to do?
Options: A) cut wrist, B) swimming, C) dying, D) die, E) interruption,
Knowledge: Suicide is an intentional act of taking one's own life. Therefore, the most appropriate option would be "die" as it accurately describes the intention of the person committing suicide. The other options do not match the context of the question and may even be considered insensitive or inappropriate. Cutting one's wrist is a form of self-harm, and swimming or interruption do not relate to suicide.
Answer:
die
Question: She was pretending to be happy for others, she would always what?
Options: A) religion, B) forget, C) smile, D) play, E) eat,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is putting on a façade of happiness, which is commonly expressed through a smile. The word "pretending" implies that the person is not actually feeling happy, but making an effort to appear happy to others. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence.
Answer:
smile
Question: Where can you work on needlepoint near the entrance of you home?
Options: A) sewing, B) frame, C) livingroom, D) sewing, E) artscraft store,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity of working on needlepoint is done near the entrance of your home, which is likely to be a common area such as a livingroom. The other options are less likely to be near the entrance of your home or may not be suitable for working on needlepoint.
Answer:
livingroom
Question: When potatoes aren't raised in town where are they raised?
Options: A) farm, B) cellar, C) restaurant, D) boiled, E) countryside,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that potatoes are not raised in town, which indicates that they must be raised in another location. The most likely option is the countryside, as this is where many farms are located and where crops like potatoes are typically grown. Cellars and restaurants are not locations where potatoes are raised, and boiling is a cooking method, not a location.
Answer:
countryside
Question: Some say they are at odds, but many find solace in both science and what?
Options: A) history studies, B) geography, C) religion, D) math, E) ghosts,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that science and another field are often viewed as conflicting or opposing, but many people find comfort in both. The other options, such as history studies, geography, math, and ghosts, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. However, the relationship between science and religion is often debated and discussed, so it makes sense that religion would be a possible answer.
Answer:
religion
Question: What does someone who does not feel alacrity or anything feel?
Options: A) apathy, B) detachment, C) indifference, D) hesitance, E) reluctance,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being described is not feeling any enthusiasm or energy towards something. Apathy is the lack of emotion or interest in something, which fits the context of the sentence. Detachment and indifference are also related to a lack of emotional attachment, but apathy specifically refers to a lack of feeling. Hesitance and reluctance imply a different emotion of not wanting to do something, rather than simply not feeling any emotion towards it.
Answer:
apathy

Options: A) ancient history, B) recent, C) stone age, D) storybook, E) ancient times,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the mammoth is currently extinct, and cloning it would bring it back to life. The term "ancient history" refers to something that happened a long time ago, and since mammoths are extinct, they are considered to be a part of ancient history. The other options do not fit the context as well because "recent" is the opposite of ancient and the other choices do not relate to prehistoric times.
Answer:
ancient history
Question: The troublemaker had been hoping for a soft punishment, but the ruling handed down was quite what?
Options: A) ruled, B) harsh, C) abrasive, D) hard, E) sensible,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the troublemaker anticipated a lenient punishment but received a severe or harsh one instead. The words "soft" and "harsh" contrast with each other, making "harsh" the more likely answer. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence.

Question: He had just drank poison, and the man who had given it to him was now mockingly showing the what?
Options: A) consumable, B) medicine, C) nutrient, D) dosage, E) antidote,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone has just consumed poison and another person is now taunting them. Given this context, it is logical to assume that the mockingly displayed item is likely to be connected to the poison, such as an antidote to counteract the effects of the poison. The other options, such as consumable, medicine, nutrient, and dosage, do not fit with the context or imply a negative intent on the part of the second person.
Answer:
antidote
Question: Where would you use a turnstile that does not require inserting a ticket?
Options: A) theatre, B) subway station, C) train station, D) amusement park, E) store,
Knowledge: Turnstiles are commonly used in locations where access needs to be controlled, such as ticketed events or transportation stations. The fact that this turnstile does not require a ticket suggests that it is likely used at a location where entry is already paid for, such as an amusement park. The other options may require a ticket to be inserted in a turnstile, or may not use turnstiles at all.
Answer:
amusement park
Question: Punishing innocent people with the death penalty should cause what?
Options: A) public outrage, B) get angry, C) going to jail, D) feel guilty, E) hatred,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that punishing innocent people with the death penalty is a morally reprehensible act that is likely to cause a negative public reaction. Public outrage is a common response to perceived injustices or violations of basic human rights, and it is likely to be particularly intense in cases where innocent people are put to death. The other options do not accurately reflect the likely consequences of this type of action.
Answer:
public outrage
Question: The fingers do this with the hand. What is it?
Options: A) sign language, B) scratch, C) articulate, D) cup water, E) soft,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity involving fingers and hands is related to movement or articulation. "Scratch," "cup water," and "soft" do not involve movement or articulation of the fingers in relation to the hand. "Sign language" is a possibility, but the sentence does not provide any other context or clues that suggest sign language would be the correct answer. Therefore, "articulate" is the best fit as it means to move the joints of the body, such as the fingers, in a precise and flexible way.
Answer:
articulate
Question: Where is the best place to keep personal lettuce?
Options: A) supermarket, B) farmer's market, C) pantry, D) refrigerator, E) salad,
Knowledge: Lettuce is a perishable vegetable that can wilt and spoil easily if not stored properly. The best place to store lettuce is in a refrigerator, which helps to keep it cool and crisp. The other options are not suitable for storing lettuce, as they do not provide the same level of temperature control and protection from moisture that a refrigerator does. The supermarket and farmer's market are places where lettuce is purchased, not stored. The pantry is often too warm and dry for lettuce, and salad is a dish that contains lettuce, but not a storage location.
Answer:
refrigerator
Question: Where would sunshine be likely to fall on a plant that a person owns?
Options: A) street, B) windowsill, C) disneyland, D) grow lights, E) summer,
Knowledge: The question suggests that a person owns a plant, which implies that the plant is likely located inside their home. Since plants require sunlight to grow, it is likely that the person has placed the plant on a windowsill to receive natural sunlight. The other options, such as street, Disneyland, or summer, do not provide any information about where the plant may be located or where sunlight may be falling on it. Grow lights may be used as an alternative to natural sunlight, but it is not mentioned in the question.
Answer:
windowsill
Question: What is a positive effect of expressing yourself?
Options: A) empowerment, B) misunderstanding, C) embarrassment, D) repercussions, E) falling down,
Knowledge: The question asks for a positive effect of expressing yourself, which means we should look for an option that has a positive connotation. Empowerment is a positive term that suggests a sense of confidence and control. Expressing yourself can help you feel more in control of your thoughts and feelings, and can give you a sense of empowerment over your life. The other options have negative connotations and are unlikely to be positive effects of expressing yourself.
Answer:
empowerment
Question: Danny sealed the small box and put it somewhere cozy and out of the way but easily accessible. Where might he put it?
Options: A) cellar, B) car, C) garage, D) closet, E) post office,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that Danny is storing something he wants to access easily but doesn't want it in the way. A closet is a logical option because it can be easily accessed but is out of the way. The other choices don't fit because a cellar and a garage are usually not cozy or easily accessible, a car is not a typical storage location, and the post office does not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
closet

Options: A) entertainment, B) train, C) motel, D) hotel, E) wedding,
Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is looking for both good bar service and a potential room to stay in afterwards, which is a service typically offered by hotels. The other options, such as train or wedding, do not provide these services. While some motels may offer bar service, they are generally associated with budget accommodations and may not have the same level of amenities as a hotel. Entertainment is also a vague option that may or may not include bar service or accommodations.
Answer:
hotel
Question: Where does someone ask for refills with a meal?
Options: A) restaurant, B) cup, C) sky, D) coffee shop, E) stationary store,

Options: A) envelopes, B) post office, C) mailbox, D) mail box, E) front door,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you're moving, the people in the current location will help you forward your mail to your new address. The correct answer must be a location where mail is collected and processed, such as a post office. Envelopes are the items that letters are sent in, but they are not the location where mail is processed. A mailbox or mail box is where mail is delivered, but it is not where it is processed or forwarded. The front door is not a location where mail is processed or delivered, it is the entrance to a building or house.
Answer:
post office

Options: A) music, B) jazz band, C) orchestra, D) nursery rhyme, E) music store,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man used his bass fiddle to play something simple and fun for his baby. A nursery rhyme fits this description, as they are often simple and catchy tunes that are enjoyable for children. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence - music and jazz band are too general, orchestra is too formal, and music store does not make sense in the context.
Answer:
nursery rhyme

Options: A) bar, B) cupboard, C) cabinet, D) containing drink, E) refrigerator,
Knowledge: Mugs are typically used for hot beverages like coffee and tea, and are usually stored in a cupboard or cabinet in the kitchen near the area where those beverages are brewed or prepared. The other options (bar, containing drink, and refrigerator) are not typical places to store mugs.

Options: A) ground, B) bright light, C) bridge, D) sunshine, E) beam,
Knowledge: Shadows are formed when an opaque object blocks the path of light, causing an absence of light in that area, and creating a shadow.

None of the other options, such as ground, bridge, sunshine, or beam, are directly involved in forming a shadow.
Answer:
bright light

Options: A) mysterious, B) very old, C) full of mysteries, D) infinite, E) real,

The other options may also be used to describe the universe, but "infinite" is the most fitting based on the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Options: A) own home, B) table to eat on, C) mansion, D) restaurant, E) table to eat on,
Knowledge: The use of the word "paid" and "dining room" suggests a commercial establishment that offers food service. The other options, such as "own home" and "table to eat on" do not necessarily entail payment, while "mansion" does not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Question: The man drank his coffee at work?
Options: A) coffee shop, B) table, C) kitchen, D) office, E) chair,

Question: Where might astronauts who miss a landing end up?
Options: A) spaceship, B) suface of moon, C) space shuttle, D) at the, E) orbit,
Knowledge: The question is asking about where astronauts who miss a landing might end up, suggesting that they did not reach their intended destination. The option "spaceship" is not a likely answer, as astronauts would already be in a spaceship to travel to their destination. The option "surface of moon" may be a possibility, but the context of the question suggests that the astronauts are still in space. The option "space shuttle" is not a likely answer, as astronauts would have to be in a shuttle to travel to their destination in the first place. The option "at the" is not a complete sentence and does not make sense in the context of the question. The option "orbit" makes the most sense, as astronauts who miss a landing could end up orbiting the moon, Earth, or another celestial body until they are rescued or can make it back to their intended destination.
Answer:

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person who gets drunk while on stairs is at risk of experiencing a physical mishap.

Question: Why would someone be committing murder?
Options: A) go to jail, B) guilty conscience, C) find god, D) problems, E) knife,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason why someone would commit murder, and "problems" is a broad and general answer that could encompass a variety of motivations such as financial difficulties, mental illness, personal grievances, or relationship issues. The other options are not necessarily related to committing a crime and do not provide reasonable explanations for murder. Going to jail would be a consequence of committing a criminal act, but it does not explain why someone would intentionally take someone's life. Guilty conscience and finding god are possible outcomes after committing murder, but they are not reasons for doing so. A knife is a tool that could be used to commit murder, but it does not provide insight into the perpetrator's motives.

Options: A) sufficient, B) plethora, C) lackbrain, D) enough, E) possessing,

Possessing is the correct answer because it means "to have or own something", which is the opposite of not having many belongings. Sufficient and enough are related to quantity or amount, but do not necessarily indicate ownership or possession. Plethora means "an excessive amount" and lackbrain is not a proper word.
Answer:
possessing

hamper

The phrase "want to be" implies that she wants to have some significance or value in his eyes. "Matter to" fits this context as it means to be important to someone or to be significant to them.

Options: A) become tired, B) get sleepy, C) feel full, D) getting fear, E) feeling satisfied,
Knowledge: The word "delicious" suggests that the person enjoyed their lunch, and feeling satisfied is a common reaction to enjoying a meal. Becoming tired or getting sleepy might happen after consuming a heavy or large meal, but it is not necessarily associated with a delicious lunch. Feeling full is a possibility, but it does not convey the enjoyment of the meal in the same way as feeling satisfied. Getting fear is not a common or logical response to having a delicious lunch, so that option can be eliminated.
Answer:
feeling satisfied

Answer:
jealousy

The other options do not accurately represent the severity of the situation described in the sentence. Although falling down, falling in, getting cold, and tripping and falling could all be negative consequences of skiing, they do not convey the seriousness suggested by the sentence.
Answer:

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker hasn't had rest recently, which implies that they may be feeling fatigued or tired. The option "exhausted" best captures this sense of extreme tiredness. The other options, such as "rested" or "muscles tired," do not convey the same level of fatigue as "exhausted." "Worked all day" may be a contributing factor to the speaker's exhaustion, but it does not necessarily capture the full extent of their tiredness.
Answer:

"Relaxation" is the most fitting choice among the options provided, as it relates directly to the idea of finding relief from the daily grind of work. "Unemployment" and "do nothing" are not necessarily positive states, and "earn money" is not a direct contrast to the idea of work being challenging. "Sleeping" may provide some relief, but it does not capture the idea of enjoying leisure time.

Options: A) lady's boudoir, B) suitcase, C) bedroom drawer, D) safe deposit box, E) department store,
Knowledge: The question is asking where to store jewelry if you do not plan to use it soon. A safe deposit box is a secure place to store valuable items, including jewelry, when they are not being used or worn. A lady's boudoir or bedroom drawer may be common places to store jewelry at home, but they may not be as secure as a safe deposit box. A suitcase is not a secure or recommended storage option for valuable items. A department store is not an appropriate storage location as it is a retail establishment, not a storage facility.

safe deposit box
Question: What is likely true about a dog that escapes regularly?
Options: A) very smart, B) very loyal, C) tired, D) friendly, E) faithful,

Dogs that are highly intelligent may be more prone to escaping because they have a greater awareness of their surroundings and are curious about exploring beyond their normal boundaries. The other options (loyal, tired, friendly, faithful) do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence and are not necessarily linked to a dog that escapes regularly.
Answer:

Options: A) make food, B) find food, C) prepare food, D) buy food, E) check your cat's mouth,

Although finding food in the wild is a possibility, the sentence suggests that the person is actively seeking a solution to their hunger rather than relying on chance. Checking a cat's mouth has nothing to do with procuring food for oneself.
Answer:
buy food

One potential benefit of running that is often cited is weight loss, so this choice is likely the correct answer.

Mouth wash and better health are not related to running in any obvious way.
Answer:
losing weight

The other options (frustration, ignore, injury, emotions) do not fit the context and have a negative connotation.

Options: A) fridge, B) wrist watch, C) office supply store, D) outside, E) desktop,
Knowledge: The question is asking about a common location for a calendar inside someone's home, which suggests it is likely to be a place where someone would see it frequently. This makes "desktop" a more likely option than "fridge" or "outside," which are typically not considered common locations for a calendar inside a home. "Wrist watch" and "office supply store" are also unlikely options as they do not relate to a specific location within the home.
Answer:

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the opening of the small beauty salon would have an impact on the local economy, which implies that it is located in a smaller, local area rather than in a larger city or strip mall. The phrase "locally owned" and "neighborhood" also imply a stronger connection to the immediate community. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
Answer:
neighborhood

Knowledge: The sentence implies that dogs experience itching, which is a common symptom of flea infestations.

Options: A) fidgeting, B) get tired, C) tiredness, D) cars, E) pain,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that standing in line is a difficult experience and there is likely to be some form of physical discomfort associated with it. The choice "tiredness" is the most fitting, as standing in line can cause fatigue or weariness over time, making it more difficult to maintain one's position in line.

Options: A) trying to stay happy, B) fall in love, C) doing sport, D) die, E) seeing,

Falling in love and doing sports are undoubtedly important aspects of life, but they are not necessarily overlooked or forgotten. Similarly, dying is simply a natural part of the life cycle, while 'seeing' could refer to a variety of things and does not necessarily relate to the question.
Answer:
trying to stay happy

Options: A) tune, B) practise, C) relaxing, D) ask questions, E) take lessons,
Knowledge: Learning to play the violin typically requires formal instruction, which is why "take lessons" is the correct answer. Tuning the violin, practicing regularly, and asking questions can all be helpful in the learning process, but without professional guidance, it is unlikely that someone can become proficient in playing the violin. Relaxing may be beneficial for reducing stress or anxiety before or after practice, but it is not directly related to learning to play the violin.
Answer:
take lessons
Question: Playing poker takes a lot of luck, but being consistent takes what?
Options: A) ante, B) happiness, C) skill, D) losing money, E) attention,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that playing poker involves an element of luck, but being successful in the game requires something else.

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:

Options: A) ugly, B) overweight, C) bad, D) average, E) hideous,
Knowledge: The sentence states that Sally isn't beautiful and describes her appearance as just plain. However, it is also mentioned that she has image issues and thinks that she is something negative.

The other choices do not necessarily describe Sally's self-perception accurately and are not supported by the given sentence.
Answer:
ugly

Options: A) getting drunk, B) need to urinate, C) sickness, D) loss of control, E) hangover,
Knowledge: The question mentions that the purpose of drinking was to get drunk, which implies that the individual consumed a significant amount of alcohol. Hangovers are commonly experienced after consuming large amounts of alcohol and are characterized by symptoms such as headache, nausea, and dehydration. The other options, such as getting drunk or loss of control, describe the act of drinking rather than the aftermath, while need to urinate and sickness can occur with or without alcohol consumption.
Answer:
hangover

Options: A) eath, B) pouring coffee, C) feel empty, D) get full, E) getting in line,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that having plenty to eat during lunch will result in a feeling of being satiated or full. "Getting in line" and "pouring coffee" are irrelevant to the context and don't make logical sense as answers, while "feel empty" is the opposite of what would happen if one had plenty to eat.
Answer:
get full
Question: Why do people like eating hamburgers?
Options: A) clogged arteries, B) tasty, C) have fun, D) indigestion, E) gain weight,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that people enjoy eating hamburgers, which suggests that taste is a primary factor. Clogged arteries, indigestion, and weight gain are all negative consequences associated with consuming too much fast food, which suggests they are not typically reasons why people like eating hamburgers. "Having fun" is also a possible reason, as hamburgers are a common food choice for social gatherings and backyard BBQs, but it is not mentioned in the sentence.
Answer:
tasty
Question: What happens when you try to help someone but make it worse?
Options: A) succeed, B) do nothing, C) anticipate, D) hinder, E) hurting,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action of trying to help someone has had a negative effect, which is commonly referred to as "hindering" their progress or situation. The other options do not match the context of the sentence. Succeed and anticipate both suggest a positive outcome, while do nothing suggests no effect at all. Hurting may also suggest a negative outcome, but it does not match the context of trying to help someone.
Answer:
hinder
Question: Where do older people sometimes want to hear the singer more than the music?
Options: A) elevator, B) opera, C) carnival, D) music hall, E) night club,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a specific type of venue or event where older people are more likely to appreciate the singer's performance than the actual music being played.

The other options do not have a strong association with the context of the sentence.
Answer:
opera

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Alexa is looking for a safe and secure place to store her acoustic guitar when she is not playing it. Among the choices provided, a closet would be the best option as it provides privacy and security, and the guitar can be safely stored away from any potential hazards that could damage it. The other options, such as a drawer, music shop, house, or studio, may not offer the same level of security or privacy for Alexa's guitar.
Answer:
closet
Question: What do you physically do to someone that you love?
Options: A) kiss, B) kill, C) forgive, D) paint, E) please parents,
Knowledge: The question is asking for a physical action associated with love. Kissing is a well-known expression of love and affection, frequently used in romantic relationships, familial relationships, and even friendships.

Forgiving or pleasing parents may be actions taken out of love, but they are not physical expressions like kissing.
Answer:
kiss
Question: What do people watch television to become?
Options: A) see favorite show, B) be quiet, C) get comfortable, D) you're bored, E) entertained,
Knowledge: Watching television is often associated with entertainment, as people tune in to see their favorite shows or programs that are designed to provide amusement or diversion from daily life. While it is true that some people may watch television to be quiet or get comfortable, these reasons do not fully capture the main purpose of watching television, which is to be entertained. Additionally, the option "you're bored" may be a reason someone watches television, but it is not a goal or outcome that someone hopes to achieve.
Answer:
entertained

Options: A) relief, B) meditation, C) confusing god, D) being comforted, E) contemplation,

Therefore, it is likely that someone who is praying while waiting for an outcome may feel comforted by the belief that they are not alone and that their prayer may be answered. The other options may be possible outcomes of praying in different contexts, but they do not necessarily apply to the specific question being asked.
Answer:
being comforted
Question: What is a risk of going on vacation?
Options: A) overspending, B) staying there, C) relaxing, D) pleasant thoughts, E) enjoy,
Knowledge: Going on vacation can be enjoyable and relaxing, but it also comes with potential risks.

This can lead to financial stress or debt if not planned and managed carefully. The other options in the choices are not risks, but rather outcomes or feelings associated with going on vacation.
Answer:
overspending

Options: A) chew, B) eating, C) digest, D) prepare, E) eat food,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the man wanted to have food ready for the work week, which suggests that he would need to prepare his meals in advance. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence: chewing and eating both refer to the act of consuming food, while digesting is a natural bodily process that occurs after eating.
Answer:
prepare
Question: Where would someone find freshest possible eggs?
Options: A) supermarket, B) grocery store, C) in a salad, D) bird's nest, E) chicken coop,
Knowledge: Eggs are typically freshest when they are collected directly from the source, which would be a chicken coop in this case. Supermarkets and grocery stores may sell fresh eggs that are still relatively close to their collection date, but they may not be as fresh as eggs from a chicken coop. Eggs would not typically be found in a salad as a whole, and certainly not fresh ones. Similarly, eggs would not be found in a bird's nest as they would likely already be hatched and gone.
Answer:
chicken coop
Question: Where will you store a bowl while not in use?
Options: A) apartment, B) outside, C) dishwasher, D) cabinet, E) restaurant,
Knowledge: Cabinets are a common storage solution for bowls in homes and kitchens. They provide a secure and protected space for the bowl, while keeping it easily accessible for future use. The other options are not viable storage locations for a bowl - apartments are not specific enough, outside leaves the bowl exposed to the elements, the dishwasher is not a storage solution, and a restaurant would not be a personal storage location.
Answer:
cabinet
Question: The child wanted to test electricity, so what did he feel as a result?
Options: A) cause fire, B) shock, C) short fuse, D) kill if used improperly, E) produce heat,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child was experimenting with electricity, which can be dangerous if not handled properly. The word "feel" implies that the child experienced a physical sensation as a result of their experiment.

The other options do not accurately reflect the potential dangers of experimenting with electricity.
Answer:
shock

Options: A) ignore, B) delete, C) forward, D) question, E) ask,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person found the email funny, but did not reply to it. The word "although" also implies that the person did something else with the email. Of the choices provided, "forward" is the most likely option, as the person may have wanted to share the funny email with someone else. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not involve any action being taken with the email.
Answer:
forward
Question: Dad is putting away folding chairs after a party, where does he store them?
Options: A) church, B) garage, C) attic, D) room, E) closet,
Knowledge: In the context of the sentence, it's reasonable to assume that the folding chairs are larger items that require some space. Churches, attics, rooms, and closets are typically not large enough to store multiple folding chairs. On the other hand, garages are often used for storage of larger items like cars, bicycles, and outdoor equipment, making it the most likely option for storing folding chairs after a party.
Answer:
garage
Question: If you see policemen outside wearing safety vest and holding flashlights, what are they doing?
Options: A) corner thief, B) help, C) searching in dark, D) direct traffic, E) hurry along,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the policemen are wearing safety vests and holding flashlights, which are common tools used for directing traffic.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
direct traffic

Out of the options provided, stress relief is the most directly linked to this theme. Studies show that having fun and engaging in enjoyable activities can help to reduce stress levels and improve mood. The other options (glee, smiling, twinkle, may laugh) are related to happiness or expression of emotions, but they do not specifically address the psychological benefits of having fun.
Answer:
stress relief

Options: A) buffalo, B) hospital, C) birdhouse, D) mansion, E) large building,
Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the school has three wings and enough space for 5000 students, which implies that it is a large building capable of accommodating a significant number of people. The other choices, such as buffalo, hospital, birdhouse, and mansion, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to describe a school in this manner.
Answer:
large building

Options: A) orchestra, B) school band, C) music store, D) opera house, E) symphony,

The other options, such as a school band or a music store, do not fit the context of the sentence as well.
Answer:
opera house
Question: The farmer is making grow a tomato, what does he specialize?
Options: A) flowering, B) barn, C) growth, D) plants, E) more of,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the farmer is growing a specific type of plant, which is a tomato. Therefore, it can be inferred that the farmer specializes in cultivating plants. The other choices, such as flowering or barn, do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence. The word "growth" could be a potential answer, but it is not specific enough as it does not mention what is growing.
Answer:
plants
Question: James was planning a vacation. he was doing this because he worked hard and needed something. What did he need?
Options: A) stock options, B) arguments, C) spending money, D) relaxation, E) enjoying,

Answer:
relaxation
Question: The alley cats were all beginning to gather together, but one loud crash sent them all what?
Options: A) disburse, B) charming, C) scattering, D) spread, E) dispense,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the alley cats were all gathering together, but then something caused them to suddenly move or scatter in different directions.

The other options do not accurately reflect the sudden and chaotic movement described in the sentence.
Answer:
scattering
Question: What is something that comes from your voice?
Options: A) volume, B) loud, C) being heard, D) beautiful, E) sound,
Knowledge: The question is asking for something that is produced by the voice, and the word "sound" is a direct result of vibrations in the vocal cords. Volume and loudness both refer to the level of sound produced, while being heard is more of a passive action that results from the sound being produced. "Beautiful" is subjective and not necessarily related to the production of sound itself.
Answer:
sound
Question: What might someone be trying to achieve by getting wet?
Options: A) could, B) get cold, C) shrinking, D) cool off, E) shower,
Knowledge: The act of getting wet is often associated with trying to achieve a cooling effect. When we get wet, whether through swimming or taking a shower, the water helps to lower our body temperature by conducting heat away from our skin. The option "get cold" may seem like a viable choice given the context, but it implies a passive state rather than an active pursuit. "Shrinking" is not a practical goal for most people when getting wet, and "shower" is a specific way of getting wet rather than a general purpose.
Answer:
cool off
Question: Where would the heifer go to join her herd?
Options: A) slaughterhouse, B) cow palace, C) dairy farm, D) cow pasture, E) barnyard,
Knowledge: The word "herd" refers to a group of grazing animals, typically cows or other livestock. The options "slaughterhouse" and "dairy farm" suggest that the heifer will be used for meat or milk production, which is not mentioned in the question. "Cow palace" is not a typical term used to describe a place where cows graze or live. "Barnyard" could be a possibility, but it is a more general term that could refer to any area where livestock are kept, while "cow pasture" specifically refers to an open grazing area for cows.
Answer:
cow pasture
Question: The audience sits enthralled watching a spectacular battle full of shooting and explosions.  Where is the audience most likely to be?
Options: A) church, B) hockey game, C) movie theater, D) new york stadium, E) stadium,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that what the audience is watching is a form of entertainment. Out of the given choices, only a movie theater is typically associated with showing movies that contain scenes of battles, shooting, and explosions. The other options, such as a church or a hockey game, do not typically involve this type of content. While stadiums may host events that feature battles or explosions, the mention of "New York Stadium" in particular is unlikely to be relevant to the sentence.
Answer:
movie theater
Question: When not playing your mandolin, where would you store it?
Options: A) closet, B) musical instrument store, C) instrument case, D) music shop, E) music store,
Knowledge: The question implies that the mandolin needs to be stored somewhere when not in use. Among the options provided, closet is unlikely to be the correct answer since it does not provide proper protection for the instrument. Musical instrument store, music shop, and music store are not suitable answers as they are places where instruments are sold, not stored. The most logical answer is instrument case, as it is designed specifically for the purpose of storing and protecting musical instruments.
Answer:
instrument case
Question: How do the bosses share knowledge in person at work?
Options: A) meeting, B) dinner, C) encyclopedia, D) class, E) university,

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the audience is likely watching a sports game or activity where a ball is being used. This type of event usually takes place in a stadium, where there is a large open space for players to move around and spectators to watch from various angles. The other options do not typically have events that involve a ball being thrown or hit.
Answer:
stadium
Question: If children are happy, what do they do?
Options: A) enjoyed, B) skip, C) sleep, D) awesome, E) watch television,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that when children are happy, they engage in some kind of physical activity that indicates their joy, as opposed to passive activities like watching TV or sleeping. Skipping is a form of physical expression that is often associated with happiness and carefree behavior in children, hence it is the most appropriate option among the given choices. 'Enjoyed' is a past participle and cannot be used to describe actions in the present tense. 'Sleep' and 'watch television' are not indicative of children's happiness in this context, and 'awesome' is an adjective that does not describe an action.
Answer:
skip
Question: If a phoneless person needs to make a call from a public phone, where might they find one?
Options: A) office, B) desktop, C) neighbor's house, D) movie theater, E) rest area,
Knowledge: Public phones are typically found in places where people may need to make calls but do not have access to a personal phone, such as rest areas along highways. The other options do not typically have public phones available, and it would be unusual to find a public phone in an office or someone's house.
Answer:
rest area
Question: A quarter of it was twenty five pounds, so the whole was what?
Options: A) school year, B) hundredweight, C) upper, D) century, E) hour,
Knowledge: A "quarter" typically refers to 25% of something, and in this sentence, it is specified that the quarter in question has a weight of 25 pounds. This suggests that the item being weighed is likely measured in pounds or something similar, which rules out choices like "school year," "upper," and "century." "Hour" is also not a likely answer, as it is a unit of time rather than weight. "Hundredweight," on the other hand, is a unit of weight that equals 100 pounds, and therefore fits with the information provided in the sentence.
Answer:
hundredweight
Question: John didn't have to ride his bike.  He did it for only one reason. What reason is that?
Options: A) thirst, B) enjoyment, C) for fun, D) pleasure, E) fatigue,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John did not have to ride his bike, but he still did it for a reason. The reason is likely to be something that is enjoyable or pleasurable to him, since he was not doing it out of necessity such as thirst or fatigue. The options "for fun" and "pleasure" are synonymous with enjoyment and fit the context of the sentence.
Answer:
enjoyment
Question: The play was nearly starting, everybody took their seat in the what?
Options: A) show, B) in cinema, C) theatre, D) bench, E) martorell,
Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the play was about to start, which is a clear indication that the setting is a theatrical performance. The choice "theatre" refers to a venue specifically designed for stage performances, which would be the most likely location for the play to take place. The other options, such as "show" or "in cinema," are too vague to accurately describe the setting implied by the sentence. "Bench" and "Martorell" are unlikely options as they don't directly relate to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
theatre
Question: Where does a cast act?
Options: A) perform, B) stage, C) cast net, D) film, E) broken leg,
Knowledge: In the context of theater or acting, a cast typically refers to the group of actors who perform on stage. The word "perform" is also commonly associated with acting and theater, further supporting the idea that the correct answer is "stage." The other options, such as "cast net" and "broken leg," are unrelated to acting or theater. "Film" might also be a valid answer, but it is less specific than "stage" and could refer to acting in movies or television shows as well.
Answer:
stage
Question: Dancing poorly in public may make you feel what?
Options: A) exhaustion, B) recognizance, C) blisters, D) humiliation, E) fatigue,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that dancing poorly in public can lead to a negative emotional experience. The word "humiliation" specifically denotes a feeling of shame or embarrassment, which would be appropriate in this context. The other options don't necessarily convey a negative emotional experience related to dancing poorly, such as exhaustion or fatigue (which are physical sensations) and blisters or recognizance (which don't necessarily indicate a negative emotional experience).
Answer:
humiliation
Question: What is the object with a point used for mountain climbing?
Options: A) hat, B) arrowhead, C) needle, D) alpenstock, E) waterpoint,
Knowledge: The sentence describes an object with a point that is used for mountain climbing. This eliminates choices such as hat, arrowhead, and needle, which are not associated with mountain climbing equipment. Waterpoint is also unlikely, as it does not have a point and is not used for climbing. Alpenstock, on the other hand, is a type of pole or stick used specifically for mountain climbing and is known for its pointed tip.
Answer:
alpenstock
Question: THe apiarist bought a new queen, where was the queen bound?
Options: A) england, B) beehive, C) farmyard, D) monarchy, E) deck of cards,
Knowledge: Apiarists are beekeepers, and the term "queen" refers to the female bee responsible for laying eggs and leading the hive. To introduce a new queen to a hive, the apiarist typically cages her or binds her wings to prevent her from leaving. The logical answer to the question, therefore, is "beehive." The other options, such as "England," "monarchy," or "deck of cards," have no apparent connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
beehive
Question: Where are there more than 1 trillion planets like earth?
Options: A) god's creation, B) ball stopped, C) gravity, D) milky way, E) universe,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are more than 1 trillion planets that are similar to Earth. This is a statistical estimate that is difficult to confirm, but it suggests that the number of planets like Earth is very large. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. "God's creation" is a religious concept and not a scientific explanation for the existence of planets. "Ball stopped" and "gravity" are physical concepts that do not relate to the number of planets in the universe. The Milky Way is a galaxy, but the sentence suggests that there are more than 1 trillion planets like Earth in the entire universe, not just one galaxy.
Answer:
universe

Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John is attempting to start a fire, which is commonly done by using a match or other ignition source. The other options do not fit the context as there is no indication that John is frustrated, trying to illuminate anything, or trying to intentionally set something on fire.
Answer:
make fire

Treetops and busy are also not directly related to the monkey's behavior or emotions.
Answer:
playful mood

Options: A) happiness, B) tears, C) sit, D) being entertained, E) laugh,
Knowledge: Going to play is typically seen as a fun and enjoyable activity for children, which would lead to a positive emotional response such as happiness.

Options: A) london, B) city, C) town, D) apartment building, E) condominium,
Knowledge: Flats are typically found in larger structures like apartment buildings, whereas options like London, City, and Town are too broad and do not appropriately capture the context of the question. Condominiums can also refer to individual units like flats, but they are not always grouped together in a larger building as frequently as flats are.
Answer:
apartment building
Question: I only like fiction books, why should I read a non-fiction book?
Options: A) knowledge, B) been printed new, C) many words, D) for fun, E) cover,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person only enjoys reading fiction books, but there may be a benefit to reading a non-fiction book. The answer "knowledge" is the most logical choice, as non-fiction books are often written to teach readers about a particular subject or provide information about real events. By reading a non-fiction book, the person could expand their knowledge and learn something new. The other options (been printed new, many words, for fun, cover) do not provide a compelling reason to read a non-fiction book.
Answer:
knowledge
Question: Where would you be most likely to see a cow?
Options: A) road, B) slaughter house, C) ranch, D) switzerland, E) tennessee,
Knowledge: Cows are typically raised on farms or ranches for their milk, meat, or as draft animals. Therefore, the correct answer would be "ranch." The other options, such as "road" and "slaughterhouse," do not make sense in the context of where a cow would be present, while "Switzerland" and "Tennessee" do not provide any information about where cows are located.
Answer:
ranch

Options: A) misrepresent, B) cover up, C) offer price, D) deceive, E) leave town,
Knowledge: A real estate agent's primary job is to help their customers find a suitable property within their budget. Offering a price is a common action that a real estate agent could take in order to negotiate a deal with the seller of a house. Misrepresenting, covering up, deceiving, or leaving town are all unethical or illegal actions that a real estate agent should not engage in. These options do not align with the responsibilities of a real estate agent.
Answer:
offer price
Question: What is someone looking for in a new mattress when returning one that had lots of rigidity?
Options: A) ductility, B) empity, C) softness, D) flexibility, E) malleability,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person did not like the previous mattress because it was too rigid or hard, so they are likely seeking a mattress that is softer and more comfortable. Out of the choices given, ductility, malleability, and flexibility all refer to a object's ability to bend or change shape, which is not directly related to comfort. Empity is not a word, and therefore cannot be the answer.
Answer:
softness

Options: A) reproduction, B) junior, C) copy, D) derivative, E) remake,
Knowledge: The question refers to creating a new version of an existing movie, which is commonly known as a remake. The term reproduction refers to creating a copy of an original artwork or document, and may not fit the context of the question. Junior is not commonly used in this context. Copy and derivative could apply to many types of media, not only movies, and may not provide enough specificity to answer the question accurately.
Answer:
remake
Question: An over-heated snake will hide where in a house?
Options: A) bedroom, B) tropical forest, C) oklahoma, D) basement, E) river,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that an over-heated snake will seek shelter in a house, and the correct answer is likely a location in a house that is cooler than other areas. Basements are typically cooler than other parts of a house, which would make it a likely hiding place for an over-heated snake. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.
Answer:
basement

Options: A) workplace, B) gravesite, C) shelter, D) interesting place, E) temperate climate,
Knowledge: The question asks for the easiest place to live, which suggests a place that provides ideal conditions for survival. A temperate climate is typically characterized by moderate temperatures, with neither extreme heat nor extreme cold, which can be ideal for humans and many other animals to live in. The other options do not provide clear benefits for survival, and in some cases (such as gravesites), are not suitable for living at all.
Answer:
temperate climate
Question: There is a hard substance that must take on different forms, what are these forms?
Options: A) ice cream , B) chipped, C) formed into cubes, D) antarctica, E) found in artic,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a hard substance can take on different forms, which implies that it is something that can be manipulated or molded in different ways. The option "formed into cubes" best fits this description, as it suggests a solid substance that can be shaped into different forms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Ice cream" is not a hard substance and "chipped" and "found in Arctic" do not necessarily imply different forms.
Answer:
formed into cubes
Question: Where would I put a rosebush if I did not want to keep it outside?
Options: A) pot, B) garden center, C) front lawn, D) formal garden, E) backyard,
Knowledge: The question asks for a location to put a rosebush if the person does not want to keep it outside, implying that the rosebush needs to be kept indoors. Therefore, the correct answer would be a pot or container, which allows the individual to keep the rosebush indoors and move it around if needed. The other options suggest outdoor locations and are not appropriate for an indoor plant.
Answer:
pot

Options: A) foot pain, B) shin splints, C) increased heart rate, D) being healthy, E) knee pain,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone jogging has a long-term goal in mind, which is likely related to their health. Jogging is a popular form of exercise that can help improve cardiovascular health, increase overall fitness, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. The other options are potential negative outcomes of jogging and would not be goals someone would want to achieve.
Answer:
being healthy
Question: What has an accelerator and is owned by most people?
Options: A) vehical, B) fuel system, C) accelerate, D) airplane, E) car,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being referred to has an accelerator and is owned by most people. Airplanes are not commonly owned by most people, but rather by airlines or aviation companies. Fuel systems and accelerate are not objects that can be owned, but rather parts or actions associated with a vehicle. Therefore, the correct answer would be "car," which is a vehicle commonly owned by individuals and has an accelerator.
Answer:
car
Question: After suffering a bad injury, where will a person get taken?
Options: A) hockey game, B) home, C) hospital, D) emergency room, E) doctor's office,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person sustained a significant injury that requires medical attention. While a doctor's office or an emergency room could also be options for medical care, the mention of a "bad" injury implies that the person may need more extensive treatment than a doctor's office could provide. The other options, such as a hockey game or home, do not make sense in the context of someone needing medical attention for an injury.
Answer:
hospital

Knowledge: Baseball stadiums are typically located in urban areas because they require a large amount of space and accessibility for fans. Urban areas provide the necessary infrastructure, transportation, and population density to support a major league baseball stadium. The other options, such as other countries or specific cities, do not make as much sense as they do not have a universal connection to where baseball stadiums are commonly located.
Answer:
urban areas
Question: If you haven't been sleeping well you are probably what?
Options: A) time to sleep, B) tired, C) closing eyes, D) falling down, E) darkness,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that not sleeping well leads to a certain feeling or state. Being tired is a common symptom of not getting enough sleep, which is why it is the correct answer. The other options do not accurately describe the feeling or state associated with sleep deprivation. "Time to sleep" is a suggestion, "closing eyes" is a physical action, "falling down" suggests a loss of balance or consciousness and "darkness" refers to the absence of light.
Answer:

Options: A) magazine article, B) safe deposit box, C) glove box, D) library, E) book,
Knowledge: The question asks for the best place to store important documents such as a car title or home deed. A safe deposit box is a secure place to store valuable items, such as important documents, jewelry, and other items that are difficult or impossible to replace if lost or stolen. A glove box or library book would not provide adequate security, and a magazine article is not a suitable place for storing important documents.
Answer:
safe deposit box
Question: When two people who love each other are alone, they will probably try to contact each other and get what?
Options: A) with others, B) with people, C) crowded, D) together, E) contact,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when two people who love each other are alone, they will want to be in each other's company and not be with other people or in a crowded setting. The word "contact" in this context means to connect or communicate with each other. Therefore, the most logical answer is "together." The other options do not make sense in the given sentence.
Answer:
together

Options: A) file cabinet, B) file folder, C) hospital, D) cabinet, E) desk drawer,
Knowledge: A paper clip is a small office supply commonly used to attach or hold together sheets of paper. It is often kept in a desk drawer because it is a frequently used item in an office setting.

Question: what is the end result of hiring a maid?
Options: A) clean bathroom, B) cleaning house, C) an affair, D) clean room, E) clean house,
Knowledge: The word "maid" typically refers to someone who is hired to clean and maintain a house, so the end result of hiring a maid is likely to have a clean house. The other options are less likely outcomes, with "an affair" being completely unrelated to the context of the sentence.

Options: A) shoe box, B) suitcase, C) synagogue, D) briefcase, E) backpack,
Knowledge: The context suggests that the businessman carried the book with him to work, as he kept it "beneath all his work." The most likely place for him to store a book that he carries with him to work would be in his briefcase. The other options, such as a shoe box, backpack, or synagogue, do not seem highly practical or appropriate for storing a book that is meaningful to a businessman.
Answer:
briefcase
Question: After the loss, we really need one of these?
Options: A) contemplate, B) win, C) gain, D) money, E) profit,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject has experienced a loss and is looking for something to help them feel better. "Win" is the most likely answer as it is the opposite of "loss" and could bring a sense of victory or accomplishment. "Contemplate" and "gain" may be too abstract or unrelated to the context. "Money" and "profit" may have a positive connotation, but they do not necessarily suggest a solution to the problem at hand.
Answer:
win
Question: What does a projectile pass through?
Options: A) battle field, B) air, C) gun, D) weapon, E) baseball,
Knowledge: A projectile is an object that is launched into the air and travels through it until it hits a target. In this question, the options "battlefield," "gun," and "weapon" suggest a context of warfare where projectiles might be used, but none of them correctly answer the question as they do not describe what the projectile passes through. "Baseball" is also unrelated to the question. The correct answer is "air" because it is the medium through which a projectile travels.
Answer:
air
Question: What is beginning work likely to lead to a day of?
Options: A) sleeping, B) momentum, C) stress, D) excitement, E) working,
Knowledge: The question is asking what beginning work is likely to lead to, which implies that the answer should be related to work or the workday. While options like sleeping and excitement may be things we experience before or after work, they do not directly answer the question of what beginning work is likely to lead to. The option "momentum" could be a possibility, but it is not clear how it relates to the specific context of beginning work. Therefore, the most logical answer is "working," as beginning work is likely to lead to a day of work. The option "stress" could also be a possibility, but it would depend on the context and personal experience of the individual.
Answer:
working

Options: A) restaurant, B) restorand, C) church basement, D) feel relaxed, E) wedding party,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person is waiting for food, which is commonly associated with being in a restaurant. The other options (church basement, wedding party) do not have any clear connection to waiting for food. The misspelling of "restaurant" as "restorand" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence. The option "feel relaxed" may be a desirable outcome of being in a restaurant, but it is not an action that a person would physically do in the reception area.
Answer:
restaurant
Question: If someone is a gentleman in a professional setting what would he wear?
Options: A) tshirt, B) europe, C) suit, D) club, E) church,

The most formal option listed is a suit, which is commonly worn by men in professional or business settings. The other options, such as tshirt or club attire, are not appropriate for a professional setting. Europe and church do not provide enough information to suggest a specific type of attire.
Answer:
suit
Question: In using computers where one thoroughly enjoys himself what may ensue?

Knowledge: The phrase "thoroughly enjoys himself" suggests that the person may become addicted to using the computer. This is a common problem with technology and can have negative effects on a person's health and well-being. The other options do not necessarily follow from the sentence or are not related to computer use (e.g. sitting).
Answer:
addiction

Options: A) had to say, B) separate, C) sever, D) pull apart, E) sever,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jennifer's behavior had negative consequences on her connections with others. The words "abrasive" and "clingy" imply that she was difficult to be around, which could lead people to pull away and, eventually, sever the connection entirely. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence.
Answer:
sever
Question: Where do lizards like to sun themselves?
Options: A) garden, B) jazz club, C) tropical rainforest, D) rocky places, E) tanning bed,
Knowledge: Lizards are known to be cold-blooded animals that rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature. They will often bask in the sun on rocks or other warm surfaces to raise their body temperature. Therefore, rocky places would be the most suitable location for lizards to sun themselves. The other options are not natural habitats for lizards, and a tanning bed is not conducive to the needs of these animals.
Answer:
rocky places
Question: What do people make with crab?
Options: A) delicious meal, B) chinese market, C) fish market, D) aquarium, E) tidal flats,
Knowledge: Crab is a commonly consumed seafood, and people often make various dishes and meals using crab meat. The other options are not directly related to the context of the question and do not provide information about what people typically make with crab. The Chinese market may sell crab as a food item, but it is not a specific answer to the question. The fish market may sell a variety of seafood, including crab, but it does not indicate what people make with crab. The aquarium and tidal flats are not related to the use of crab for food.
Answer:
delicious meal
Question: Sean was an honest person, but his married June, who wasn't honest at all. In fact, who was very what?
Options: A) untruthful, B) liar, C) untrustworthy, D) disloyal, E) deceitful,
Knowledge: The sentence contrasted Sean's honesty with June's lack of honesty, indicating that she is not simply untruthful or a liar, but rather deceitful. Deceitfulness implies a deliberate intention to deceive or mislead others, which goes beyond simply being untruthful or unreliable. The other options may be synonyms of deceitful in some contexts, but do not capture the same level of intentional deception.
Answer:
deceitful
Question: What do you use to catch a mouse?
Options: A) disneyland, B) cupboard, C) sewer, D) a large bottle of valium, E) trap,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the task is to catch a mouse. The most common and effective way to do this is by using a trap specifically designed for catching mice.

Answer:
trap

Options: A) own home, B) front door, C) pocket, D) garden gnome, E) purse,
Knowledge: The sentence implies that the woman had a spare key with her, and the most logical place to keep a spare key while out and about would be in her purse. The other options do not make as much sense as a place to keep a spare key, as they are either unrelated or not practical for carrying a spare key.
Answer:
purse
Question: which door with lock regularly holds cars?
Options: A) house, B) autolock, C) garage, D) file cabinet, E) safe,

Question: The bulky man enjoyed to eat hamburger or anything else high in what?
Options: A) protein, B) crack, C) cook one, D) satisfy hunger, E) good to eat,
Knowledge: The use of the word "bulky" suggests that the man is likely interested in building or maintaining muscle mass, which requires consuming adequate amounts of protein. Hamburger is a relatively high protein food, so this aligns with the sentence. "Crack" and "cook one" are not related to the context of the sentence and "good to eat" and "satisfy hunger" are too general and do not provide a clear answer.
Answer:
protein
Question: Where could you find a steel cable that has not been completed yet?
Options: A) winch, B) factory, C) roller coaster, D) ship, E) building,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the steel cable has not been completed yet, which means it is in the process of being manufactured. A factory is the most likely place to find a steel cable that has not been completed yet because it is where steel cables are typically produced. The other options – winch, roller coaster, ship, and building – are not logical places to find an incomplete steel cable, as they are not typically associated with the production of steel cables.
Answer:
factory
Question: Where were the cowboys herding the heifers across the property towards?
Options: A) deep sea, B) slaughterhouse, C) cattle ranch, D) countryside, E) barnyard,

Answer:
cattle ranch
Question: If you want to bake something, but do not have butter, where would you get it?
Options: A) pastry, B) homes, C) neighbor, D) store, E) refrigerator,
Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is looking to obtain butter to use for baking. While it is possible they may have stored some butter in their refrigerator, this is not a guarantee. Similarly, using butter from a neighbor or pastry shop may not be an option. However, a store is a likely place to find butter for purchase.
Answer:
store

Question: When someone moves to another state, they are what from you?
Options: A) there, B) nearby, C) far, D) in sight, E) being here,
Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being referred to has moved to a different state, which implies a significant physical distance from the speaker. "Far" is the most appropriate word to describe this type of distance. "There" refers to the location where the person has moved and does not inherently imply a specific distance. "Nearby" implies close proximity, which contradicts the idea of the person being far away. "In sight" and "being here" imply that the person is still nearby and visible, which again contradicts the idea of them being far away.
Answer:
far
Question: What handle did the man grab to when he wanted a snack?
Options: A) fridge, B) hardware store, C) frying pan, D) water fountain, E) drawer,

The other options do not make sense in this context as they are not commonly used to store food items. A hardware store sells tools and equipment, a frying pan is used for cooking, a water fountain dispenses water, and a drawer is used to store non-refrigerated items.
