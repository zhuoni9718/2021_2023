Options: A: community kitchen,B: the post office,C: apartment,D: friend's house,E: tent, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that John bought a small butane stove that he can't use inside due to fumes. This suggests that he will need to use it in an outdoor setting. Options such as community kitchen, post office, and apartment do not have any clear connection to outdoor activities, leaving us with two options - friend's house or tent.

Options: A: stay alive,B: get rid of,C: attacked,D: defend yourself,E: fall down, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is being attacked, therefore they need to protect themselves from harm. "Defend yourself" is the only option that addresses this need. "Stay alive" is a general advice that may not be useful in the specific situation of being attacked.

The option "casualties" refers to a group and not an individual and does not reflect the specific situation described in the sentence. The option "protect yourself" does not fit the sentence as it is not a possible outcome for someone with a grave injury. The option "death" is also a possible outcome, but it is not the one indicated in the sentence, as the person is still alive but in critical condition. Answer is
--target-- dying

--target-- cave

Options: A: internet cafe,B: display images,C: box,D: view bluescreen,E: desktop, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James connected the new monitor to something that would allow him to use it to display images, indicating that it was likely connected to a computer or other device with display capabilities. The options "internet cafe" and "view bluescreen" do not make sense in this context, and "box" is not a viable option for connecting a monitor. Therefore, "desktop" is the most logical answer. Answer is
--target-- desktop

Options: A: table,B: kitchen drawer,C: fishing boat,D: pocket,E: board, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the context is related to fishing, since it mentions cleaning a catch. The other options like table or kitchen drawer are not related to fishing, while pocket and board do not make sense in the context of cleaning a catch.

The option "eat cake" is clearly not related to the context of the sentence, and the others could potentially be used for research in writing, but the use of a dictionary specifically points towards writing a novel as the best answer. Answer is

Options: A: bath room,B: motel room,C: pool,D: locker room,E: at hotel, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that taking a shower in a particular location can be intimidating for shy kids in school. The most likely location for this scenario is a locker room, where students often change and shower in a shared space.

Options: A: eat cake,B: little boy's toy box,C: theater,D: bathtub,E: toy store, Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking about where to acquire an action figure. The options "eat cake," "theater," and "bathtub" do not provide a plausible answer to this question, as they are not places where one would typically find or purchase an action figure. However, "little boy's toy box" may seem like a possible answer, but it is not a guaranteed source of an action figure, whereas a toy store explicitly sells toys, including action figures. Answer is
--target-- toy store
--input-- Question: He was studying anatomy, he knew that the main artery in his neck provided blood to his what? Options: A: own brain,B: busy city,C: thruway,D: hand,E: neck, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is studying anatomy and is aware of the main artery in the neck. Given that the heart pumps blood to the rest of the body through arteries, it is likely that the person is referring to the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain.

--input-- Question: Where might a child go who has no home? Options: A: school,B: orphanage,C: most homes,D: recreational,E: pen, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the child in question does not have a home. Therefore, it is likely that the child would go to a place that provides shelter, such as an orphanage. Schools and recreational areas are not typically designed to provide long-term housing, and "most homes" does not make sense in the context provided. "Pen" is unlikely to be the correct answer as it does not provide any clues to a potential solution for a homeless child. Answer is
--target-- orphanage
--input-- Question: Crabs crawl along the bottom of what? Options: A: bodies of water,B: fish market,C: aquarium,D: saltwater,E: galapagos, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the crabs are moving along the bottom of some type of body of water. The options "fish market" and "aquarium" do not fit the context of the sentence, as crabs in those locations would not typically be crawling along the bottom of anything. "Saltwater" is a possibility, but it is too broad and does not provide enough specificity. "Galapagos" is also too specific and does not fit the general context of the sentence, which suggests that the crabs could be in any body of water. Therefore, the correct answer is "bodies of water." Answer is
--target-- bodies of water
--input-- Question: Almost everyone who has been driving a car has seen or been in a what? Options: A: getting tired,B: go somewhere,C: water pollute,D: backache,E: automobile accidents, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the event being described is a common experience for people who drive cars.

"Presence," "overabundance," "stockpile," and "Mormon" do not accurately express this idea. Answer is
--target-- plentitude
--input-- Question: Where can you buy grapes directly from their growers? Options: A: grocery cart,B: kitchen,C: fridge,D: fruit market,E: super market, Knowledge: The options that are related to household items or appliances such as grocery cart, kitchen, and fridge are not plausible choices as they do not sell fruit directly from growers. Supermarket could be a plausible answer, but it is a generic term that could refer to any type of grocery store. A fruit market, on the other hand, specifically suggests a place where fruits are sold, often directly by the growers themselves. Answer is
--target-- fruit market
--input-- Question: He never took for granted living in the land of the free, for he was once a what abroad? Options: A: caged in,B: see work,C: slavery,D: topfree,E: prisoner, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned had a newfound appreciation for living in a free country, implying that they were once deprived of their freedom. The word "abroad" suggests that this experience may have happened in a foreign country, which narrows down the potential options.

--target-- prisoner
--input-- Question: Most people have what which they use to carry things? Options: A: two eyes,B: two hands,C: two arms,D: carry bags,E: ears, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people use something to carry things, which narrows the options down to "two hands" and "carry bags." However, the phrase "most people have" implies that the answer should be a natural part of the body rather than an external object. The other options, such as "two eyes," "ears," and "two arms" do not relate to carrying objects as directly as hands. Answer is
--target-- two hands
--input-- Question: Nations agreeing with each other will lead to what? Options: A: taco tuesday,B: like,C: problem,D: peace,E: contract, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when nations agree with each other, a positive outcome will result.

Additionally, the sentence suggests that the outcome will involve cooperation and harmony, which makes "peace" the most logical answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- peace
--input-- Question: If I want to keep my floor covering down, what should I put the tack in? Options: A: carpet,B: bulliten board,C: message board,D: bulletin board,E: wall, Knowledge: The phrase "keep my floor covering down" suggests that the speaker wants to secure a material to the floor. The only option that is a type of floor covering is carpet, so the tack should be put into the carpet to keep it down.

--target-- carpet

Options: A: kitchen,B: pantry,C: table,D: refrigerator,E: container, Knowledge: Condiments are typically used to enhance the flavor of food and are often placed within easy reach during meals. The kitchen and pantry are storage areas and not typically where condiments are kept while in use. The refrigerator is used to keep condiments fresh and safe to consume over a longer period of time, but they may not be easily accessible if they are chilled. A container could be used to hold condiments but is not specific to the context of the question, whereas the table is the most common location for placing condiments within reach during meals. Answer is
--target-- table
--input-- Question: Sally bought bubblegum. Where might she have gotten it? Options: A: supermarket,B: theater,C: street,D: pocket,E: church, Knowledge: The most likely place for Sally to buy bubblegum is a supermarket or grocery store.

Answer is
--target-- supermarket

Answer is
--target-- were religious
--input-- Question: What is the name of a place where cargo is stored? Options: A: at sea,B: ship's hold,C: aeroplane,D: airplane,E: boat, Knowledge: The phrase "cargo" suggests that the answer is related to transportation or storage of goods. The option "at sea" is not specific enough and could refer to any location on the water. "Aeroplane" and "airplane" are modes of transportation that are not typically associated with cargo storage. "Boat" is a general term that does not specify a type of storage location. "Ship's hold" is a specific term used to describe the lower part of a ship where cargo is stored. Answer is
--target-- ship's hold
--input-- Question: Visiting museum was an emotional experience for the old veteran, he hid it best he could but he began to what? Options: A: cry,B: whisper,C: appriciation,D: take pictures,E: feeling proud, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the visit to the museum evoked strong emotions in the old veteran, and he tried to hide it.

Options: A: posessions in,B: high walls,C: doors and windows,D: triangles,E: square shape, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the rooms in the experimental home had a feature that set them apart from traditional rooms. The use of the word "unique" suggests that this feature was unusual or unexpected. The option "square shape" makes the most sense in this context, as traditional rooms are typically square or rectangular in shape. The other options ("possessions in," "high walls," "doors and windows," and "triangles") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- square shape
--input-- Question: How does one decide if instituting a particular civil action is fair? Options: A: restitution,B: anger,C: trial,D: court case,E: confusion, Knowledge: The word "fair" suggests that a process or system is being assessed for its impartiality and justice. In civil law, a trial is a judicial proceeding in which evidence is presented, witnesses are called, and a decision is made by a judge or jury based on the facts of the case. A trial is considered a fair and impartial way to reach a decision because both sides have an opportunity to present their case, and the decision is based on the evidence presented. The other options do not relate to the idea of assessing fairness in a civil action. Answer is
--target-- trial
--input-- Question: What happens after eating dinner? Options: A: heart burn,B: become tired,C: become full,D: flatulence,E: indigestion, Knowledge: Eating dinner typically results in the feeling of being full, as the body begins to digest the food. Heartburn and indigestion may occur if the food is not properly digested, but these symptoms are not always present after eating dinner. Becoming tired may also happen after eating, but it is not a universal occurrence and thus isn't a reliable answer. Flatulence can happen, but it is not a commonly experienced effect of eating dinner. Answer is
--target-- become full
--input-- Question: What would cause a ship to stop moving? Options: A: near shore,B: a romulian space craft,C: sail on sea,D: heading east,E: run aground, Knowledge: Running aground means that a ship has hit the seabed, reef or any other underwater obstacle, causing it to stop moving forward. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. "Near shore" or "sail on sea" do not necessarily mean a ship will stop moving. "A Romulian space craft" is a reference to Star Trek and is not a realistic scenario. "Heading east" does not provide any relevant information about why a ship would stop moving. Answer is
--target-- run aground
--input-- Question: What is a train-related expression for exhaustion? Options: A: have rest,B: run out of steam,C: go to sleep,D: tuckered out,E: stay in bed, Knowledge: "Run out of steam" is a common idiomatic expression that means to become exhausted or to lose energy. This expression is often associated with trains because steam locomotives require a constant supply of steam to operate, and if the steam supply runs out, the train will stop moving. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of trains or exhaustion. Answer is
--target-- run out of steam
--input-- Question: Where would you find a lot of beds? Options: A: bedford,B: rest area,C: neighbor's house,D: hospital,E: loft, Knowledge: Hospitals are commonly associated with beds because they are used to provide a comfortable resting place for patients.

The neighbor's house and loft may have beds, but it is unlikely there would be a lot of them. Answer is
--target-- hospital
--input-- Question: What might having a check up lead to for some people? Options: A: pain,B: good behavior,C: uncertainty,D: anxiety,E: stress, Knowledge: The question implies that there may be negative consequences associated with having a medical checkup. Anxiety is a common emotional response to medical appointments, as people may be worried about their health or the possibility of receiving bad news. Pain is a possibility, but not necessarily a common outcome of a checkup, and good behavior and uncertainty do not make sense in this context. Stress is a possibility, but anxiety is a more specific and commonly associated emotion with medical checkups. Answer is
--target-- anxiety
--input-- Question: He was competing for the prestigious prize, though it had no money, what was he seeking by attempting to get it? Options: A: enemies,B: rivalry,C: bad blood,D: accomplishment,E: game, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the prize being competed for is prestigious, which implies that it is highly regarded and respected. The fact that the prize has no money suggests that it is not a financial award, but rather a recognition of achievement or excellence. The word "competing" also implies that the individual is seeking to attain something of value, which points towards accomplishment as the correct answer. The other options, such as enemies, rivalry, or bad blood, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be associated with a prestigious prize. Answer is
--target-- accomplishment
--input-- Question: The flour was stored away from the kids so they couldn't play with it, where was it? Options: A: pantry,B: grocery store,C: cupboard,D: kitchen,E: table, Knowledge: The word "stored" suggests that the flour was kept in a designated place for safekeeping. The options "grocery store" and "table" are unlikely because they suggest a public space or a communal area, whereas the sentence implies that the flour was being kept in a private household. The options "cupboard" and "kitchen" are possible but not as specific as "pantry," which is a dedicated storage space for food in many homes. Answer is
--target-- pantry
--input-- Question: The teacher explained it used a cathode ray tube like other screens, but this what measured things? Options: A: vacuum tube,B: television,C: computer,D: cathode ray,E: oscilloscope, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher is explaining a type of screen that uses a cathode ray tube, which is a type of vacuum tube commonly used in older technology. However, the sentence also specifies that this screen is used to measure things, which suggests that it is an oscilloscope, which is a device used to graphically display and analyze electronic signals. The other options, such as television and computer, do not typically use an oscilloscope for their display. Answer is
--target-- oscilloscope
--input-- Question: If a contract is not signed it will be? Options: A: rejected,B: dumb,C: written on paper,D: signed,E: revised, Knowledge: The question implies that there is a consequence for not signing a contract. Typically, if a contract is not signed, it is considered incomplete and therefore invalid. That means it can be rejected, as it lacks the necessary signature(s) to make it legally enforceable. The other options do not make sense in this context - "dumb" is slang and unrelated, "written on paper" is obvious and not a consequence, "signed" is the opposite of what is being discussed, and "revised" implies that the contract has already been changed or edited, which is not mentioned in the question. Answer is
--target-- rejected
--input-- Question: Where can you find cord along side nails and bolts? Options: A: delivery room,B: garage,C: sporting goods store,D: office,E: hardware store, Knowledge: The combination of cord, nails, and bolts suggests that this is a location where hardware or DIY supplies are sold. The delivery room, sporting goods store, and office do not typically stock these items, so they can be eliminated. The garage could be a possibility, but it is not a specific enough answer - many different types of items could be stored in a garage. Therefore, the best choice is the hardware store, as this is where one would expect to find all three of these items together. Answer is
--target-- hardware store

Options: A: diminishment,B: reduction,C: depression,D: demotion,E: disgust, Knowledge: Elevation sickness is a condition caused by exposure to high altitudes, which can cause a number of symptoms including headache, fatigue, and confusion. The word "wits" in the sentence refers to the climber's mental faculties, which may be affected by elevation sickness.

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the meaning of the word "wits." Answer is

Options: A: falling asleep,B: entertainment,C: scared him,D: headache,E: seizure, Knowledge: The sentence mentions flashing lights causing something bad to happen to James.

Options: A: have money,B: sleep,C: bring flowers,D: go to market,E: get money, Knowledge: Shopping involves purchasing goods or services, which requires a form of payment. Money is the most commonly used method of payment, which is why it is necessary for someone to have money in order to shop.

"Get money" could be a possible answer, but it is less specific than "have money" and doesn't clarify from where the money should come. Answer is
--target-- have money

Options: A: manipulate,B: show affection,C: companion,D: seperate,E: electrical circuit, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of greeting with a kiss is a way to do something simple.

--target-- show affection
--input-- Question: There was a dog, it was barking loudly.  James wasn't scared of it though, because it was confined.  Where might it have been confined to? Options: A: backyard,B: kitchen cupboard,C: front door,D: table,E: park, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the dog was barking loudly, but James was not scared because it was confined. The most likely place for a dog to be confined would be a backyard since it allows the dog some room to move around while still being enclosed. The other options - kitchen cupboard, front door, table, and park - do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not provide a suitable place for a dog to be confined. Answer is
--target-- backyard
--input-- Question: The magician guessed it was a king, he was very good with a what? Options: A: hierarchy,B: court,C: chess game,D: deck of cards,E: chess set, Knowledge: The context suggests that the magician was able to make a guess about the identity of something or someone based on his skills. The choices "hierarchy" and "court" are less likely to be linked to such a guess. Additionally, the term "game" is used twice in the sentence, suggesting that the answer may be related to a game. The options "chess game" and "chess set" are related to chess, but the magician may not necessarily have been good at chess. Thus, the most appropriate option would be "deck of cards" as this is a game commonly associated with magicians and guessing games. Answer is
--target-- deck of cards
--input-- Question: If you see cars with a light blinking on the driver's side what does that indicate they will do? Options: A: slow down,B: go forward,C: get to town,D: turn left,E: turn right, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the blinking light is located on the driver's side of the car, which is typically where the turn signal is located. The options "slow down," "go forward," and "get to town" do not make sense as they do not involve the use of a turn signal. The remaining options, "turn left" and "turn right," both involve the use of a turn signal, but the position of the blinking light on the driver's side suggests that the driver intends to turn left. Answer is
--target-- turn left

--input-- Question: When not in a city where would expect to see a bald eagle? Options: A: painting,B: aviary,C: rural area,D: zoo,E: colorado, Knowledge: Bald eagles are known to live in areas with access to bodies of water, as they primarily feed on fish. Rural areas can offer ample access to both water and undisturbed natural habitats, making them a more likely location to spot a wild bald eagle. The other options, such as painting, zoo, and aviary, do not offer live views of a bald eagle in a natural setting. While it is possible to see bald eagles in Colorado, the question does not provide any specific location or context, so it would be safer to choose the general answer of "rural area." Answer is

Options: A: kid's house,B: studio,C: large house,D: house in england,E: mansion, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the drawing room was one of fifty rooms, which suggests that it was located in a large house rather than a smaller residence such as a kid's house or a studio.

Answer is
--target-- large house

Options: A: throw up,B: food,C: coffee,D: stumble,E: food, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is watching his calorie intake, which means he likely wants to reduce his overall consumption of calories. Since the drink was very sweet, it probably contained a lot of sugar or other sweeteners that can contribute significantly to one's daily caloric intake. In order to offset this, John may want to consume less food overall to keep his calorie count in check. The other options, such as throwing up or stumbling, do not logically connect to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- food

However, despite its name, "lead" is not actually used in pencils anymore due to its toxicity. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "lead pencil" since it reflects the common usage of graphite in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- lead pencil
--input-- Question: Where would you go to see a sword? Options: A: container called scabbard,B: school,C: collection,D: museum,E: sheath, Knowledge: A sword is a type of weapon or tool that is typically displayed in museums or collections.

Therefore, the correct answer is museum. Answer is
--target-- museum

Options: A: record player,B: palm pilot,C: hand,D: ink,E: fridge, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person enjoys listening to music and is particular about the quality of sound. The term "audiophile" refers to someone who is passionate about high-quality sound reproduction.

--target-- tropics
--input-- Question: What does everyone try their whole life to be? Options: A: sad,B: happy,C: grow old,D: cat,E: believed, Knowledge: The question asks what everyone tries their whole life to be. This suggests that the answer is a universal goal or desire. We can eliminate options like "sad" and "cat" because they are not something people actively strive for. "Grow old" is a natural process that happens to everyone, but not necessarily something they try to achieve. "Believed" does not make sense in this context. This leaves us with "happy," which is a common goal for people, suggesting that it is the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- happy
--input-- Question: What causes meeting people to be preceded by meditation? Options: A: being bored,B: panic attack,C: anxiety,D: making new friends,E: love, Knowledge: The word "preceded" suggests that the act of meditation comes before meeting people, indicating that it is done to prepare for the social interaction. The context suggests that this preparation is due to a negative feeling or state, and the option "anxiety" is commonly linked to social anxiety, which can lead someone to feel overwhelmed by social interactions. The other options, such as "love" or "making new friends," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- anxiety
--input-- Question: Where would you go to argue about important bills? Options: A: mail box,B: the post office,C: congress,D: restaurant,E: trash, Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the question is related to governmental proceedings.

Options: A: supermarket,B: grocery store,C: walmart,D: church,E: bathroom, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lady needs to buy a lot of items and has limited time, so she needs to go to a place where she can find many things in one location. Supermarkets are known for offering a wide variety of items, including groceries, household goods, and personal care products, all in one place, making them a convenient option for someone with limited time. The other options do not fit the criteria of offering a wide variety of items in one location. Answer is

Options: A: icy cold,B: own home,C: garage,D: freeze food,E: appliance store, Knowledge: The question is asking where to obtain a freezer, which implies that the person currently does not have one. The options "icy cold," "own home," and "garage" do not make sense as places to obtain a freezer.

Answer is
--target-- appliance store
--input-- Question: The first or second floor is the safest from fire when you sleep where away from home?

Answer is
--target-- neighbor's house
--input-- Question: What happens when friends observe something at the same time? Options: A: travel together,B: borrow money,C: conspire,D: visit each other,E: see like, Knowledge: The word "observe" in the sentence suggests that the friends are looking at something together, and the phrase "at the same time" suggests that they are seeing the same thing.

Options: A: home,B: airport,C: skyscraper,D: castle,E: every building, Knowledge: Castles are known for their large wooden doors, which were often reinforced with iron or other sturdy materials to protect against invaders. While some homes may have large wooden doors, it is less common than in castles. Airports and skyscrapers typically have automatic sliding doors or revolving doors made of glass or metal, and not wooden doors. "Every building" is too broad of a category and cannot be inferred from the question. Answer is

--input-- Question: What is the best course of action for a person to take if they want to get up early? Options: A: go to bed early,B: fix up alarm,C: go sleep early,D: dawn,E: ask spouse to wake, Knowledge: Getting up early requires going to bed early as well so that the body can have enough rest and energy for the day ahead. Fixing an alarm can only remind a person to wake up, but it does not guarantee that they will have the energy to start their day. "Go sleep early" is not a grammatically correct option, and "dawn" is not a practical solution as it is not an action that a person can take. Asking a spouse to wake a person up can put unnecessary pressure on the spouse and may not be reliable. Therefore, the best course of action for a person to take if they want to get up early is to go to bed early. Answer is
--target-- go to bed early
--input-- Question: Art, playing music, and other hobbies are great ways of expressing yourself that can be great what?

Answer is

Options: A: adequate,B: poormouth,C: rich,D: enough,E: good, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the living conditions in the building were not great, but it also suggests that the building did meet minimum standards for habitation. The word "barely" indicates that the building met only the most basic requirements for safety and functionality. The word "adequate" means sufficient for a given purpose or need, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options either contradict the context of the sentence or are irrelevant. Answer is
--target-- adequate
--input-- Question: Where can you buy clothing, sporting goods, and housewares? Options: A: backpack,B: house,C: department store,D: mall,E: table, Knowledge: The items listed in the question are commonly found in a department store, which typically sells a wide variety of products under one roof.

--target-- department store
--input-- Question: Where can you take your kids to buy things for them to play with? Options: A: disneyland,B: jungle,C: swimming pool,D: toy store,E: home, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a place to buy toys for their kids to play with. Disneyland and the jungle are not typically associated with buying toys, while a swimming pool is a place to swim rather than buy toys. Home is also an unlikely option as the sentence implies that the speaker wants to take their kids somewhere to buy toys. A toy store is therefore the correct answer as it is the most logical choice for buying toys. Answer is
--target-- toy store

Satisfaction and aggravation are unlikely outcomes of a program that did not work as intended. Answer is
--target-- frustration
--input-- Question: Where is a flute likely to be in a pit? Options: A: party,B: orchestra,C: musical instrument store,D: marching band,E: symphony, Knowledge: The term "pit" commonly refers to the area in front of a stage where the orchestra is situated. It is where musicians play music for plays, operas, and musicals that require live instrumental accompaniment.

Swiss cheese and golf courses do not have solid surfaces that someone could make a hole in with their fist.

A wall, however, is a solid surface that someone could make a hole in with their fist. Answer is

Options: A: sleep,B: sit down,C: go to bed,D: run,E: closing eyes, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is already standing or walking, and their legs are tired. Sleeping or going to bed are not appropriate options as they are not practical in the moment. Running would only make the situation worse. Closing eyes is not mentioned in the context of the sentence and cannot be assumed to be a solution to tired legs. Sitting down is the most appropriate option as it will allow the person to rest their legs and take a break from standing or walking. Answer is
--target-- sit down
--input-- Question: What happens to most people after playing tennis all day? Options: A: championship,B: becoming tired,C: tennis elbow,D: victory,E: friends, Knowledge: The sentence implies that playing tennis all day results in a physical activity that causes exhaustion.

The other options do not address the physical toll that playing tennis all day would have on a person's body. Answer is
--target-- becoming tired

The man got up early to do something, which suggests that it was morning and he was starting his day.

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- eat breakfast

Options: A: drinking,B: playing poker,C: sit,D: talk,E: being greedy, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a common act of consumption that people engage in while having food, which indicates that the answer should be related to food or beverages.

The context of the sentence involves murder, which is a violent and traumatic experience that can cause great emotional pain and suffering. The other options, except for "terrible," which is a vague adjective that does not clearly indicate an emotion or feeling, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Remorse" refers to a feeling of guilt or regret, "retaliation" refers to taking revenge or seeking justice, and "wet" is a physical sensation that does not relate to the emotional state of the family members. Answer is

Options: A: groundhog,B: construction site,C: landmine,D: army,E: fireworks display, Knowledge: Independence Day is commonly associated with fireworks displays as a way to celebrate the national holiday.

--input-- Question: What do you do to make sure that you are remembering? Options: A: bad time,B: closing eyes,C: answering question,D: stopping to think,E: forgetting, Knowledge: The question is asking about a strategy to ensure that one is remembering something, which suggests that the other options are unlikely to be effective. Closing one's eyes and answering a question are not necessarily related to memory, while "bad time" and "forgetting" are not strategies at all. "Stopping to think" is a common technique for recalling information, as it allows one to focus their attention and retrieve relevant details from their memory. Answer is
--target-- stopping to think
--input-- Question: Where can I drink beer or any other alcoholic beverage? Options: A: bar,B: vending machine,C: bottle,D: refrigerator,E: hockey game, Knowledge: Bars are commonly associated with serving alcoholic beverages, while vending machines, bottles, refrigerators, and hockey games do not necessarily have any connection to alcohol consumption. While some venues, like hockey games, may offer beer for sale, they are not solely focused on serving alcohol in the same way that bars are. Answer is
--target-- bar
--input-- Question: After killing people in a rage what is someone likely to feel? Options: A: stomach ache,B: retaliation,C: sadness,D: remorse,E: going to jail, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has killed people in a state of anger or fury, which commonly leads to feelings of guilt or regret after the violent act is committed. Remorse, which means deep regret or guilt for a wrong committed, is the most appropriate choice among the options considering the context of the sentence. Stomach ache and retaliation do not make logical sense in this context, while sadness is not a strong enough emotion to describe the severity of the situation. Going to jail is a consequence of the action and not a feeling. Answer is
--target-- remorse
--input-- Question: Who is likely to use too much salt? Options: A: shaker,B: fast food restaurant,C: kitchen cupboard,D: people,E: table, Knowledge: The question suggests that someone or something may be using too much salt, and the options given each represent a possible culprit. A shaker or kitchen cupboard may be used by individuals who have control over the amount of salt they add to their food, making it unlikely that they would use too much. "People" is too broad and does not provide specific information. A table is an inanimate object and cannot use salt. A fast food restaurant, however, is known for using high amounts of salt in their food to enhance flavor and preserve freshness, making it the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- fast food restaurant
--input-- Question: What did the friendly man do when meeting knew people to show he was happy? Options: A: say hello,B: start a conversation,C: introducing yourself,D: shake hands,E: smiling, Knowledge: The question suggests that the friendly man did something specific to show that he was happy when meeting new people. Out of the given choices, the act of smiling is most commonly associated with expressing happiness and friendliness when meeting someone new. While saying hello, starting a conversation, and shaking hands are all common social interactions, they do not necessarily indicate happiness on their own. Introducing oneself is also a common social norm, but it does not necessarily suggest a person's level of happiness. Answer is
--target-- smiling
--input-- Question: Where does the sun set? Options: A: outer space,B: horizon,C: beach,D: west,E: beans, Knowledge: The sun sets in the west, which is a well-known fact based on the direction of the earth's rotation and the position of the sun in relation to the horizon.

Options: A: frost bite,B: broken bones,C: chapped lips,D: healthy body,E: broken legs, Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is related to injuries sustained in a skiing accident, and broken bones are a common injury in such accidents. Frost bite and chapped lips are possible consequences of prolonged exposure to cold weather, but they may not necessarily be present in multiple places. A healthy body is not an injury, and broken legs are not necessarily present in more than one place. Answer is
--target-- broken bones
--input-- Question: John tried his best to care for Kate, but Kate kept throwing herself into danger.  He couldn't stand her what for her own safety? Options: A: unfeeling,B: disregard,C: indifferent,D: neglect,E: apathetic, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite John's efforts to care for Kate, she repeatedly put herself in danger. The word that fits best in the blank should convey a lack of concern for her own safety, which is indicated by the fact that she kept putting herself in harm's way. The options "neglect" and "apathetic" also convey a lack of care, but "disregard" is a better fit in the context of the sentence. The options "unfeeling" and "indifferent" do not necessarily imply a lack of concern for safety, and so are not the best choices. Answer is
--target-- disregard
--input-- Question: The agent of change had a loath feeling for the king, he would set for a plan to have him what? Options: A: recycled,B: inclined,C: disposed,D: avid,E: enthusiastic, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the agent of change has a negative feeling towards the king and is planning to do something to him. "Disposed" means to get rid of something or someone, which fits the context of the sentence indicating that the agent of change is planning to get rid of the king. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- disposed
--input-- Question: A poet may need to go where to achieve learning as an adult? Options: A: classroom,B: english class,C: university,D: book store,E: home, Knowledge: The phrase "achieve learning as an adult" implies that the poet is seeking higher education or advanced learning opportunities. While it's possible to learn outside of a university setting, the other options given (classroom, English class, book store, and home) do not necessarily suggest a formal, structured environment suited for adult learners. Additionally, universities are well-known for offering a variety of programs and courses that can accommodate different interests and goals. Answer is
--target-- university
--input-- Question: Where would a kitchen towel be found? Options: A: cupboard,B: at hotel,C: linen closet,D: under a rock,E: locker room, Knowledge: Kitchen towels are commonly used in the kitchen for a variety of purposes such as drying dishes and wiping countertops. Therefore, it is more likely that it would be found in a location that is easily accessible from the kitchen, such as a cupboard or a drawer. The other options, such as hotel, linen closet, under a rock, or locker room, do not have any direct relevance to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- cupboard
--input-- Question: Answering questions followed by saying, "sir" or "ma'am" is an indication that you are what? Options: A: irritation,B: correct,C: responding,D: polite,E: sadness, Knowledge: The use of "sir" or "ma'am" after answering a question is a common sign of respect and formality, suggesting that the speaker is being courteous and well-mannered. The other options (irritation, correct, responding, sadness) do not align with this type of behavior and are therefore unlikely to be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- polite
--input-- Question: Matt had issues controlling his anger, what did he do when someone set him off? Options: A: destroy enemy,B: punch,C: cool off,D: write letter,E: illustrate point, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Matt had difficulty controlling his anger, which implies that he may have had a physical reaction when someone triggered him. Punching someone is a common physical response when someone is angry and feels out of control. The other options do not align with this context - destroying an enemy, writing letters, and illustrating points are all more strategic or intellectual responses rather than physical ones. Cooling off is a more neutral option, but it doesn't necessarily suggest any action or behavior on Matt's part. Answer is
--target-- punch
--input-- Question: When two people are doing the same thing, what do they tend to do? Options: A: read stories,B: compete,C: help,D: solve problems,E: give orders, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when two people are doing the same thing, they tend to compete.

The other options, such as helping or giving orders, do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- compete
--input-- Question: After checking in at the ticket office the couple entered their prom in the school's what? Options: A: movie theaters,B: end of line,C: football field,D: auditorium,E: opera house, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the couple entered their "prom," which is a school dance typically held indoors. The options "movie theaters," "end of line," "football field," and "opera house" are all outdoor venues or places that do not typically host school dances. "Auditorium" is the most fitting option as it is commonly used as a venue for school events such as dances, concerts, and theater performances. Answer is
--target-- auditorium
--input-- Question: The hipsters tried to take a disingenuous kooky approach to their cafe, they were soon out of business to the competitor who took what kind of approach? Options: A: mainstream,B: straight,C: right,D: conventional,E: uneccentric, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hipsters took a disingenuous and kooky approach to their cafe, which implies that they were trying to be different or unique in a forced or insincere way. This approach may have alienated potential customers or made it difficult for them to understand what the cafe was all about. The sentence also suggests that the competitor took a different approach that allowed them to succeed, and since the other choices all suggest some form of alignment with the hipster approach, the correct answer is conventional, which suggests a more straightforward and traditional approach that is more likely to appeal to a wider range of customers. Answer is
--target-- conventional
--input-- Question: Where is a ballpoint pen best stored? Options: A: pocket,B: stationery store,C: backpack,D: desk drawer,E: bank, Knowledge: The question is asking for the best place to store a ballpoint pen, which implies that it is a long-term storage location rather than a temporary one. The other answer choices don't seem like logical locations for long-term storage of a pen. A pocket could lead to loss or damage, a stationery store is where one would buy the pen, a backpack is a transportation method, and a bank has no clear connection to pen storage. Therefore, a desk drawer, where one would store office supplies, seems to be the most appropriate choice. Answer is
--target-- desk drawer
--input-- Question: If you cut when waiting at the ticket office, what should your punishment be? Options: A: auditorium,B: humans,C: opera house,D: death,E: end of line, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that cutting in line at the ticket office is unacceptable and may result in a punishment.

Options: A: awards ceremony,B: various situations,C: vocation,D: working hard,E: promotion, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that success is achieved through preparation and some other factor, which is likely to be related to putting in effort or hard work.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and are not commonly recognized as factors in success. Answer is
--target-- working hard
--input-- Question: The key to happiness while living life is to do more than what? Options: A: existing,B: happiness,C: early death,D: acquiring knowledge,E: being idle, Knowledge: The question is asking for the opposite of the key to happiness while living life.

The other options (happiness, early death, acquiring knowledge, being idle) do not provide a clear opposite to the key to happiness. Answer is
--target-- existing
--input-- Question: He had said he would cook dinner, but first he needed to what? Options: A: hungry,B: buy a kitchen,C: buy food,D: buy groceries,E: eat food, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to purchase something before they can cook dinner. This implies that they do not have the ingredients they need, so they must go out and buy them. The option "buy a kitchen" is unlikely, as it does not make sense to buy a new kitchen in order to cook dinner. The option "hungry" is incorrect, as it is unlikely that someone would need to be hungry to cook dinner. The options "buy food" and "eat food" are also incorrect, as they suggest that the person already has food but must either purchase or consume it. Answer is
--target-- buy groceries
--input-- Question: If I go to a bank to get money, where could I go next to get household items and food? Options: A: city,B: financial center,C: main street,D: grocery store,E: salon, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after getting money from a bank, the next location would be one where household items and food can be purchased. A grocery store is the most likely option as it offers a wide variety of food and household essentials. The other options (city, financial center, main street, salon) do not necessarily have anything to do with purchasing household items and food. Answer is
--target-- grocery store
--input-- Question: If someone is free from guilt what are they likely to achieve? Options: A: peaceful sleep,B: freedom from want,C: medal,D: headache,E: new computer, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being free from guilt can have a positive effect on a person's well-being. Guilt can create feelings of anxiety and unrest, which may impact a person's ability to sleep peacefully. Therefore, it is likely that if someone is free from guilt, they are more likely to achieve peaceful sleep. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- peaceful sleep
--input-- Question: Danny hasn't experienced all that it means to be human yet.  He is missing something important.  What might he be missing? Options: A: space shuttle,B: library,C: school,D: love,E: wife, Knowledge: The sentence implies that Danny has not fully experienced what it means to be human, which suggests that he may be missing an emotional or interpersonal element. The option "love" fits this description, as it is a fundamental human emotion that is often seen as a defining characteristic of the human experience. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- love

Options: A: make love,B: when they hug,C: shake hands,D: agree with each other,E: work together, Knowledge: The question is asking for a term that describes when two people have the same point of view. "Agree with each other" is the only option that directly reflects this meaning. "Make love" and "when they hug" are unrelated to having the same point of view, while "shake hands" and "work together" may indicate a level of cooperation, but not necessarily a shared perspective. Answer is
--target-- agree with each other
--input-- Question: Where might people gather while they are waiting for a ride across town? Options: A: wedding,B: bus stop,C: convention,D: pool,E: apartment, Knowledge: The question suggests that people are waiting for a ride across town, which is most commonly associated with public transportation.

--target-- bus stop

Options: A: real estate,B: treasure chest,C: stock market,D: business,E: bank, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person wants to make money by selling houses, which is a key area of focus within the field of real estate.

The other options listed are not directly related to the real estate industry and would not provide the necessary knowledge to sell houses. Answer is
--target-- real estate

Options: A: on trial,B: drink coffee,C: believe in god,D: baptise,E: say mass, Knowledge: Priests are commonly associated with performing religious rituals or ceremonies, such as saying mass or baptising individuals. The context of the sentence suggests that the priest is in front of a gathering of people, which may indicate that he is performing a public ceremony.

--target-- say mass
--input-- Question: What can you do while driving to work that involves sound but does not require you to move your mouth? Options: A: anger,B: listen to radio,C: speed,D: sing,E: statue, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity must involve sound but not require movement of the mouth while driving to work. Anger and speed are not activities that involve sound, while singing requires movement of the mouth. A statue is a stationary object and not an activity. Therefore, the correct answer is listening to the radio, as it involves hearing sounds but does not require movement of the mouth. Answer is
--target-- listen to radio
--input-- Question: What form of government is most associated with kingdoms? Options: A: monarchy,B: ruled by government,C: europe,D: book,E: king, Knowledge: A monarchy is a form of government where a king or queen serves as the head of state. The term "kingdom" suggests a country or territory that is ruled by a monarch, making monarchy the most closely associated form of government. "Ruled by government" is too broad and could apply to various forms of government, while "Europe" is a continent and not a form of government. "Book" is not related to the question at all. Answer is
--target-- monarchy
--input-- Question: Manny refused to give the court respect, and was charged with what? Options: A: dishonor,B: contempt,C: humiliate,D: disdain,E: scorn, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Manny did not show respect to the court, which would be considered disrespectful and disobedient behavior. The term "contempt" specifically refers to actions that show disrespect or disregard for the authority of a court or similar institution. The other options, such as dishonor or humiliate, do not accurately reflect the legal consequences of disrespecting a court. Answer is

Options: A: commercial,B: three toed,C: civil service,D: paraguay,E: costa rica, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the man was convicted of a crime related to his lack of motivation or effort, which may imply that he may have been employed in a job that requires him to be active and productive, such as a civil servant.

Options: A: legs,B: chair,C: laziness,D: floor,E: sit on, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people were actively trying to make themselves comfortable by sitting down, which implies the use of some type of seating. The option "legs" is incorrect because it is not something that is required for sitting down comfortably. "Laziness" is not relevant to the context of the sentence. "Floor" is incorrect because it is not necessarily comfortable to sit on the floor. "Sit on" is also incorrect because it is not a specific object or item that can provide comfort. Answer is
--target-- chair
--input-- Question: The dog loved to run after ball, it would do it over and over until it would what? Options: A: get tired,B: ball stopped,C: fall and hurt yourself,D: breathe,E: catching, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog has a lot of energy and enjoys chasing after a ball repeatedly. The phrase "over and over" implies that the dog does this for a long period of time, suggesting that eventually, it will become tired. The other options, such as "ball stopped" and "fall and hurt yourself," do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Breathing" is a natural process and doesn't have any clear connection to the dog's activity, while "catching" is already implied in the first part of the sentence (i.e. the dog loves to run after the ball). Answer is
--target-- get tired
--input-- Question: Where can a human relax? Options: A: workplace,B: park,C: church,D: war zone,E: jail, Knowledge: Parks are commonly associated with relaxation and leisure activities, such as picnics, walks, and spending time in nature. In contrast, workplaces, war zones, and jails are typically associated with stress, danger, and confinement, which are not conducive to relaxation.

--target-- park

Options: A: room temperature,B: thin blood,C: make parks,D: take several forms,E: move mountains, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that large amounts of water can cause significant changes over an extended period of time. Mountains are known to be shaped by the erosive forces of water, which is why the option "move mountains" is the most appropriate choice.

--target-- move mountains

Options: A: get drunk,B: meet new people,C: drinking beer,D: enjoy yourself,E: having sex, Knowledge: The question implies that going to a party with the opposite sex can have certain consequences, and the choices suggest different possibilities. Out of those options, having sex is most commonly associated with parties where alcohol is consumed and people are in close proximity to each other. While it is possible to meet new people, drink beer, and enjoy oneself at a party, those options do not necessarily lead to the same consequences as going to a party with the opposite sex. Answer is
--target-- having sex
--input-- Question: Where would children go to see different animals? Options: A: school,B: zoo,C: soccer game,D: disneyland,E: cricket stadium, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that children are going somewhere to see different animals. The most common place to see a variety of animals in one location is at a zoo. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence.

--target-- zoo

The term "feminist" does not apply to mythological figures in this way, and is therefore an unlikely choice for the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- gods
--input-- Question: Why would you stop chatting with friends? Options: A: learning about,B: meeting,C: misunderstanding,D: laughter,E: silliness, Knowledge: The question asks for a reason to stop chatting with friends, and one of the options is misunderstanding.

Options: A: avoid eye contact,B: feel guilty,C: blush,D: turn purple,E: fall asleep, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John has a negative emotional response to lying. Feeling guilty is a common psychological response to dishonesty, as it goes against moral values and ethics. Avoiding eye contact and blushing may also be associated with lying, but they are not necessarily correlated with the particular emotional response of guilt. Turning purple and falling asleep are not logical or expected outcomes of lying. Answer is
--target-- feel guilty
--input-- Question: If competing with others what emotion is useful for getting an advantage?

Options: A: fox theater,B: theater district,C: ballpark,D: theatre,E: counseling, Knowledge: A well-dressed person visiting a box office suggests that they are going to attend a formal event. The options of "fox theater" or "theatre district" indicate locations that are known for hosting theatrical performances, and therefore are likely a correct answer.

--target-- theatre
--input-- Question: What does someone gain from getting divorce? Options: A: poorer,B: sadness,C: depression,D: tears,E: freedom, Knowledge: Divorce often represents the end of a relationship that may have been confining or unhappy, so the person who is getting divorced may feel a sense of liberation or freedom.

Options: A: fair,B: false start,C: competitive,D: in competition,E: practice, Knowledge: The sentence is asking about what you compete against someone in, which indicates that there is a specific event or activity being referred to. "Fair" and "false start" are not things that you compete against someone in. "Competitive" is an adjective that describes the nature of the activity, rather than the actual event being competed in. "Practice" is a way to prepare for a competition, but it is not the competition itself. Therefore, "in competition" is the most appropriate answer. Answer is
--target-- in competition

Options: A: new perspectives,B: knowledge,C: sense,D: best way,E: figure out, Knowledge: The question suggests that the key to doing things in a new way is to change the way one thinks about the task at hand. This implies that new perspectives are necessary to generate new ideas and approaches. Knowledge and sense might be helpful in some cases, but they don't necessarily lead to new ways of doing things. "Best way" and "figure out" both imply using existing methods or knowledge to solve a problem, which doesn't necessarily lead to innovation or creativity. Answer is
--target-- new perspectives
--input-- Question: What is a good way to get food hot? Options: A: fridge,B: field,C: oven,D: table,E: cupboard, Knowledge: The other options listed do not make sense in the context of the question.

Options: A: tiredness,B: passing out,C: death,D: exhaustion,E: heartbreak, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that running twenty six miles could have a dangerous consequence for someone with an underlying heart condition. Death is a severe but possible outcome in such a case. Tiredness and exhaustion may be expected outcomes for anyone who runs a marathon, but the sentence specifies an underlying heart condition, which indicates that the risks are higher for this person. Passing out and heartbreak are not relevant to the question's context. Answer is
--target-- death
--input-- Question: Where would you get some tin if you do not have any? Options: A: cupboard,B: hardware store,C: antique store,D: shop,E: grocery store, Knowledge: Tin is a metal commonly used for making various household items like kitchenware and cans.

The best option for obtaining tin would be a hardware store where metals and tools are sold. Answer is
--target-- hardware store

The security guard allows him to do something to pass the time, but the context of the sentence indicates that it is a relatively physical activity. "Grind" is a term commonly used in skateboarding when a skateboarder slides down a rail or edge of a surface. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "skateboard," as it is the only option that fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not involve physical activity, and some, like "meet interesting people" or "listen to music," are less likely to be allowed by a security guard in a particular environment. Answer is
--target-- skateboard
--input-- Question: Where does a person use an expressway to get around quickly? Options: A: medium,B: country,C: eastern united states,D: american city,E: michigan, Knowledge: Expressways are typically found in urban areas where there is a high volume of traffic and a need to move vehicles quickly through the city. This eliminates options such as medium and country, which do not have a large number of expressways. Eastern United States and Michigan are too broad and do not provide enough specific information to answer the question. Therefore, the correct answer is American city. Answer is
--target-- american city
--input-- Question: What is a computer user using Zillow have as a goal? Options: A: house,B: hell,C: office building,D: own home,E: car, Knowledge: Zillow is a real estate website used by people who are looking to buy or rent a home. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a computer user using Zillow has the goal of finding a new place to live, which could include purchasing or renting a house or apartment. The other options, such as "hell" or "office building", do not align with the purpose of using a real estate website like Zillow. Answer is
--target-- own home
--input-- Question: Where could you have fun with lots of people around you? Options: A: good,B: friend's house,C: fairgrounds,D: watching television,E: expensive, Knowledge: The phrase "lots of people around you" suggests a social setting with a large crowd, which is commonly found at fairgrounds where people gather for fun, food, and games. The other options do not have any clear connection to a social setting with lots of people. "Good" is too vague without any context and "friend's house" may or may not have a large number of people depending on the situation. "Watching television" and "expensive" are unlikely to provide a social atmosphere with a large crowd. Answer is
--target-- fairgrounds
--input-- Question: What does every person talk out of? Options: A: name,B: hide,C: mother and father,D: mouth,E: heart, Knowledge: The question is asking for the body part that every person uses to talk.

--target-- mouth
--input-- Question: There are many sayings and metaphors about flirting, which one could be found in a machine shop? Options: A: feelings,B: sexual excitement,C: sparks fly,D: problems,E: unwanted pregnancy, Knowledge: "Sparks fly" is a common metaphor used to describe a strong and immediate attraction between two people. In a machine shop, sparks are often produced during the process of cutting or welding metal, so the use of this metaphor would connect to the environment and suggest a strong and intense attraction. The other choices are not commonly associated with flirting or the context of a machine shop. Answer is
--target-- sparks fly
--input-- Question: When a person is living on the streets they likely what? Options: A: shameful,B: ridiculous,C: lazy,D: restricted,E: have no home, Knowledge: The phrase "living on the streets" implies that the person is homeless and does not have a permanent residence. The other options do not accurately describe the situation of being homeless. The word "shameful" implies a sense of wrongdoing, which is not necessarily applicable to the situation of being homeless. "Ridiculous" and "lazy" are judgmental and insensitive terms that do not reflect the complex realities of homelessness. "Restricted" does not accurately describe the lack of a permanent home. Answer is
--target-- have no home
--input-- Question: Bill's horse escaped it's paddock and ran away to some place it could be free. Where might it have gone? Options: A: canada,B: circus,C: movies,D: countryside,E: parade, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the horse escaped to a place where it could roam freely, which is commonly associated with the countryside. Horses are often kept in paddocks or stables in urban or suburban areas and may not have access to the open space and freedom they require. The other options are not as likely as countryside to provide the open space the horse needs. Answer is
--target-- countryside
--input-- Question: Where is a good place for a woman to store her sunglasses? Options: A: drugstore,B: movie theater,C: bag,D: shirt pocket,E: purse, Knowledge: The question implies that a woman wants to keep her sunglasses with her and not lose them. A purse is a commonly used accessory to carry personal items, including sunglasses. The other options (drugstore, movie theater, shirt pocket) are not appropriate places to store sunglasses as they do not offer protection or easy access. A bag could be a viable option but it is not clear what kind of bag is being referred to. Answer is
--target-- purse
--input-- Question: What negative thing might someone experience if they spend time learning about a subject that is very complex and difficult? Options: A: headache,B: gain knowledge,C: elation,D: advance,E: aids, Knowledge: The question implies that learning about a complex and difficult subject could have a negative impact on someone. It's possible that the person could experience frustration or feel overwhelmed, but the most likely answer is a headache. Learning new information and processing complicated concepts can be mentally exhausting, which could lead to physical discomfort. The other options do not make logical sense as negative side effects of learning about a difficult subject. Answer is
--target-- headache
--input-- Question: The aging rockstar had to finally stop playing guitar, his hands just wouldn't cooperate because of the what? Options: A: singing,B: arthritis,C: listening to music,D: making music,E: playing music, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the aging rockstar had to stop playing guitar due to a physical condition affecting their hands. Arthritis is a common condition that affects joint mobility and could make it difficult for anyone, including a musician, to play an instrument. The other choices do not relate to a physical condition that would affect a musician's ability to play an instrument. Answer is
--target-- arthritis
--input-- Question: What is a positive feeling that you might get after going jogging? Options: A: heart rate increases,B: heart attacks,C: sweating,D: sore feet,E: feel pride, Knowledge: Jogging is a form of exercise that is generally associated with positive health benefits. It is common to feel a sense of accomplishment and pride after completing a jog, as it is a challenging physical activity that requires discipline and effort. The other options are all negative outcomes that are not typically associated with jogging, such as heart attacks and sore feet. Answer is
--target-- feel pride
--input-- Question: What does a performer stand on? Options: A: dance,B: opera,C: see saw,D: stage,E: party, Knowledge: A performer typically stands on a stage during a performance, whether it is a play, musical, or dance. The other options, such as see saw and party, do not typically involve a performer standing or performing on something specific. Opera is also performed on a stage, but the question is asking about what a performer stands on, which is more closely associated with theater performances. Answer is
--target-- stage
--input-- Question: The car was out in the sun all day, what happened to the interior? Options: A: set off,B: melted,C: heat up,D: back up,E: red, Knowledge: When a car is left in the sun for an extended period of time, the interior of the car can become very hot due to the heat. This can cause the temperature to rise and make the interior uncomfortable for passengers to sit in. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- heat up
--input-- Question: Light, games, and music are part of what celebration? Options: A: concert,B: found at disco,C: plane,D: carnival,E: christmas, Knowledge: The words "light," "games," and "music" are often associated with carnivals, which are festive events that usually involve parades, amusement rides, and street performances. Concerts and discos may involve music and light, but they do not typically involve games. Planes are unrelated to celebrations and do not fit the context of the sentence. Christmas may involve lights and music, but it does not typically involve games in the way that carnivals do. Answer is
--target-- carnival
--input-- Question: Where is a market likely to be enclosed? Options: A: field,B: village,C: rural area,D: city,E: mexico, Knowledge: Enclosed markets are typically found in urban or city areas where there is limited space and a high concentration of people. In contrast, fields and rural areas are more likely to have open-air markets, and villages may have a mix of both. Mexico is a country and therefore is not a likely location for an enclosed market without specifying a city or region. Answer is
--target-- city
--input-- Question: He watched the team play every Sunday, but this was the first time the fan would enter a what to see a snap live? Options: A: football stadium,B: hot room,C: hockey game,D: living room,E: basketball court, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the fan has been watching the team play on Sundays, suggesting that the team likely plays a sport that is typically played on Sundays, such as football. The sentence also mentions the fan seeing a snap "live," which implies that they will be physically present at the game, ruling out options like a living room where they might watch a game on television. Finally, the phrase "enter a" suggests that they will be entering a specific space, further supporting the idea that the answer is a football stadium rather than a general location like a basketball court. Answer is
--target-- football stadium
--input-- Question: Where would you not be able to find a radio studio? Options: A: office building,B: college,C: broadcasting music,D: large city,E: clear area, Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where a radio studio would not be found. An office building or college may have a radio studio as part of their communication or media departments. Broadcasting music could refer to a radio station, which would obviously have a radio studio. Large cities are likely to have multiple radio stations, each with their own studio. However, a clear area does not suggest any kind of building or infrastructure, making it the unlikely option where a radio studio could be found. Answer is
--target-- clear area
--input-- Question: As the round object rolls down the ramp it will what? Options: A: sound well,B: fly,C: become broken,D: gain speed,E: fall into hole, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the round object is rolling down a ramp, and the question asks what will happen to it. One common physical phenomenon associated with a rolling object on a slope is that it gains speed as it moves downhill due to gravity. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- gain speed
--input-- Question: He would entertain with a pool party regularly, it was the best way to beat the what? Options: A: please,B: hot,C: guest,D: bribe,E: liked, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the pool party was a way to "beat" something, suggesting that it was a solution to a problem. It then goes on to describe the party as a way to "entertain," implying that it was a social event. Together, these clues suggest that the problem being "beaten" is something related to discomfort or discomfort caused by heat. Therefore, the correct answer is "hot." The other options do not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- hot
--input-- Question: If I go outside and look down, what will I find outside? Options: A: ground,B: sun,C: nature,D: sky,E: street, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if the speaker goes outside and looks down, they are likely to see the ground. The other options (sun, sky, nature) are all located higher up in the sky and would not necessarily be visible by looking downwards. The option "street" could potentially be a correct answer if the speaker is standing on a street or sidewalk, but the phrasing of the sentence suggests that they are simply stepping outside and looking down. Answer is
--target-- ground
--input-- Question: What happens to your car when you're driving to work? Options: A: get to work,B: stress,C: use gas,D: speeding ticket,E: get depreciation, Knowledge: The question is asking about what happens to your car when you're driving to work. Since driving requires fuel to power the engine, the most likely answer is "use gas." The other options don't necessarily relate to the act of driving, but rather the consequences of it (i.e. getting to work, feeling stressed, receiving a speeding ticket, or experiencing depreciation over time). Answer is
--target-- use gas
--input-- Question: Regular pants are sometimes not long enough if a person is very what? Options: A: goofy,B: tall,C: constipated,D: abnormal,E: new, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that regular pants may not fit properly if a person is very something, and one of the choices that fits this context is "tall." Being tall means having a greater height than average, and this could result in pants being too short. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- tall
--input-- Question: John cared for Sally, but Sally couldn't return his feelings. She only felt what? Options: A: unfeeling,B: being mean,C: field,D: disinterest,E: negligence, Knowledge: The sentence states that Sally cannot return John's feelings, suggesting that she does not have romantic interest in him. "Disinterest" means a lack of interest or enthusiasm, which fits with Sally's feelings towards John. The other options, such as "being mean" or "negligence," do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- disinterest
--input-- Question: They were very careful transporting the holy artifact, the last thing they wanted to do was deliver it what? Options: A: profane,B: common,C: halibut,D: broken,E: damaged, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the holy artifact is fragile and requires careful handling. The word "transporting" suggests that the object is being moved from one location to another, further emphasizing the importance of preventing any damage during the journey. The option "halibut" is completely unrelated and can be eliminated. While "profane" and "common" may be opposite in meaning to "holy," neither of them indicates that the object is fragile or requires careful handling. "Broken" is a possibility, but "damaged" is a more general term that covers a wider range of potential harm. Answer is
--target-- damaged
--input-- Question: Where is a tin likely to be stored? Options: A: shopping bag,B: kitchen,C: hardware store,D: grocery store,E: cupboard, Knowledge: Tin is often used to package and store food items such as canned goods, which are commonly kept in cupboards or cabinets in the kitchen. The other options do not make sense for storing tin as they are not typically associated with food storage or packaging. Answer is
--target-- cupboard
--input-- Question: They were worried about the fruit staying fresh in the heat, so they put it in the what? Options: A: san francisco,B: refrigerator,C: gay bar,D: container,E: plate, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that there is a concern about the fruit staying fresh in the heat. The most logical solution for this problem would be to put the fruit in a place where it can remain cool and preserved, such as a refrigerator. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- refrigerator
--input-- Question: On what would you serve an egg to someone? Options: A: chicken coop,B: henhouse,C: plate,D: glass cup,E: bird's nest, Knowledge: It is customary to serve eggs on a plate for human consumption. The other options, such as a chicken coop or bird's nest, are not realistic choices for serving eggs to people. While a henhouse is where chickens live, it is not where one would serve food to someone. A glass cup is not a suitable dish for serving eggs, unless perhaps they are going to be used in a mixed drink or cocktail. Answer is
--target-- plate
--input-- Question: Where can you get a french horn to take home with you? Options: A: concert,B: music class,C: concert hall,D: france,E: music store, Knowledge: The question is asking where you can acquire a French horn to take home, which suggests that the answer must relate to purchasing or borrowing the instrument. Of the options given, the only one that could reasonably involve buying or renting a French horn is a music store. The other options all relate to attending events or classes, which is not necessarily related to acquiring an instrument. Also, the option 'France' is misleading because it states the name of the country as an option, whereas the correct answer would be a store in France. Answer is
--target-- music store
--input-- Question: The roommates were young and irresponsible, it was always a mess at their what? Options: A: apartment,B: table,C: office,D: desk,E: closet, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the roommates are young and irresponsible, which suggests that they may not have good cleaning habits or keep a tidy living space. An apartment is a common living space for roommates, and the other options such as table, office, desk, and closet do not have the same connotation of being a shared residential space that is prone to becoming messy. Answer is
--target-- apartment
--input-- Question: What do criminals do when they are caught? Options: A: they feel happy,B: realise error of ways,C: take money,D: serving time,E: arm themselves, Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of being caught as a criminal. "Serving time" refers to the punishment of being sentenced to a certain amount of time in jail or prison. The other options do not make sense in this context - a criminal would not feel happy about being caught or take money (which would be considered theft) and arming themselves would only lead to further trouble with the law. "Realising error of ways" is a possible answer, but it is not a specific consequence that is always associated with being caught as a criminal. Answer is
--target-- serving time
--input-- Question: What is likely to be a long term negative consequence of of over eating hamburger? Options: A: gaining weight,B: stomach ache,C: get full,D: losing weight,E: death, Knowledge: Overeating generally leads to an increase in calorie intake, which can cause a person to gain weight over time. Hamburger, being a high-calorie food, when overeaten, can cause a significant weight gain. A stomach ache is a more immediate consequence that may occur after eating a lot of hamburger, but it is not necessarily a long-term consequence. Getting full is a normal response to eating and is not negative. Losing weight is the opposite of the expected consequence of overeating hamburger. Death is an extreme consequence that is not relevant to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- gaining weight
--input-- Question: Why might someone decide to having a checkup for followup? Options: A: uncertainty,B: anxiety,C: stress,D: anxious,E: pain, Knowledge: The word "checkup for followup" suggests that this is a medical appointment that is occurring after something else, likely a previous checkup or medical event. The word "uncertainty" suggests that there is still some question or concern that needs to be addressed, which is why the person is having a follow-up checkup. The other options do not necessarily indicate a reason for a checkup for follow-up, as they could apply to a range of different medical situations. Answer is
--target-- uncertainty
--input-- Question: What can a vehicle do to groceries? Options: A: eat,B: feel impact of accident,C: slow down,D: carry,E: travel, Knowledge: The context of the question is related to groceries, which implies that the vehicle would be used to transport them. The word "carry" is the closest in meaning to transporting or moving something from one place to another, which would be the primary function of a vehicle in this context. The other options do not make sense in relation to groceries, as they either involve physical actions that cannot be performed by a vehicle (eating), or negative outcomes that would not be desirable (feeling the impact of an accident, slowing down). Answer is
--target-- carry
--input-- Question: A small dog lived with a a woman who loved him. Where might he have lived? Options: A: person's house,B: dog house,C: canada,D: illinois,E: basket, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog lived with a woman, which indicates that the dog was a pet and likely lived in the woman's house rather than a dog house. The option "basket" may seem like a possible answer, but it is unlikely that a dog would live permanently in a basket. Canada and Illinois are not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- person's house
--input-- Question: What area would you find a large number of wheat fields? Options: A: countryside,B: mill,C: bread,D: eat cake,E: farmer's field, Knowledge: Wheat fields are commonly found in rural or agricultural areas, and the term "countryside" specifically refers to areas outside of cities and towns that are characterized by open fields and natural landscapes. "Mill" and "bread" are related to wheat, but do not necessarily indicate an area in which wheat fields are concentrated. "Eat cake" is unrelated and "farmer's field" is too general to infer a specific crop or location. Answer is
--target-- countryside
--input-- Question: Where are you likely to find well stocked aisles? Options: A: supermarket,B: church,C: car wash,D: sanctuary,E: building, Knowledge: A well-stocked aisle is most commonly associated with a store or supermarket that sells goods. The other options, such as a church, car wash or sanctuary, do not have aisles that would typically be referred to as "well-stocked". A building is a general term that could refer to any type of structure and does not provide enough context to determine where well-stocked aisles might be found. Answer is
--target-- supermarket
--input-- Question: Where can butter be found in small pats? Options: A: refrigerator,B: restaurant,C: inside a mammoth's handbag,D: pastry,E: fridge, Knowledge: The sentence implies that small pats of butter are commonly found in a specific location, suggesting that it is a common item in that context. While butter can certainly be found in refrigerators, pastry, and fridges, these options do not specify the size or form of the butter, making them less likely to be the correct answer. The inclusion of "inside a mammoth's handbag" is clearly a joke and can be eliminated as an option. The most appropriate answer is thus "restaurant," where small pats of butter are often provided with bread or other dishes. Answer is
--target-- restaurant
--input-- Question: Wanting to listen to the radio, what did the man do to it? Options: A: play music,B: turn on,C: train,D: blaring,E: radiotracking, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man wanted to listen to the radio, which suggests that it was initially turned off. Therefore, the correct answer is "turn on." The other options (play music, train, blaring, radiotracking) do not accurately describe what the man did to the radio to be able to listen to it. Answer is
--target-- turn on
--input-- Question: He is beginning work at his first job.  What is he feeling? Options: A: panic,B: resting,C: stress,D: excitement,E: working, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that this is the person's first job, which suggests that they may be experiencing feelings of excitement and anticipation. Starting a new job can be a significant and positive milestone in someone's life, so it's more likely that he is excited rather than feeling panic, stress, or simply resting. The option "working" is not a feeling, but rather an action that will come after starting the job. Answer is
--target-- excitement
--input-- Question: Why do children usually like jumping rope? Options: A: increased heart rate,B: smiling,C: sweating,D: having fun,E: jumping, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a reason why children enjoy jumping rope, which is unlikely to be related to physiological processes such as an increased heart rate or sweating. While those physical effects may be caused by jumping rope, they are not likely to be the primary motivator for why children enjoy the activity. "Smiling" is a possible answer, but it is not specific enough to explain why children enjoy jumping rope. Therefore, "having fun" is the best answer because it directly relates to the enjoyment that children experience from this activity. Answer is
--target-- having fun
--input-- Question: What do I look forward to when opening a business? Options: A: stress,B: success,C: failure,D: bankruptcy,E: cash, Knowledge: The word "look forward to" suggests a positive outcome, and the context of opening a business implies that the goal is to be successful. Opening a business is often associated with hopes and aspirations for success, rather than stress, failure, or bankruptcy. "Cash" could be a factor in success, but it is not the ultimate goal. Answer is
--target-- success
--input-- Question: Where can someone get a flute? Options: A: orchestra,B: steal it,C: marching band,D: symphony,E: musical instrument store, Knowledge: The other options, such as stealing a flute or finding one in a marching band, are not ethical or practical ways to obtain a flute. Orchestras and symphonies may have flutes, but they are typically reserved for members of the ensemble. A musical instrument store, on the other hand, is a place where one can buy or rent a variety of musical instruments, including flutes. Therefore, the correct answer is musical instrument store. Answer is
--target-- musical instrument store
--input-- Question: Why do people go about killing people ? Options: A: murder,B: get killed,C: sporting event,D: hate,E: feel remorse, Knowledge: The word "killing" suggests intentional and unjustified taking of a human life, which is categorized as murder. The reason why people commit this crime varies from person to person, but one common motivation for murder is hate or anger towards the victim. The other options, such as sporting events or feeling remorse, do not align with the severity and intentionality of murder. Answer is
--target-- hate
--input-- Question: For what reason did he commit the killing? Options: A: investigation,B: disease,C: punishment,D: retribution,E: going to jail, Knowledge: The word "retribution" refers to punishment inflicted on someone as vengeance for a wrong or criminal act. In this context, it suggests that the person committed the killing as a form of revenge or retaliation for something that was done to them, making it the most likely answer. "Investigation," "disease," and "going to jail" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, while "punishment" is a possibility but not as specific as "retribution." Answer is
--target-- retribution
--input-- Question: Bobby sat on the examination table.  Happy that this was a simple procedure, and he could do it here instead of staying overnight some place else.  Where might he be? Options: A: hospital,B: school,C: obituary,D: doctor's office,E: vets office, Knowledge: The sentence mentions an examination table, which is typically found in a medical setting. The fact that Bobby is happy this is a simple procedure and that he doesn't have to stay overnight suggests that it's a routine medical check-up or appointment, rather than an emergency or serious illness. The hospital and vet's office options might be plausible, but the language of the sentence suggests a human patient rather than an animal. The school and obituary options have no connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- doctor's office
--input-- Question: Brian was a soldier.  he just got word that he was called back to active service.  He'd have to do what soon? Options: A: report for duty,B: wait for orders,C: fight for freedom,D: obay,E: receive orders, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Brian was a soldier and has received the news that he was called back to active service, meaning he would have to report for duty soon. The other options may be related to being a soldier, but they do not accurately reflect the immediate action that Brian would need to take upon being called back to active service. Answer is
--target-- report for duty
--input-- Question: Where would you put things in a paper bag? Options: A: synagogue,B: classroom,C: grocery store,D: lunchbox,E: front porch, Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the question is related to shopping or carrying items in a bag. A grocery store is a common place to use a paper bag for carrying purchases, while a synagogue, classroom, lunchbox, and front porch are not typically associated with this activity. Answer is
--target-- grocery store
--input-- Question: Where would you put some coffee if you are thirsty? Options: A: container,B: internet cafe,C: starbucks,D: cup,E: supermarket, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is thirsty and wants to drink some coffee. To consume a liquid, most people would use a cup, which is a vessel designed to hold liquids. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- cup
--input-- Question: I went to a party at my friend's house in New York and everyone there shared a meal in what eating place? Options: A: mall counter,B: big city,C: shopping area,D: restaurant,E: dining room, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker went to a party at a friend's house, which implies a more casual setting than a restaurant or mall counter. Additionally, sharing a meal typically takes place in a designated eating area, such as a dining room, rather than a shopping area or big city. Answer is
--target-- dining room
--input-- Question: James loved going down.  He thought that the worst part of climbing was what? Options: A: loss of oxygen,B: blisters,C: ascending,D: vertigo,E: getting a snack, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James enjoys going down, which implies that he doesn't enjoy going up. This eliminates options such as loss of oxygen, blisters, and vertigo, which are all physical ailments that can occur during climbing regardless of which direction one is going. Getting a snack is also unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be ascending, which is the direct opposite of going down. Answer is
--target-- ascending
--input-- Question: Where would explosive devices be used to build and demolish things? Options: A: bomb,B: army,C: war,D: workplace,E: construction site, Knowledge: Explosive devices are commonly used in construction sites for building and demolishing structures. They are particularly useful in cases where traditional demolition methods may not be practical due to safety or space constraints. While bombs and explosives are also associated with the military and war, the context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on their use in a non-violent setting. The options "army" and "war" are therefore less likely to be correct. "Workplace" could be a possible answer, but it is more general and does not specifically relate to the use of explosive devices. Answer is
--target-- construction site
--input-- Question: A child needs caregivers.  Who are the most common caregivers for a child? Options: A: become adult,B: adult,C: swing set,D: parent,E: father, Knowledge: The sentence implies that a child requires the presence of someone to take care of them, suggesting that the answer is a person or group of people. The most common caregivers for a child are typically their parents, as they are responsible for nurturing and supporting their child's growth and development. The other options are either not relevant to the context of the sentence or do not describe a caregiver role. Answer is
--target-- parent
--input-- Question: Where do you bring a small dog if it needs to relieve itself? Options: A: europe,B: front porch,C: heat,D: basket,E: outside, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a small dog needs to relieve itself, which would typically require going outside.

--target-- outside
--input-- Question: Driving is the most popular form of personal what? Options: A: transportation,B: traffic jams,C: moving,D: status,E: traffic accident, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that driving is a common way for people to move from one place to another, which is a characteristic commonly associated with transportation. Traffic jams and accidents may be negative aspects of driving, but they do not describe the purpose or function of driving. Moving may involve a variety of methods, such as walking, using public transportation, or hiring a moving company, so it does not accurately reflect the popularity of driving as a personal mode of transportation. Status may be a reason why some people choose to drive, but it is not the most widely recognized aspect of personal transportation. Answer is
--target-- transportation
--input-- Question: The woman let her son play with it in his room.  She did not do what? Options: A: forbid,B: annoy,C: prohibit,D: stop,E: disallow, Knowledge: The use of the word "let" indicates that the woman allowed her son to play with something in his room, so options like prohibit and disallow can be eliminated as they suggest the opposite action of not allowing something. Annoy is a possibility, but it doesn't fit as well with the context of the sentence. Stop is also a possibility, but it doesn't convey the sense of disallowing something that forbid does. Therefore, forbid is the best choice. Answer is
--target-- forbid
--input-- Question: Where is likely the coziest plat to eat? Options: A: downtown,B: prison,C: city,D: own house,E: earing, Knowledge: The word "cozy" suggests a comfortable, warm, and intimate environment, which is typically associated with one's own house. Eating in one's own house can provide a sense of familiarity and relaxation that may not be found in a public space like downtown, prison, or city. The inclusion of "earing" is likely a typo and does not make sense in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- own house
--input-- Question: Where is a bunch of grapes likely to be carried in? Options: A: fruit cocktail,B: wine press,C: a box,D: picnic basket,E: kitchen, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to carrying a bunch of grapes. Picnic baskets are often associated with carrying food and drinks for outdoor activities, making it the most likely option. A wine press is used for making wine and a box is too general without any specific details about what the grapes are for. The fruit cocktail and kitchen options are also not related to carrying a bunch of grapes. Answer is
--target-- picnic basket
--input-- Question: The monger removed the bone, what was he looking to serve? Options: A: octopus,B: fresh fish,C: skeleton,D: human body,E: dog's mouth, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the monger removed a bone in preparation for serving something. Out of the given choices, only fresh fish is a common food that would require the removal of bones. Octopus is typically served whole or in large pieces, and would not require bone removal. Skeleton, human body, and dog's mouth are all inappropriate choices for food. Answer is
--target-- fresh fish
--input-- Question: James was cooling off in the pool on a hot summer day.  Why might have he been doing that? Options: A: sweating,B: relaxation,C: revenge,D: shivering,E: loss of heat, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was trying to cool off on a hot summer day, which is often done for the purpose of relaxation. Swimming or sitting in a pool can help to reduce body temperature and provide a break from the heat, which may explain why James was doing it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- relaxation
--input-- Question: Where would you enjoy a beer while throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects? Options: A: bowling alley,B: hockey game,C: sporting event,D: croquet,E: fridge, Knowledge: The sentence mentions "throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects," which is a clear reference to the sport of bowling. Bowling alleys are specifically designed for this sport, and they often have bars or restaurants where patrons can enjoy a beer while playing. The other options, such as a hockey game or croquet, do not involve throwing heavy spheres or white objects, and the option of a fridge does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- bowling alley
--input-- Question: Where would you get a baseball if you do not have one? Options: A: sporting goods store,B: america,C: park,D: sandbox,E: break window, Knowledge: A sporting goods store is a typical place to purchase a baseball. The other options, such as America, a park, a sandbox, or breaking a window, do not make sense in this context as they do not relate to how to acquire a baseball. Answer is
--target-- sporting goods store
--input-- Question: The barn was torn to shreds and all the pieces of board became one projectile after another flying through the air, it was a powerful what? Options: A: tornado,B: weapon,C: baseball,D: air,E: canon, Knowledge: The phrase "torn to shreds" refers to a destructive force that has the ability to break down a large object into many small pieces. Additionally, the phrase "one projectile after another flying through the air" suggests a swirling motion that is typical of a tornado. A tornado is a powerful and destructive weather phenomenon that can easily tear through buildings and cause debris to fly through the air. The other options, such as "weapon," "baseball," "air," and "cannon," do not fit the context and would not be able to explain the destructive force described in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- tornado
--input-- Question: The person was bored by the remedial math class, what did he want out of the class? Options: A: look beautiful,B: swimming lessons,C: intellectual stimulation,D: own house,E: time to rest, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person found the math class to be uninteresting, which suggests that they were seeking something else from the class besides a basic level of understanding. The option "intellectual stimulation" is directly related to the sentence, as it suggests that the person wanted to be intellectually engaged by the class. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- intellectual stimulation
--input-- Question: Sally needed a break from her hard work.  She took a vacation, and decided to do what to a sand castle? Options: A: faster,B: piece together,C: construct,D: put together,E: working, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally took a break from hard work by going on vacation and doing an activity that involves building. Sand castles are typically constructed and built, which makes "construct" the most appropriate option. "Faster" and "working" do not make sense in the context of building a sand castle, while "piece together" and "put together" imply that the castle was already in some state of completion before Sally began her activity, which is not indicated in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- construct
--input-- Question: Mary never allowed her animal friend to do what without a leash? Options: A: leave home,B: vomit,C: eating,D: hunt for food,E: fight for life, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mary's animal friend needs to be on a leash when doing a certain activity. The only choice that fits this context is "leave home," as animals on leashes are often taken outside of the house for walks or other outings. The other options are not related to the concept of leash-walking. Answer is
--target-- leave home
--input-- Question: What is a good place for a grumpy cat? Options: A: sand box,B: back yard,C: ground,D: warm bed,E: shelf, Knowledge: The word "grumpy" suggests that this cat would prefer a comfortable, cozy spot to curl up and be left alone. A warm bed is a common place for cats to nap, and the word "warm" implies that it is a comfortable spot. The other options, such as a sandbox or a shelf, do not suggest a comfortable or cozy environment for a grumpy cat. Answer is
--target-- warm bed
--input-- Question: Where does blood travel in a person? Options: A: hospital,B: soccer game,C: capillaries,D: tubes,E: animals, Knowledge: Blood travels throughout the body via a network of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, such as a classroom, park, school, or demonstration. Answer is
--target-- apartment
--input-- Question: What could someone get into if he or she is becoming inebriated? Options: A: fights,B: addiction,C: arrest,D: staggering,E: paralysis, Knowledge: Becoming inebriated often refers to becoming drunk, which can impair judgment, coordination, and impulse control. This can lead to aggressive, harmful, or reckless behavior, such as getting into fights. Addiction, arrest, and paralysis are less common outcomes of becoming inebriated. Staggering may occur as a physical symptom of intoxication, but it is not a consequence that someone would "get into." Answer is
--target-- fights
--input-- Question: They had room for many bedrooms, an office, a study, even a playroom; They certain had a what? Options: A: building,B: nursery school,C: preschool,D: big house,E: small house, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the space being described has room for multiple bedrooms, an office, a study, and a playroom. This suggests that it is a large and spacious living area, as a small house would not have enough room for all of these separate areas. Building is too vague, and nursery school and preschool are not consistent with the context provided. Answer is
--target-- big house
--input-- Question: What could have a hot handle? Options: A: carrying things,B: coffee cup,C: iron,D: frying pan,E: briefcase, Knowledge: Frying pans are often used in cooking and can become very hot, which is why they typically have a handle to make them easier to hold and maneuver while cooking. The other options, such as carrying things, a coffee cup, an iron, or a briefcase, do not typically have hot handles. Answer is
--target-- frying pan
--input-- Question: He fantasied about getting a what while driving to work and the pros and cons of the extra responsibilities and benefits? Options: A: new car,B: promotion,C: boredom,D: impatience,E: pressure, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is thinking about the pros and cons of extra responsibilities and benefits that come with a certain achievement or change in their career. Given the context, the most likely choice is promotion. Driving to work suggests that the person is employed and looking to advance in their career. The other choices don't make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- promotion
--input-- Question: Attempting to light a wet match is likely to result in what? Options: A: make fire,B: rain,C: combustion,D: illumination,E: frustration, Knowledge: The phrase "wet match" suggests that the match is damp or moist, which means that it will not light easily. This is because the moisture can prevent the match from igniting, and can also put out the flame if the match does light. Therefore, attempting to light a wet match is more likely to result in frustration rather than any of the other options suggested. Answer is
--target-- frustration
--input-- Question: What is the worst thing that someone can do while driving? Options: A: getting somewhere,B: use gas,C: doze off,D: listening others,E: speeding ticket, Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is one specific action that is considered the "worst thing" to do while driving. From a safety perspective, dozing off or falling asleep while driving is extremely dangerous and can result in serious accidents. The other options such as "getting somewhere" or "using gas" are not inherently dangerous while driving, while "listening to others" is not specific enough to the context and "speeding ticket" refers to a consequence of bad driving, rather than the action itself. Answer is
--target-- doze off
--input-- Question: Where is the best place to put shoes? Options: A: closet,B: table,C: box,D: bed,E: park, Knowledge: The question is asking about the best place to store shoes, which suggests that the answer should be a location where shoes can be organized and kept out of the way when not in use. A closet is a common location for storing shoes as it allows for easy organization and access, while keeping them hidden away from the rest of the living space. The other options do not provide an adequate solution for shoe storage. Answer is
--target-- closet
--input-- Question: James's hammer bent while he was driving nails. He needed a new one.  Where might he go to find one? Options: A: repair shop,B: carpenter's toolbox,C: tool box,D: hardware store,E: tool shop, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James needs a new hammer, which is a common tool found in hardware stores. Hardware stores typically carry a wide range of tools, including hammers, and are a common place to buy tools for household or DIY projects. While a repair shop or tool shop could potentially have hammers, they are not as commonly associated with selling these types of tools. A carpenter's toolbox or personal tool box may not have a new hammer readily available, as these are typically stored with the owner's personal tools. Answer is
--target-- hardware store
--input-- Question: What happens when you get a blackout from amnesia? Options: A: amnesia,B: drunkenness,C: hangover,D: enjoy,E: burn, Knowledge: The question is asking about the result of getting a blackout from amnesia, which suggests a loss of memory. Amnesia is a condition where a person experiences memory loss, which could result in a blackout. The other options do not relate to the concept of memory loss, making them incorrect choices. Answer is
--target-- amnesia
--input-- Question: A woodworker is missing a screw, where should he look for it? Options: A: tool box,B: wall outlet fixture,C: on the ground,D: motorcycle,E: computer, Knowledge: A screw is a small, metal fastener commonly used in woodworking. Therefore, it is logical to assume that the missing screw would be found in a place where woodworking tools and materials are stored. The tool box is a common storage location for screws, while the other options have no connection to woodworking or screws. Answer is
--target-- tool box
--input-- Question: Her dream was to own a house on the countryside, but instead she lived in a cramped apartment in the what? Options: A: street,B: ghetto,C: residential area,D: subdivision,E: city, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman did not fulfill her dream of owning a house in the countryside and instead settled for a cramped apartment. The word "city" provides a clear contrast to the dream of living in the countryside, while the other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well. "Street" and "residential area" could refer to a variety of locations, while "ghetto" and "subdivision" have negative and positive connotations respectively, which are not implied in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- city
--input-- Question: In a predicament an animal might choose flight or what? Options: A: leave home,B: hunt for food,C: smell prey,D: feel pain,E: fight for life, Knowledge: The word "predicament" suggests a difficult or challenging situation, in which an animal might need to protect itself. The option "fight for life" is the most appropriate response, as it implies that the animal is facing a life-threatening situation and might need to use aggression to protect itself. The other options do not necessarily relate to survival in a dangerous circumstance. Answer is
--target-- fight for life
--input-- Question: What container does peanut butter come in? Options: A: cupboard,B: pantry,C: jar,D: bottle,E: supermarket, Knowledge: Peanut butter is commonly sold in jars, which are typically made of glass or plastic and have a screw-on lid for easy opening and closing. The other options, such as cupboard and pantry, are places where you might store peanut butter once it's been opened and transferred to a different container. A bottle would be an unusual choice for peanut butter packaging, and supermarkets are places where you can buy peanut butter, but they are not the specific container that it comes in. Answer is
--target-- jar
--input-- Question: The war was followed by a tentative peace.  People didn't think it would last because despite a desire to move forward, there rebuilding was difficult and there was a lot of what? Options: A: love and understanding,B: fighting,C: hostility,D: destruction,E: turmoil, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite a desire for peace, there were difficulties in rebuilding and a sense of instability or upheaval. Turmoil means a state of great disturbance, confusion or uncertainty, and is a suitable word to describe the situation described in the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the sense of unrest and uncertainty conveyed by the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- turmoil
--input-- Question: What could cats do if they were taller? Options: A: annoy,B: eat meat,C: open doors,D: need food,E: jog, Knowledge: The question asks about what cats could do if they were taller. Cats, being intelligent creatures, might be able to do certain things if they were tall enough to reach or grasp objects that they cannot currently reach, such as opening doors. The other choices - annoy, eat meat, need food, and jog - either do not have any clear connection to the context of the question or have no direct relation to a cat's ability to be taller. Answer is
--target-- open doors
--input-- Question: The snake was worried about predators overhead, where did it go for cover? Options: A: wooded area,B: tropical forest,C: warm place,D: canyon,E: sleeping bag, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the snake was seeking cover from predators that may be above ground, which suggests that it was seeking shelter under some sort of overhead cover. A wooded area would provide ample opportunity for the snake to seek shelter under branches and leaves. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence, as a tropical forest or warm place may not provide enough overhead cover and a canyon or sleeping bag do not seem like feasible options for a snake seeking cover. Answer is
--target-- wooded area
--input-- Question: Where can you take home a hermit crab? Options: A: pet shop,B: fishmongers,C: intertidal zone,D: tidepools,E: ocean, Knowledge: Hermit crabs are commonly sold as pets in pet shops, making this the most likely answer. Fishmongers sell fish, not hermit crabs, and the intertidal zone and tidepools are natural habitats where hermit crabs might be found but not taken home. The ocean is too vast to pinpoint a specific location to take home a hermit crab. Answer is
--target-- pet shop
--input-- Question: Why is someone getting drunk likely to sleep with someone they usually wouldn't approve of? Options: A: tired,B: violence,C: falling down,D: lower standards,E: vomiting, Knowledge: Alcohol consumption can impair judgment and decision-making abilities, leading individuals to make choices they may not make if they were sober. This can include choosing to engage in sexual activity with someone they may not typically find attractive or approve of. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for this behavior, and may not be related to alcohol consumption. Answer is
--target-- lower standards
--input-- Question: Where should meat to be used soon be? Options: A: freezer,B: fridge,C: butcher shop,D: counter,E: frying pan, Knowledge: The question suggests that the meat is not going to be used immediately and needs to be stored properly to prevent spoilage. Freezing is an option for long-term storage, but the question specifies that it needs to be used soon, so the freezer is not the best answer. Butcher shop and frying pan are not options for storing meat. The counter is not a good choice either, as it can lead to bacterial growth if the meat is left at room temperature for too long. The fridge is the most appropriate answer for storing meat that needs to be used soon, as it will slow down bacterial growth and keep the meat fresh for a few more days. Answer is
--target-- fridge
--input-- Question: Where does someone get a rubber for sex? Options: A: drug store,B: wallet,C: bedside table,D: house,E: classroom, Knowledge: The word "rubber" in this context refers to a condom, which is a form of contraception used during sexual activity. Condoms are typically sold in drug stores, as well as other places like supermarkets, convenience stores, and health clinics. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- drug store

Options: A: slippery,B: floor,C: store,D: drawer,E: basement, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James tripped over something in the house, which implies that the toys were on the floor where he was running. Additionally, his mother had warned him to put his toys away, indicating that they were likely scattered on the floor rather than neatly stored in a drawer or a basement. The options "slippery" and "store" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- floor
--input-- Question: Large fluffy clouds do what to people who watch them? Options: A: blanket,B: cause rain to fall,C: awe inspiring,D: rain water,E: bring rain, Knowledge: The phrase "large fluffy clouds" suggests that the clouds have a visually pleasing and impressive appearance which can often evoke feelings of wonder or amazement in people who observe them. The option "blanket" does not make sense in the context of the sentence, "cause rain to fall" and "bring rain" suggests that the clouds are responsible for precipitation which is not mentioned in the sentence, and "rain water" is not a suggested effect of observing the clouds. Answer is
--target-- awe inspiring
--input-- Question: She had to run errands that day, she did it right away because she prefers to what? Options: A: complete tasks,B: gain,C: make tea,D: helpful,E: get things done, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the woman completed her errands right away, suggesting that she has a preference for efficiency and productivity. The phrase "get things done" directly relates to this idea of being productive and completing tasks. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- get things done
--input-- Question: The person forgot to put a lid on the garbage, raccoons knocked all of it out of the what? Options: A: container,B: composted,C: nice aroma,D: smell terrible,E: smells bad, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person forgot to put a lid on a container, likely a garbage can, and that raccoons were able to knock all of the garbage out. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence. "Composted" implies that the garbage was being turned into compost, which is not mentioned. "Nice aroma" suggests the garbage smelled good, which is not the case in the sentence. "Smell terrible" and "smells bad" describe the smell of the garbage, but do not indicate what the raccoons knocked it out of. Answer is
--target-- container
--input-- Question: Sometimes when animals meet, what happens? Options: A: fight each other,B: procreate,C: sleep,D: live lives,E: listen to each other, Knowledge: The word "meet" suggests that the animals are encountering each other for the first time, and given the range of options, it is likely that there will be some sort of interaction or reaction. "Procreate" would only occur if the animals were of the opposite sex and willing to mate. "Sleep" and "live lives" are too general and could happen regardless of whether animals meet or not. "Listen to each other" might occur in some cases, but it is less likely than animals fighting each other to establish dominance. Answer is
--target-- fight each other
--input-- Question: A judge was on his bench serving justice, what was his most important principle? Options: A: honest,B: lawyre,C: fair,D: arranging files,E: tell truth, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the judge was doing his job on his bench, and the most important principle related to his job would be the idea of being fair. Being fair is a foundational principle of serving justice, thus marking it as the most important principle. The other options - honest, lawyer, arranging files, and telling the truth - do not relate directly to the idea of serving justice, and hence do not qualify as the answer. Answer is
--target-- fair
--input-- Question: Where can you find a story in print? Options: A: bookstore,B: school,C: newspaper,D: past,E: book or magazine, Knowledge: A story in print can refer to a work of fiction or non-fiction that is published in a physical format such as a book or a magazine. Bookstores are a common place to find books, while schools may have textbooks or novels for students to read. Newspapers typically contain news articles and not fiction or longer-form stories. The option "past" does not make sense in this context as it is not a physical location or item where stories can be found. Answer is
--target-- book or magazine
--input-- Question: Why would someone want to be eating? Options: A: satisfaction,B: dyspepsia,C: indigestion,D: to gloat,E: gaining weight, Knowledge: Eating is usually done to satisfy hunger and provide the body with necessary nutrients to maintain health. The other options, such as dyspepsia and indigestion, are negative outcomes from overeating or eating unhealthy foods. To gloat does not relate to the act of eating, and gaining weight may be a consequence of frequent overeating but is not a reason someone would want to eat. Answer is
--target-- satisfaction
--input-- Question: Where would you go to learn how to play a french horn? Options: A: music store,B: concert hall,C: music class,D: france,E: on top of a mountain, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the learner is looking for a formal setting to learn how to play a french horn. While one could potentially find resources and guidance in other settings, such as a music store or concert hall, a music class is a dedicated space for learning and instruction. France may be associated with the instrument due to its name, but it is not a relevant answer for where to learn how to play it. On top of a mountain is clearly an absurd choice and can be eliminated. Answer is
--target-- music class
--input-- Question: Joe crossed the half court boundary and focused on 3 pointers.  What game is his playing? Options: A: society,B: sporting event,C: football,D: atlas or map,E: basketball, Knowledge: The sentence mentions the half court boundary and 3 pointers, which are specific to the game of basketball.

--target-- basketball
--input-- Question: Other than water, sugar is the main ingredient in what? Options: A: candy bar,B: soda pop,C: coffee,D: tea,E: cupboard, Knowledge: The sentence states that sugar is a main ingredient, which implies that it is being used as a sweetener in a food or beverage. Candy bars and tea often contain sugar, but water is not a typical ingredient in either. Coffee may be sweetened with sugar, but it is not a main ingredient. Cupboard is not a food or beverage, so it can be eliminated as an option. Therefore, soda pop, which is known to contain high amounts of sugar, is the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- soda pop
--input-- Question: It was a nice day out, good weather to fire up the grill out in the what? Options: A: restaurant,B: kitchen,C: park,D: back yard,E: backyard, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is talking about a place where they can fire up a grill, which is typically done outdoors. The options "restaurant" and "kitchen" do not make sense in this context, as those are indoor spaces where grilling would not typically occur. "Park" could be a possible option, but the use of the word "out" suggests that the speaker is already outside, so they would not need to go to a park to grill. Therefore, the best answer would be "backyard," which is a common outdoor space for grilling. Answer is
--target-- backyard
--input-- Question: Steve needed a place to sleep so he asked around and found a place to stay.  Where might he be staying? Options: A: apartment,B: friend's house,C: tent,D: outside,E: living room, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Steve asked people for a place to stay, which implies that he is likely staying with someone he knows. The options "apartment" and "tent" do not fit the context of the sentence because they imply that Steve found a place to stay on his own. The option "outside" is unlikely because it suggests Steve would be sleeping outdoors, which is not a common or safe option. The option "living room" is a possibility, but the most likely answer is "friend's house" since it is common for people to offer a spare room or couch to a friend in need. Answer is
--target-- friend's house
--input-- Question: The man reduced the town to rubble out of hate, what was his goal? Options: A: wage war,B: play nice,C: fight enemy,D: stab to death,E: destroy enemy, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's goal was to completely destroy the town, which is often a tactic used in war to weaken the enemy. In this context, "reducing to rubble" means destroying completely. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not align with the man's actions of hate and destruction. Answer is
--target-- destroy enemy
--input-- Question: What does a child learn to do in a lake? Options: A: become adult,B: row boat,C: drive,D: go out to play,E: begin school, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a child is learning a specific skill related to a lake. The option "row boat" is the most specific skill related to being on a lake, as it involves using oars to move a small boat through the water. The other options, such as becoming an adult, starting school, or driving, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Go out to play" is a more general option that could fit, but it is not as specific as "row boat." Answer is
--target-- row boat
--input-- Question: Where do you keep a chess board? Options: A: house,B: basement,C: toy store,D: cabinet,E: retirement community, Knowledge: Chess boards are typically kept in a cabinet when not in use to protect the pieces and keep them organized. Keeping a chess board in a house is too general and does not specify where in the house it would be kept. Likewise, keeping it in a basement or retirement community is not specific enough or applicable to all situations. Keeping it in a toy store does not make sense as it is not a place where one would typically keep personal items. Answer is
--target-- cabinet
--input-- Question: They were going to play at the theater, part way through there was a what? Options: A: spending money,B: intermission,C: being entertained,D: sleepiness,E: man of la mancha, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the event being described involves a performance at a theater, likely a play or musical. The phrase "part way through" suggests that the performance was interrupted temporarily. An intermission is a common pause in live performances that allows the audience to take a break, use the restroom, and purchase refreshments. "Spending money" and "being entertained" are too vague and do not relate directly to the context of the sentence. "Sleepiness" is unrelated and "man of la mancha" is a specific reference that does not fit the sentence. Answer is
--target-- intermission
--input-- Question: Where would you carry a small folding knife? Options: A: kitchen drawer,B: fishing boat,C: pocket,D: garbage bag,E: table, Knowledge: A small folding knife is often carried in a pocket for convenience and easy access. The other options do not make sense in the context of carrying a knife, as they are not locations where a knife would typically be stored or used. A kitchen drawer might contain a larger knife used for cooking, a fishing boat might have specialized knives for cleaning fish, and a garbage bag and table are not relevant to the question. Answer is
--target-- pocket
--input-- Question: Where would you go if you want to get a newspaper with a specific title? Options: A: library,B: magazine article,C: archives,D: safe deposit box,E: page, Knowledge: A library is a common place to find newspapers, especially if you are looking for a specific title. Many libraries keep archives of newspapers on microfilm or in digital format, and they may also have physical copies available for borrowing or viewing within the library. Magazine articles and archives may contain information about the newspaper, but they are not a direct source for obtaining a specific title. Safe deposit boxes are typically used for storing valuable items such as jewelry or important documents, and a page is a part of a book or document, not a location for obtaining a newspaper. Answer is
--target-- library
--input-- Question: If you want to find a star you'd have to look in space, but if you wanted to find one from the screen you should travel to where? Options: A: outer space,B: uganda,C: constellation,D: solar system,E: hollywood, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is not about finding an actual star in the sky, but rather a celebrity that is famous and well-known. Since the other options do not have any relevance to the world of entertainment or celebrities, the answer must be "hollywood" which is a famous location known for being the center of the movie industry and the place where many celebrities live and work. Answer is
--target-- hollywood
--input-- Question: What is it called when animals produce offspring? Options: A: birth,B: reproduce asexually,C: lie down,D: procreate,E: feel pain, Knowledge: Procreation refers specifically to the act of animals (and humans) reproducing and producing offspring. The other options do not accurately describe the process of reproduction or are unrelated to the question. "Birth" involves the delivery of offspring, rather than the act of producing them. "Reproduce asexually" refers to a type of reproduction that does not involve the combination of genetic material from two parents.

Options: A: reciprocity,B: make happy,C: make money,D: get drunk,E: embarrassing yourself, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker was feeling down and their friends threw them a party to help cheer them up. The phrase "make happy" directly relates to this situation, as it implies that the friends were trying to improve the speaker's mood. Reciprocity, getting drunk, and embarrassing oneself do not fit the context of the sentence. Making money is also unlikely as a motive for this kind of gesture. Answer is

Options: A: animal shelter,B: big house,C: own home,D: georgia,E: on a leash, Knowledge: A stray dog is one that has been lost or abandoned and is wandering without a home or owner. Therefore, the most likely place to find a stray dog would be an animal shelter, as they often take in and care for lost or abandoned animals until they can be reunited with their owners or adopted by new families. The other options do not necessarily have a connection to finding a stray dog, as a big house or own home may imply the dog already has an owner, while on a leash implies that the dog already has an owner who is taking them for a walk. Answer is
--target-- animal shelter
--input-- Question: The small dog spent a lot of time with the elderly, where did he volunteer? Options: A: own house,B: nursing home,C: park,D: own home,E: suburb, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the small dog volunteered somewhere, and given the context of spending time with the elderly, a nursing home is the most likely option.

Answer is
--target-- nursing home

Options: A: public office,B: out of doors,C: candles,D: chicken coop,E: barn, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite being a weasel, Bill was someone you would want on your side.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- public office

Options: A: cuba,B: fish market,C: books,D: france,E: canada, Knowledge: The question is asking for a specific location where one can find information about the anatomy of a blowfish in print.

Options: A: dry mouth,B: changing behavior,C: hurt feelings,D: communicating with others,E: anger, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that talking to others can improve our emotional state, but if those individuals are mean or hurtful, they can have the opposite effect and cause negative emotions such as hurt feelings. The other options, dry mouth, changing behavior, communicating with others, and anger, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not mentioned as potential outcomes of talking to mean people. Answer is
--target-- hurt feelings
--input-- Question: Everyone is ordinary but we are often told we are what? Options: A: unbelievable,B: strange,C: special,D: ugly,E: exceptional, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite everyone being ordinary, they are often told that they possess a quality that sets them apart from others. The word "special" fits this context, as it connotes a unique quality that makes someone stand out from the crowd. The other options, such as "ugly" and "strange," do not fit the positive tone of the sentence and are not supported by the context. "Unbelievable" and "exceptional" may be fitting options, but "special" is the most appropriate given the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- special

Options: A: city,B: town,C: rooms,D: fall down,E: urban area, Knowledge: The question implies that something can be added to a building to increase its size. Out of the options given, only "rooms" makes sense as something that can be added to a building.

--target-- rooms
--input-- Question: Where might someone drive through rows of apple tree? Options: A: countryside,B: mountains,C: front yard,D: wisconsin,E: washington state, Knowledge: Rows of apple trees are commonly found in orchards, which are often located in rural areas such as the countryside. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of driving through rows of apple trees. The mountains may have trees, but apple orchards are not commonly found at high altitude. Front yards may have apple trees, but they would not be arranged in rows like in an orchard. Wisconsin and Washington State are known for apple production, but simply being in those states does not necessarily indicate that someone would be driving through rows of apple trees. Answer is
--target-- countryside
--input-- Question: Most animals get tired, and when they do they what? Options: A: bite,B: groom,C: procreate,D: keep alive,E: lie down, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when animals get tired, they do something to rest or take a break. Biting or grooming does not necessarily help them rest, while procreation and keeping alive are not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be "lie down," which is a common way animals rest when they are tired. Answer is
--target-- lie down

Options: A: movies,B: supermarket,C: mall,D: jar,E: television, Knowledge: The other options do not typically sell food items, whereas a supermarket is a common place to purchase groceries and snacks like candy. Movies may have a concession stand that sells candy, but it wouldn't typically offer a wide variety of foods.

Answer is

Options: A: anxiety,B: wait turn,C: late,D: terrible,E: nauseous, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the claustrophobic person was feeling a certain emotion while getting in line. Claustrophobia is a fear of confined spaces, which can cause anxiety and panic in those who suffer from it. The other options, such as "wait turn" and "late," do not have a direct connection to the claustrophobia described in the sentence. "Nauseous" may be a physical reaction to anxiety, but it is not specific to claustrophobia. "Terrible" is too vague to be a likely answer. Answer is
--target-- anxiety

Options: A: found in stall,B: farmhouse,C: doing farm work,D: ridden,E: found on ranch, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the horse had given many rides that day and was likely tired, so it is reasonable to assume that he would have been resting in his stall. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The option "ridden" is incorrect because it doesn't provide an answer to where the horse was found. Answer is
--target-- found in stall
--input-- Question: What was the practical husband concerned most about when house shopping? Options: A: arriving,B: location,C: excitement,D: movement,E: expense, Knowledge: The word "practical" suggests that the husband is focused on functionality and cost-effectiveness rather than novelty or adventure.

--target-- expense

Options: A: georgia,B: kitchen cupboard,C: brewery,D: chemistry lab,E: restaurant, Knowledge: The word "decanter" is often associated with pouring liquids, and in a chemistry lab, it may be used to transfer chemicals from one container to another. Decanters are also commonly used to aerate wine before drinking, but this answer choice is outside of the scope of the question, as it specifies "outside of drinking alcohol." The kitchen cupboard and restaurant answer choices do not have any clear connection to decanters, while the brewery answer choice specifies alcohol, which is excluded in the question. Answer is
--target-- chemistry lab

Options: A: drink,B: begin work,C: have lunch,D: eat quickly,E: spend money, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person is hesitant to get food because work has been slow, which suggests that they may be short on money. This would make spending money on lunch an undesirable option. The other choices do not directly relate to the context of the sentence - drinking, beginning work, or eating quickly may not necessarily require spending money, and having lunch is not necessarily an action that one would avoid due to financial concerns. Answer is
--target-- spend money

Options: A: home,B: tree house,C: friend's house,D: neighbor's house,E: restaurant, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the character is in someone else's kitchen, based on the phrase "of people who just moved in to town."

Options: A: lie,B: shaking hand,C: nod and smile,D: nodding,E: pick at your bunions, Knowledge: The question asks what happens if you agree with someone but do not keep the agreement.

--target-- lie

Options: A: bedroom,B: desktop,C: table building,D: corner,E: office, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is discussing where to put a lamp in the room where they sleep. Since the lamp is for personal use in the sleeping area, it is most likely meant for the bedroom.

--target-- bedroom
--input-- Question: Where is a good place to put a rosebush? Options: A: park,B: delaware,C: lawn,D: planting,E: washington, Knowledge: Rosebushes are typically planted in areas with well-drained soil and plenty of sunlight. A lawn is an ideal location for a rosebush because it provides these conditions while also giving the plant room to grow and spread out.

Options: A: being able to use,B: disagreements,C: spending money,D: economic boom,E: wrapping, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that some people have a tendency to overshop and purchase products that they would not typically use or need. This suggests that the correct answer should be related to the practicality or usefulness of the products.

Since the vegan has not yet quit veganism, it is likely that they will choose an option that aligns with their dietary restrictions. Eating vegetables would be a logical choice since they are a staple in a vegan diet and are known to be filling and nutritious. Making bread or eating quickly may not necessarily alleviate hunger, and having food is too general without any mention of what type of food. Answer is

"Stop working" is not necessarily a requirement for having lunch, and "spend money" may not be applicable in all situations as one can also bring their own food. "Prepare food" is also a valid answer but it is not as specific as "get food" which implies going out or acquiring food from somewher. Answer is

Options: A: alley,B: lap,C: cellar,D: street,E: home, Knowledge: Tabby cats are domesticated animals and are typically happiest and most comfortable in a familiar, safe environment such as their home.

--input-- Question: What will be made easier during good weather in the winter? Options: A: climb,B: travel,C: ride bike,D: travel,E: go somewhere, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something will be made easier during good weather in the winter. Climbing and riding a bike are physical activities that may not necessarily be affected by the weather, so they are less likely to be the correct answer. "Go somewhere" is too vague and does not provide enough context to choose it as the correct answer.

The options "roof," "park," and "surface of earth" are not relevant to the context of indoor plant care. While plants can certainly be placed in the ground outside and still get plenty of sunlight, the sentence specifies that the question is about how to ensure they get sunlight indoors. This leaves "windowsill" as the most logical choice, as placing plants on a windowsill is a common way to ensure they get sufficient sunlight while indoors. Answer is

Options: A: bathroom,B: trash,C: drug store,D: beauty salon,E: box, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hair dryer was still in its original packaging, which would most likely be a box.

The other options, such as "uphill", "asia", and "encyclopedia", have no clear connection to the behavior of gazelles.

The options "bus station" and "bus" may be tempting choices, but the key word "sections" suggests that the vehicle being referred to is not a bus, which is usually made up of a single compartment.

Options: A: explode,B: stage fright,C: injury,D: get attention,E: being appreciated, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the expert is performing on stage and is hoping for something positive to happen. The options "explode," "stage fright," and "injury" all suggest negative outcomes, which are unlikely to be the expert's goal.

Options: A: relax,B: frustration,C: pleasure,D: controversy,E: park, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that being interrupted while creating art can have a negative impact on the artist, as the word "likely" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between interruptions and an emotional response.

Leaves are usually left on the ground to decompose and provide nutrients for the soil, or they may be collected into compost bins. The other options do not make sense in this context; leaving the pile on a roof or in a tree, for example, would be impractical and unlikely. Answer is

The option "potato" is unrelated and does not make sense in context. "Body" and "person's head" are too specific and would not allow the security detail to keep track of everyone in the crowd. "Focus" is too vague and doesn't fit the context. Therefore, the most logical answer is "faces" because it is common for security personnel to continually scan the faces of people in a crowd to identify potential threats or individuals of interest.

Options: A: house,B: kitchen,C: car,D: drugstore,E: bedroom, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Denny was searching for his hairbrush in his living space, which eliminates the options of car and drugstore. The fact that he closed the door behind him hints that he was searching in a room, which could be his bedroom or any other room in the house. However, since the sentence doesn't provide any cues about his morning routine or where he usually keeps his hairbrush, bedroom seems like the most logical option. Answer is
--target-- bedroom

The other options, such as Washington state, a swamp or woods, are not geographically related to the sentence and do not provide any relevant information. Answer is
--target-- illinois
--input-- Question: What is usually too small for a cat to fit into? Options: A: american home,B: barn,C: paper bag,D: bed,E: own home, Knowledge: Cats are known for their love of small, enclosed spaces, such as boxes or bags. It is common knowledge that cats often try to fit into small spaces, even if they are too small for them. The options "american home," "barn," "bed," and "own home" do not have any clear connection to the context of the question, making "paper bag" the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- paper bag
--input-- Question: The roses flowered in June.  Sarah loved smelling the what? Options: A: blossom,B: vase,C: park,D: cast shadow,E: open, Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sarah enjoyed the scent of the roses, which is typically associated with the blossoming stage of the flower rather than when it is a closed bud (i.e., not yet open). The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as a vase or a park do not give context to the act of smelling, nor does "cast shadow" or "open" have relevance to the sentence. Answer is
--target-- blossom
--input-- Question: Everyone is special. Everyone has what? Options: A: feelings,B: unique personality,C: values,D: experiences,E: different standards, Knowledge: The statement suggests that every individual possesses something that sets them apart from others, something that defines their individuality. Personality is often a term used to describe a person's distinctive character, behavior, and attitude traits that distinguish them from others. The other choices, such as values or experiences, may be important aspects of an individual's life but do not capture the essence of what makes everyone unique. Answer is
--target-- unique personality
--input-- Question: The situation was a perfect series of disasters, it was just what? Options: A: terrible,B: mistake,C: defective,D: train,E: flaws, Knowledge: The sentence describes a series of disasters, indicating that something has gone wrong in multiple ways. The word "perfect" suggests that these disasters have occurred in a particularly complete or thorough way, further emphasizing the severity of the situation. "Terrible" best captures the negative tone and sense of calamity conveyed by the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the severity or comprehensiveness of the described disasters. Answer is
--target-- terrible
--input-- Question: You can find an anemone living in what kind of fluid? Options: A: tide pool,B: dictionary,C: sea water,D: south pacific,E: movie scene, Knowledge: Anemones are marine animals that typically live in saltwater environments. The options "tide pool" and "sea water" are both related to marine environments, but tide pools are small bodies of water that form along rocky coastlines during low tide, and may not necessarily contain anemones. "South Pacific" is a region, and "movie scene" and "dictionary" are not related to the context of the question. Therefore, "sea water" is the most likely correct answer. Answer is
--target-- sea water
--input-- Question: Why is a person likely to stop eating hamburger and save the rest for later? Options: A: sadness,B: being full,C: heartburn,D: food poisoning,E: death, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is no longer hungry and chooses to save the remaining hamburger for later consumption. This suggests that the person has eaten a sufficient amount of food and is now "full." The other options do not provide a relevant reason for stopping to eat the hamburger. Sadness and death are unlikely to be related to food consumption, while heartburn and food poisoning may cause a person to stop eating but are not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- being full

Options: A: distractions,B: water mark,C: put down,D: noise,E: picks up, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Joe was trying to be gentle when setting the cup on the table, which suggests that he was trying to avoid making any loud or disruptive sounds that could be considered a distraction.

--target-- noise
--input-- Question: Even if not all events are enjoyable, what is a person traveling to many different places likely to have? Options: A: lots of tickets,B: interesting experiences,C: compliments,D: feel pleasure,E: look attractive, Knowledge: The sentence implies that traveling to many different places will result in a variety of experiences, not all of which may be enjoyable. Therefore, it is likely that the person will have interesting experiences, which is a broad term that can encompass a range of activities, sights, and interactions with people from different cultures. The other options do not logically follow from the context of the sentence - having lots of tickets or receiving compliments are not necessarily indicative of travel experiences, feeling pleasure is too general of a term, and looking attractive is not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- interesting experiences
--input-- Question: Superman refuses to kill.  He does this because he feels that every life is what? Options: A: short,B: finite,C: important,D: good,E: created, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Superman has a principle that he refuses to kill, and the reason for this principle is that he holds a particular view about the value of life. The word "every" implies that Superman believes that all life is valuable, and "important" is a word commonly associated with the idea of something having great worth or significance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- important
--input-- Question: If you're a small dog owned by your father's mother, where would you live? Options: A: the enterprise,B: baby carriage,C: basket,D: grandma's house,E: barbeque, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the small dog is owned by the grandmother of the speaker's father. It is common for small dogs to live indoors as pets, and the most likely place for a small dog to live in this context would be at the grandmother's home. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- grandma's house
--input-- Question: His rural dental office was never crowded, but since moving where it has been nonstop crowded? Options: A: medical building,B: urban area,C: strip mall,D: city,E: metro area, Knowledge: The sentence contrasts the previous location, a rural area, with the current location, which is now nonstop crowded. This suggests that the new location is in a more populous and urban setting. The options "medical building" and "strip mall" could potentially be in an urban or rural area, but do not provide enough information to determine the correct answer. "City" and "metro area" also fit the context of an urban setting, but are more general terms that do not specifically refer to a specific type of location. Answer is
--target-- urban area
--input-- Question: If you're in someone's house, where would you be likely to find plants? Options: A: surface of earth,B: windowsill,C: park,D: roof tiles,E: greenhouse, Knowledge: Plants are commonly kept on windowsills inside a house, as they require sunlight to grow and windows provide access to natural light. Plants are not typically found on the surface of the earth or on roof tiles. While a park may have plants, it is not a location within someone's house. A greenhouse is a location where plants can be grown, but it is not necessarily a feature in someone's house. Answer is
--target-- windowsill
--input-- Question: If a baby is having a bath without an adult present, what might occur? Options: A: being clear,B: personal cleanliness,C: will drown,D: get wet,E: fall, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the absence of an adult during a baby's bath could lead to a dangerous situation. Infants are not able to take care of themselves and can easily drown in just a few inches of water. Therefore, it is important to never leave a baby alone during bath time. The other options do not align with the potential danger of leaving a baby unattended during a bath. Answer is
--target-- will drown
--input-- Question: American humans just graduated high school, where are many of them bound? Options: A: university,B: park,C: unemployment,D: cafe,E: movies, Knowledge: Graduating high school typically marks the beginning of higher education for many Americans.

--target-- university
--input-- Question: James sat in a chair and listened to the speaker.  Where might James be? Options: A: synagogue,B: grocery store,C: auditorium,D: confession,E: office, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is in a place where a speaker is addressing an audience, which is a characteristic commonly associated with an auditorium. Synagogues, groceries stores, and offices are unlikely to have a speaker addressing an audience, and confession is a religious practice that typically takes place in a private setting rather than in a public space with a speaker. Answer is
--target-- auditorium
--input-- Question: Evening began to fall and the woods came to life with different animals that preferred the what? Options: A: daytime,B: night,C: afternoon,D: early morning,E: dawn, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the animals in the woods became more active as evening began to fall, indicating that they are likely nocturnal animals that prefer to be active at night. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they either refer to times of day when animals are typically less active or not active at all. Answer is
--target-- night
--input-- Question: Having food all the time can lead to what? Options: A: digesting,B: not hungry,C: swelling,D: weight gain,E: gas, Knowledge: The sentence implies that having access to food all the time can have negative consequences, which likely include gaining weight. Eating more calories than one burns can lead to weight gain over time. The other options are less likely to be connected to the context of the sentence: "digesting" is not a negative consequence, "not hungry" suggests a lack of consequences rather than a negative one, "swelling" may happen occasionally but is not generally a consequence of having food available all the time, and "gas" is also an unlikely consequence. Answer is
--target-- weight gain
--input-- Question: Where would you store a violin along with all of your other instruments? Options: A: string quartet,B: orchestra,C: band room,D: attic,E: music room, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is storing musical instruments. A violin is a traditional orchestral instrument and would likely be stored in a music room, where other instruments are typically kept. The other options (string quartet, orchestra, band room, attic) all describe places where music is played or performed, rather than stored. Answer is
--target-- music room
--input-- Question: Who can I play with if I know how to play an upright piano? Options: A: college,B: band,C: living room,D: military,E: house, Knowledge: Playing an upright piano is typically associated with playing music in a group setting, such as a band, rather than an individual setting like a living room or house. It is also not typically associated with the college or military contexts. Answer is
--target-- band
--input-- Question: The audience listened raptly.  They learned much from this.  What did the audience watch? Options: A: show,B: theatre,C: arena,D: presentation,E: concert hall, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the audience was learning from what they were watching, which is a common characteristic of presentations. Presentations are often educational or informative, and the audience is there to listen and learn. The other options, such as shows and concerts, may not necessarily have an educational component and the audience may be there purely for entertainment purposes. Answer is
--target-- presentation
--input-- Question: People wanted to get to their destination quickly, what did they invent? Options: A: confession,B: toilets,C: national park,D: vehicles,E: supermarket, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people wanted to travel quickly, indicating a need for a mode of transportation. This makes the option "vehicles" the most logical choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the sentence, as confessions and toilets are not related to transportation and national parks and supermarkets do not address the need for speed. Answer is
--target-- vehicles
--input-- Question: If you hear about terrible injustices while reading a newspaper what can happen? Options: A: learning about world,B: grief,C: education,D: get angry,E: insight, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that reading about terrible injustices can elicit an emotional response. Getting angry is a common reaction to feeling outraged or indignant about something that is unjust. The other options, such as learning about the world or gaining insight, do not necessarily relate to an emotional response. Grief may be a possible reaction, but it is not as strongly suggested by the sentence as getting angry. Answer is
--target-- get angry
--input-- Question: Where is liquor usually stored in a home? Options: A: fraternity house,B: cabinet,C: bar,D: soft drink,E: night stand, Knowledge: Liquor is commonly stored in a cabinet, also known as a liquor cabinet or a bar cabinet. This is because liquor needs to be stored in a cool, dark place and a cabinet allows for easy access and organization of the bottles. Fraternity houses may have liquor stored in various places, but it is not a common storage option in a typical home. Soft drinks and night stands are also not common places for liquor storage. Answer is
--target-- cabinet
--input-- Question: If your evening meal isn't served on a dish, at what kind of eatery are you eating? Options: A: plate,B: dinner,C: food market,D: near perfection,E: fast food restaurant, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the lack of a dish at an eatery is unusual, and suggests that the setting is likely to be a fast food restaurant where meals are typically served in disposable packaging or on trays rather than on traditional dinnerware like plates. The other choices don't provide any relevant information to help identify the location based on the given context. Answer is
--target-- fast food restaurant
--input-- Question: Billy bought pencils and put them in his what? Options: A: classroom,B: kitchen sink,C: backpack,D: cabinet,E: store, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy purchased something that can be easily carried around, as he "put them in his" backpack.

The other options such as classroom, kitchen sink, cabinet, and store are not suitable for carrying items like pencils around. Answer is
--target-- backpack
--input-- Question: What is it called when the police take a suspect in to custody? Options: A: arrest,B: force law,C: board vessels,D: direct traffic,E: raid, Knowledge: The term "arrest" refers to the act of taking someone into police custody, usually because the person is suspected of committing a crime. The other choices do not have any connection to the context of the question, and are not related to the concept of police custody or law enforcement. Answer is
--target-- arrest
--input-- Question: Family is always the best for devotion, but it is also nice if a person has what? Options: A: good review,B: headache,C: with cat,D: loyal friends,E: shoes, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while family is always the best for devotion, having something else in addition is also nice. The phrase "loyal friends" is commonly associated with companionship, support, and loyalty, which would complement the support provided by family. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- loyal friends
--input-- Question: While doing housework you came across a dusty corner which caused you to start doing what? Options: A: sneezing,B: tired,C: boredom,D: fatigue,E: anxiety, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dusty corner caused a physical reaction in the person doing housework. Sneezing is a common response to inhaling dust and other irritants, so it is the most likely choice. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not a common reaction to inhaling dust. Answer is
--target-- sneezing
--input-- Question: Mandy was watching television because she had a long day.  She could do much else because she was experiencing what? Options: A: joy,B: addiction,C: relaxation,D: fatigue,E: headaches, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mandy was watching television because she had a long day and couldn't do much else. This implies that she was likely feeling tired or fatigued, and therefore chose a low-energy activity such as watching TV. The other options are less likely, as joy would imply that she had a good day and was enjoying herself, addiction would imply a compulsive behavior that overrides feelings of fatigue, relaxation would imply a deliberate choice to unwind, and headaches would imply a physical discomfort that would likely prevent her from watching TV. Answer is
--target-- fatigue
--input-- Question: She let him know he was being over the top, and that his antics where a little what? Options: A: much,B: plenty,C: larger,D: lot of,E: big, Knowledge: The phrase "over the top" is often used to describe behavior that is excessive or exaggerated. The word "much" is commonly used to convey a sense of excess or abundance, which is why it is the most appropriate option in this context. The other options do not convey the same sense of excessiveness as "much." Answer is
--target-- much
--input-- Question: Where can someone get well water? Options: A: oil field,B: field,C: countryside,D: kansas,E: ground, Knowledge: Well water typically refers to water that is obtained from underground aquifers or wells that tap into them, making "ground" the most likely correct answer. While it is possible that someone could obtain water from a field or the countryside, it would likely require additional equipment or treatment to make it safe for drinking. An oil field, on the other hand, is not a likely source of well water as it typically involves the extraction of oil and gas, not water. Finally, Kansas is a specific location and does not necessarily have any relevance to the answer. Answer is
--target-- ground
--input-- Question: what is a characteristic of one who want to give assistance? Options: A: help one,B: helpful,C: listen,D: prepared,E: humanity, Knowledge: The question is asking for a characteristic of someone who wants to give assistance, which implies a desire to be useful or supportive of others. The word "helpful" directly relates to this concept and is the most appropriate choice among the given options. "Listen" and "prepared" are good qualities for assisting others but do not specifically indicate a desire to provide help. "Humanity" is a vague characteristic that may or may not relate to assistance, depending on the context. Answer is
--target-- helpful
--input-- Question: The arch was just one of many sites to see, but most preferred the stained glass at the what? Options: A: doorway,B: cathedral,C: ancient rome,D: building,E: chapel, Knowledge: The sentence implies that there are multiple sights to see, but most people prefer the stained glass at a specific location. The options "doorway", "ancient Rome", "building", and "chapel" do not accurately describe a specific location that would feature stained glass. However, "cathedral" is a common type of religious building that often contains intricate stained glass windows, making it a likely answer. Answer is
--target-- cathedral
--input-- Question: If I wanted to look at a drum, where would I go? Options: A: symphony orchestra,B: child's room,C: music store,D: rock band,E: parade, Knowledge: Drums are a musical instrument that can be found in a variety of contexts, but the most likely place to find one to look at would be a music store. A symphony orchestra may have drums, but they would be part of a larger ensemble and likely not on display for viewing. A child's room may have a toy drum, but it is unlikely that this is what the question is referring to. A rock band may also have drums, but again, they would not be on display for viewing. A parade may feature drummers, but this is not a place where one could easily go to see a drum up close. Answer is
--target-- music store
--input-- Question: The text made no sense, it was just a random what? Options: A: sequence of words,B: book,C: hatred,D: fade,E: analyzing, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the text had no coherent meaning, indicating that it was just a sequence of words without any logical structure. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not convey the same lack of meaning or coherence. A book, for example, might be difficult to understand but would still have some structure or purpose, while hatred and fade do not relate to language or writing in the same way that analyzing or a sequence of words might. Answer is
--target-- sequence of words
--input-- Question: The man was still up at 2:30 am, so he was using the television, what was he hoping he would accomplish? Options: A: eye strain,B: falling asleep,C: laziness,D: boredom,E: get smarter, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was up late and using the television as a tool to help him accomplish something. The options "eye strain," "laziness," and "get smarter" do not fit the context of the sentence. "Boredom" is a possibility, but the context suggests that the man had a specific goal in mind. "Falling asleep," on the other hand, is a common reason for people to use the television late at night, as it can help to create a relaxed and drowsy environment. Answer is
--target-- falling asleep
--input-- Question: What is water to someone? Options: A: dangerous,B: blue,C: toxic,D: important,E: surface of earth, Knowledge: The question is asking for a general description of water to someone, which suggests that the answer should be a broad and fundamental attribute of water. "Important" is the most suitable option because water is essential for all living organisms to survive and is critical for many human activities such as agriculture, industry, and transportation. The other options are either too specific or negative in their association with water. Answer is
--target-- important
--input-- Question: Where did the farmer send the heifer to make money when she was no longer useful to the farm? Options: A: sanctuary farm,B: cow pasture,C: countryside,D: cattle ranch,E: slaughterhouse, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the heifer was no longer useful to the farm, which may mean that it was either too old or unable to produce milk. In such cases, farmers usually sell the animal to make some money. Since "sanctuary farm" and "cow pasture" are not places that buy animals, they can be eliminated. "Countryside" is a generic term and does not specifically relate to the sale of animals. "Cattle ranch" may buy animals, but it is not a common practice to sell unproductive cows to ranches. Therefore, the correct answer is "slaughterhouse," which is where animals are killed and processed for food. Answer is
--target-- slaughterhouse
--input-- Question: The art project called for a big wooden rod, so she went where to get one? Options: A: hardware store,B: tree stump,C: old clock,D: old houses,E: broom closet, Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the art project required a big wooden rod, which suggests that the item is not readily available in the immediate surroundings such as a tree stump or broom closet. The options "old clock" and "old houses" are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. A hardware store is a likely place to find a variety of wooden rods in different sizes and shapes. Answer is
--target-- hardware store
--input-- Question: If you dont fail at life you are? Options: A: completing,B: succeeding,C: passed,D: passing,E: good at it, Knowledge: The sentence presents failure as the opposite of the answer, suggesting that the correct choice is a state of achievement or success. The options "completed" and "passed" suggest a one-time event, while "good at it" lacks specificity and could apply to any skill or activity. "Succeeding" and "passing" are both commonly used to describe ongoing progress and achievement, but "passing" implies a minimum standard of performance, while "succeeding" suggests a higher level of success. Answer is
--target-- succeeding
--input-- Question: Worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain, why are they? Options: A: wet soil,B: start to fall,C: dry soil,D: wet things,E: wet ground, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain, which suggests that moisture is playing a role here. It is a common phenomenon for worms to come out of soil when it is wet because they need moisture to breathe. If the soil becomes too compact or dry, they cannot move or breathe properly, and hence might die. Thus, it is more likely that the worms are coming out due to the presence of wet soil rather than dry soil or other wet things. The option "start to fall" seems to be unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- wet soil
--input-- Question: Where are people likely to enjoy a show? Options: A: theater,B: wedding,C: in the garden,D: opera,E: convention, Knowledge: The options include a few different types of events, but only one of them is specifically associated with shows: the theater. A theater is a venue designed for live performances, such as plays, musicals, and comedy shows. While some of the other options may involve entertainment or performances, they do not have the same strong connection to the idea of enjoying a show as the theater does. Answer is
--target-- theater
--input-- Question: Where might you have to pay for a shopping bag now? Options: A: restaurant,B: closet,C: at starbucks,D: supermarket,E: home, Knowledge: Many supermarkets have started charging for plastic bags to reduce waste and promote reusable bags.

The options of closet and home are not relevant to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- supermarket

--input-- Question: She was known for be soft and sensitive, but when all their wills were tested she was the only one who stood what? Options: A: non sensitive,B: resistant,C: stoic,D: hardened,E: uncaring, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject was known for being soft and sensitive, but in a situation where everyone's wills were tested, she stood out for being different. Being stoic means showing little emotion and not easily giving in to pressure, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options all suggest the opposite of being soft and sensitive. Answer is
--target-- stoic
--input-- Question: There are many dance clubs and higher rates of obesity where? Options: A: united states,B: ohio,C: toun,D: michigan,E: fast food restaurants, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a correlation between the presence of dance clubs and higher rates of obesity. Since the options are locations, we need to choose the one that is most likely to have both dance clubs and high rates of obesity. The United States is a large country with a diverse population that enjoys dancing and has high rates of obesity, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are too specific to be considered a general trend. Answer is
--target-- united states
--input-- Question: A violin and three other instruments play in what? Options: A: orchestra,B: rock band,C: school,D: string quartet,E: music room, Knowledge: The sentence mentions a specific combination of instruments - a violin and three others - which is commonly associated with a string quartet. String quartets are often associated with classical music and are comprised of two violins, a viola, and a cello. The other options do not include this specific combination of instruments, and do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- string quartet
--input-- Question: If your opponents in a marathon is very fast it is easy to fall what? Options: A: lightly,B: behind,C: train,D: slowly,E: sitfast, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if your opponents in a marathon are very fast, you may have difficulty keeping up with them and may fall behind. The word "behind" specifically means to not be in front of or to not keep up with others. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Lightly" does not make sense in this context, "train" is not a verb that describes falling behind, "slowly" suggests moving at a leisurely pace, and "sitfast" is not a commonly used term. Answer is
--target-- behind
--input-- Question: Where do you have to fan yourself in public watching people run and throw balls? Options: A: sports stadium,B: sauna,C: living room,D: appliance store,E: hot room, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a public place where people run and throw balls and it is hot enough to require fanning oneself. A sports stadium is a logical choice because it is a place where sporting events occur where people run and throw balls, and it could get very hot with all of the physical activity and body heat. Saunas and hot rooms are also hot, but they are not typically places where people run and throw balls in public. Living rooms and appliance stores would not normally have this type of activity taking place. Answer is
--target-- sports stadium
--input-- Question: I need to buy frozen food locally in the smaller shop, where would I go? Options: A: grocery store,B: supermarket,C: refrigerator,D: freezer,E: fridge, Knowledge: The sentence states that the person is looking to buy frozen food in a smaller shop, indicating that they are not looking for a large supermarket or chain store. The most likely place to find a smaller shop that sells frozen food is a local grocery store. The options of refrigerator, freezer, and fridge are not relevant as they are appliances used for storing food, not purchasing it. Answer is
--target-- grocery store
--input-- Question: What is it called if a person has poor luck? Options: A: schizophrenia,B: misfortune,C: fearful,D: skills,E: criticism, Knowledge: The question asks for a word or phrase that describes a person who has bad luck. "Misfortune" is a commonly used term to describe someone who is experiencing bad luck or unfavorable circumstances. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. "Schizophrenia" is a mental health condition, "fearful" describes a person who is afraid or anxious, "skills" pertains to abilities or competencies, and "criticism" refers to negative feedback or disapproval. Answer is
--target-- misfortune
--input-- Question: Sometimes people are wronged, and sometimes getting revenge brings them what? Options: A: being happy,B: satisfaction,C: ownership,D: joy,E: disappointment, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting revenge can bring people a certain feeling. "Satisfaction" is the most likely choice as it implies a sense of accomplishment or righting a wrong. "Being happy," "joy," and "ownership" are not commonly associated with revenge and therefore do not fit in the context of the sentence. "Disappointment" is the opposite of what the sentence is suggesting. Answer is
--target-- satisfaction
--input-- Question: Dan is always giving assistance.  He what does he want to create for people? Options: A: better circumstances,B: happiness,C: people helped,D: learning new skills,E: death, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan is providing assistance with the intention of creating something positive for people. "Better circumstances" is the most general and broad option that could encompass a wide range of situations where someone might need assistance, such as financial, emotional, or physical. Happiness and learning new skills are more specific outcomes, while "people helped" is too vague and does not provide a clear goal for Dan's actions. Death is not a plausible option as it does not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- better circumstances
--input-- Question: What do marine life use to shelter themselves from a shark? Options: A: coral reef,B: television program,C: pacific ocean,D: open ocean,E: seaweed, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that marine life needs to shelter themselves from a shark, which indicates that the shark is a predator. Coral reefs are known to provide shelter and protection for various types of marine life, including small fish and crustaceans, which may explain why they are a viable option for sheltering oneself from a shark. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- coral reef
--input-- Question: Where do humans go to be entertained and eat popcorn? Options: A: mall,B: country,C: movie theatre,D: park,E: university, Knowledge: The sentence mentions eating popcorn while being entertained, which is commonly associated with watching movies.

Options: A: railway station,B: deck,C: flight of stairs,D: porch,E: bus station, Knowledge: The phrase "board a vehicle on railing" may refer to boarding a train or other rail-based transportation, which would be done at a railway station. The other options, such as deck or porch, are not typically associated with rail transportation.

--input-- Question: Where are doctors known for going in their off time? Options: A: nursing home,B: emergency room,C: medical office,D: school,E: golf course, Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where doctors are known for going during their free time. While doctors may frequent places such as medical offices or schools for work-related reasons, the other locations listed (nursing home, emergency room) are not typically associated with leisure activities.

Options: A: new york,B: apartment,C: hotel lobby,D: public place,E: bank, Knowledge: A revolving door is a common feature in hotel lobbies, as it allows for easy entrance and exit while also maintaining a comfortable temperature inside the building. It is less common in other locations such as banks or public places, which typically have standard doors or automatic sliding doors.

The mention of spending the night further supports the idea of a hotel lobby. Answer is
--target-- hotel lobby

Options: A: river bed,B: river valley,C: texas,D: california,E: over water, Knowledge: Bridges are structures that are built to cross over bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans.

--target-- over water

Options: A: astronomy,B: arts,C: faith,D: math,E: chemistry, Knowledge: The word "agnostic" suggests that the person is uncertain or skeptical about the existence of a higher power or deity.

Options: A: multiply,B: multiple,C: unite,D: multiplication,E: multiple, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that 9 is related to 3 as a multiple, which means that 9 is a product of 3 and another whole number. This is a common concept in basic arithmetic, where multiples are used to help students understand the relationships between numbers and their factors. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- multiple

Options: A: shampoo bottle,B: hair salon,C: pedestrian's hands,D: at hotel,E: supermarket, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the context is related to travel and staying overnight somewhere.

--input-- Question: The electricity went out and nobody could see or hear the band, what was being attempted? Options: A: building,B: bedroom,C: concert,D: opera,E: church, Knowledge: The mention of a band suggests that the event being described was a musical performance, and the fact that the electricity went out indicates that the performance was being held indoors, possibly in a venue that relied on electricity for lighting and sound equipment. The options "building", "bedroom", "opera", and "church" do not necessarily have any connection to a musical performance, while "concert" is the most likely option given the context. Answer is
--target-- concert
--input-- Question: Where does a potato become softer? Options: A: optical device,B: garden patch,C: blender,D: pantry,E: vegetable stew, Knowledge: The question is asking where a potato becomes softer, indicating that it is already a potato and needs to be cooked or prepared in some way. The options "optical device," "blender," and "pantry" are clearly not related to the process of cooking or softening a potato. A garden patch is where potatoes are grown, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a potato will become softer by being in the garden. Therefore, the correct answer must be "vegetable stew," which is a dish that involves cooking vegetables, including potatoes, in liquid until they become soft and tender. Answer is
--target-- vegetable stew
--input-- Question: Someone left their shopping bag behind when they grabbed a bit to eat, where is the bag likely? Options: A: atlantis,B: retail store,C: closet,D: grocery store,E: restaurant, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone forgot their shopping bag when they went to eat. Since the bag was likely intended for carrying items from a shopping trip, it is most likely to be found at a location that is related to shopping. The options "atlantis" and "closet" are unlikely since they are not related to shopping. The option "retail store" is a possibility, but the sentence implies that the person left the bag behind when they left to eat, so they likely did not go to a retail store afterwards. This leaves "grocery store" and "restaurant" as the remaining options, but since the sentence mentions that they grabbed a bit to eat, it is more likely that the bag was left behind at the restaurant rather than the grocery store. Answer is
--target-- restaurant
--input-- Question: She complained about the radio, what was it doing? Options: A: radiotracking,B: turn on,C: train,D: blaring,E: play music, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the radio was too loud or making too much noise, since the person complained about it. The word "blaring" specifically means to make a loud, harsh, or unpleasant sound, which would fit with the idea of someone complaining about a radio. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, since they either suggest a different action the radio could be doing, or are not related to radio at all. Answer is
--target-- blaring
--input-- Question: What does the government sometimes have too much of? Options: A: canada,B: trouble,C: city,D: control,E: water, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the government can have an excess of something, and the word "sometimes" suggests that this is not always the case. The other choices, such as "Canada" and "water," do not make sense in this context. "Trouble" and "city" could be possible answers, but the word "sometimes" makes the choice of "control" more likely, as governments are often criticized for over-regulating or exerting too much control over their citizens. Answer is
--target-- control

Options: A: reverse,B: stop,C: passenger,D: open the window,E: walking, Knowledge: When encountering a pedestrian crossing the street while driving, it is important to stop the vehicle to allow them to cross safely. Driving in reverse may create more danger and is not a recommended action. The option for "passenger" is not related to the situation of encountering a pedestrian, and "open the window" and "walking" are also not relevant. Answer is
--target-- stop

Options: A: oil refineries,B: wall,C: show,D: own home,E: water fountain, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the plumbing mentioned is not related to providing drinking water. Oil refineries have plumbing systems that are primarily used for processing crude oil and other materials, and are not used for providing drinking water. The other options (wall, shower, own home, water fountain) all contain plumbing systems that are used for bringing water to a tap or shower head, and therefore could potentially be used if someone was thirsty. Answer is
--target-- oil refineries

Options: A: direct traffic,B: give tickets,C: donut shop,D: town,E: wrong place, Knowledge: The fact that the police were well liked and respected suggests that they had a positive relationship with the community. The sentence also mentions that it was easier for the police to interact with the community, which implies that the community was small enough for the police to know the residents personally. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- town

Options: A: ocean,B: first aid kit,C: tsunami,D: snowball,E: backpack, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the item being described has a pocket specifically designed to hold a hydration pack filled with water.

Options: A: animal shelter,B: backyard,C: park,D: dog show,E: georgia, Knowledge: Dog shows are events where owners showcase their dogs and compete for various awards.

Options: A: headaches,B: sore throat,C: distraction,D: misunderstandings,E: cell phone, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people talking during the movie were causing a negative effect for others. Distraction is the most likely option because talking during a movie can be distracting for those trying to watch it. Headaches and sore throat are unlikely because they do not align with the context of the sentence. Misunderstandings and cell phone are also unlikely because they do not fit the context of the sentence either. Answer is
--target-- distraction

Options: A: liquor cabinet,B: haunted house,C: graveyard,D: cemetary,E: funeral, Knowledge: Halloween is often associated with spooky and supernatural themes, including ghosts and spirits.

Options: A: conference,B: livingroom,C: neighbor's house,D: white house,E: card room, Knowledge: The question asks for the location of the closest dining table not in the person's home. The options "conference" and "card room" do not typically have dining tables, while the "living room" may have one but it would still be in the person's house. The "white house" is unrelated to the context of the question. The most likely option left is the "neighbor's house," as it suggests a location outside of the person's home where a dining table would be present. Answer is
--target-- neighbor's house

Options: A: wash dishes,B: eat vegetables,C: eat quickly,D: have food,E: eat hamburger, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mom was in a hurry and did not have time to wait for the child to eat slowly.

Options: A: office,B: bar,C: barn,D: industrial area,E: museum, Knowledge: Milking machines are commonly used in agricultural settings, particularly in barns where cows are milked.

Options: A: hollywood,B: night sky,C: constellation,D: atmosphere,E: solar system, Knowledge: The context suggests that the star is lonely and wishing to be a part of something. It is most likely referring to a group or pattern of stars, which is what a constellation is. Hollywood, atmosphere, and solar system do not make sense in the context of the sentence.

Options: A: group students,B: state facts,C: time test,D: suffering,E: better knowledge, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a teacher is trying to teach or share something with their class.

--input-- Question: He was morally upright and knew he was strong, so who should he protect? Options: A: batman,B: diluted,C: fragile,D: regular,E: weak, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is strong and morally upright, which makes it likely that they would want to protect someone who is weaker or in need of protection. The word "weak" directly contrasts with the idea of strength, and the other answer choices do not fit the context of the sentence.

Options: A: happiness,B: better communication,C: problems,D: confidence,E: comfortness, Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that there are advantages to learning a language specifically for business settings.

Stairwells are commonly found in homes with multiple levels and are a likely candidate for where an elderly person may need to install a railing for support. Decks and houses may also require railings for safety, but not necessarily for assistance in pulling oneself up. Feet is not a logical answer as it is a body part rather than an installation, and a flight of stairs is too vague and could refer to any set of stairs. Answer is

The term "globular cluster" is commonly used in astronomy to describe such groups of stars. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - "night sky," "black hole," and "heavens" are broad terms that do not relate specifically to older stars or their grouping. "Press conference" is completely unrelated to astronomy. Answer is

Options: A: making more money,B: disputes,C: more work,D: more responsibility,E: higher taxes, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer is gaining more land, which implies that they will have more space to grow crops or raise livestock. This would allow them to produce more and potentially increase their profits, leading to the expected positive consequence of making more money. The other options do not make logical sense as a positive consequence of gaining more land. Disputes, more work, more responsibility, and higher taxes would all be negative consequences. Answer is
--target-- making more money

Options: A: look silly,B: sweating,C: ankle sprain,D: high cholesterol,E: becoming tired, Knowledge: Jumping rope is a physical activity that involves repeated impact on the feet, ankles, and legs. An ankle sprain is a common injury resulting from jumping rope, as the constant jumping and landing can put a lot of stress on the ankle joint.

--target-- ankle sprain
--input-- Question: What is the most likely feature of a cat that you can see in the dark? Options: A: eyes,B: litter of kittens,C: four legs,D: nose,E: flippers, Knowledge: Cats have a highly developed sense of sight, especially in low light conditions, due to their large pupils and reflective tapetum lucidum layer in their eyes. This allows them to see in the dark much better than humans can. Therefore, the most likely feature of a cat that can be seen in the dark would be their eyes. The other options, such as litter of kittens, four legs, nose, and flippers do not have any clear connection to the characteristics of cats that would be visible in the dark. Answer is
--target-- eyes

Options: A: recreational vehicle,B: clothes cupboard,C: house,D: mansion,E: bedroom, Knowledge: A "walk-in type wardrobe" generally refers to a large, separate closet area that one can walk into and browse clothing racks and shelves. This type of wardrobe is more commonly found in larger homes or mansions, where space is not as much of an issue. Recreational vehicles and clothes cupboards are unlikely to have this type of feature, and a regular house or bedroom may or may not have a walk-in wardrobe depending on the size and design. Answer is
--target-- mansion
--input-- Question: Bobby found the lamp beside him when he got up. Where was the lamp? Options: A: building,B: house,C: store,D: ocean,E: bedroom, Knowledge: The sentence implies that Bobby found the lamp in a place where he had been sleeping, which suggests that the lamp was most likely located in his bedroom. The other options (building, house, store, ocean) do not make sense in the context of the sentence and are unlikely places to find a lamp beside oneself after waking up. Answer is
--target-- bedroom
--input-- Question: Joe kept all of his school books on a shelf where he could easily get to them when he wanted to study.  Where was this shelf likely located? Options: A: cabinet,B: school building,C: bank,D: bookstore,E: bedroom, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe was keeping his school books in a place where he could easily access them when he wanted to study, which implies that the location was in his home. The options "cabinet," "school building," "bank," and "bookstore" do not fit this context, as they are all separate places from Joe's home. Therefore, the most probable location where Joe's shelf would be placed is his bedroom. Answer is
--target-- bedroom
--input-- Question: The man was riding bike very quickly, clearly he had to what? Options: A: run away,B: get somewhere,C: falling down,D: accident,E: pleasure, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man was in a hurry, which suggests that he had a destination or goal in mind. The options "run away" and "accident" both suggest negative circumstances, which do not fit the context of the sentence. "Pleasure" is unlikely because the sentence does not suggest that the man was enjoying himself, and "falling down" is not a logical consequence of riding a bike quickly. Therefore, "get somewhere" is the most reasonable choice. Answer is
--target-- get somewhere

Options: A: mind,B: class,C: the meaning of life,D: war,E: opera, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the doctor's were trying to decipher something related to the mental patient's confusion, which is a symptom commonly associated with mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. The other options, such as class, war, and opera, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are therefore unlikely to be correct answers. The meaning of life may seem like a plausible option, but it is not directly related to the mental patient's confusion in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- mind
--input-- Question: What could happen after you start family due to babies crying? Options: A: regret,B: stressed,C: have sex,D: need more money,E: spend money, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having a baby can lead to stress due to the baby crying.

Options: A: toenails,B: shower stall,C: mushroom,D: cave,E: basement, Knowledge: Mildew is a type of fungus that grows in damp environments. A shower stall is an area of the bathroom that is often damp and humid, which makes it a prime location for mildew growth. Toenails, mushrooms, cave, and basement do not have the necessary moisture and humidity that mildew requires to grow, so they are less likely to be a common location for mildew. Answer is

--input-- Question: Following a killing, what are the police likely to begin? Options: A: man hunt,B: punishment,C: going to jail,D: retribution,E: investigation, Knowledge: The word "following" suggests that the police are starting a process after a crime has been committed. Since the question is asking what the police are "likely to begin," it suggests that the answer is the first step in the process of addressing the crime. "Man hunt," "punishment," "going to jail," and "retribution" are all steps that may happen after the police have completed their investigation, while "investigation" is the logical first step in understanding the circumstances of the crime. Answer is
--target-- investigation
--input-- Question: What can a child do to quietly pass the time? Options: A: brood,B: read book,C: become adult,D: ask questions,E: clean room, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child needs to pass the time quietly, which implies an activity that is not particularly active or noisy. The option "read book" fits this description, as it is a quiet and solitary activity that can keep a child occupied for long periods of time. The other options do not fit this description - "brood" implies a negative and introspective state of mind, "become adult" is not an activity but a gradual process of growing up, "ask questions" may require interaction with others and therefore may not be quiet, and "clean room" may require physical activity and make some noise. Answer is
--target-- read book

Options: A: atlas,B: countryside,C: united states,D: between to cities,E: repairs, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the individuals are planning a road trip that will take them across a country or region.

--input-- Question: Though its intentions are for the people, freedom often finds itself cast aside under many historical examples of what? Options: A: slavery,B: communism,C: evil,D: captivity,E: good, Knowledge: The word "cast aside" suggests that the context is negative or detrimental to freedom. Slavery and captivity are both forms of oppression and are more directly related to the restriction of freedom rather than its cast-aside nature. "Evil" and "good" are too vague to be a clear answer. Communism is historically associated with oppressive regimes that prioritize the state over the individual, which can lead to restrictions on personal freedoms. Answer is
--target-- communism
--input-- Question: The religious man was explaining that his faith was something that only he could what? Options: A: dream,B: light way,C: belief,D: trust,E: experience, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the religious man is talking about his personal relationship with faith, indicating that it is something that he has gone through or felt, rather than just believed in intellectually. The use of the word "only" also implies that this is something unique to the individual, not something that can be shared or taught. "Dream" and "light way" do not have a clear connection to the concept of faith, and "belief" and "trust" suggest a more intellectual or abstract understanding of faith rather than a personal experience of it. Answer is
--target-- experience
--input-- Question: The blood was everywhere in the operating room, what were the surgeons operating on? Options: A: soccer game,B: musle,C: vein,D: animals,E: person, Knowledge: The context of this sentence suggests that the surgeons were performing an operation in a medical setting, as blood is commonly associated with surgical procedures.

--input-- Question: A cat is a carnivore which means they don't do what? Options: A: get wet,B: wool sweater,C: eat vegetables,D: hunt prey,E: sharp claws, Knowledge: The sentence states that a cat is a carnivore, which means that they primarily eat meat. This knowledge helps eliminate the choices "get wet," "wool sweater," and "sharp claws" as they are not related to the diet of a cat. The correct choice is "eat vegetables" as it directly contradicts with the fact that a cat is a carnivore since they do not eat vegetables. The final option, "hunt prey," is not the correct answer as it is actually a behavior that is associated with being a carnivore. Answer is
--target-- eat vegetables
--input-- Question: I am looking for a gift for someone I barely know, where do I look? Options: A: specialty store,B: christmas tree,C: lost and found,D: department store,E: party, Knowledge: A department store typically offers a wide range of products including clothing, accessories, home decor, and electronics, making it a good option for finding a gift for someone you barely know. Specialty stores usually focus on a specific type of product or theme, which may not necessarily be what the person is interested in. A Christmas tree and lost and found have no relevance to finding a gift, and a party may not necessarily have any options for a gift. Answer is
--target-- department store

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- cell

Options: A: office,B: music store,C: school,D: classifieds,E: landfill, Knowledge: A keyboard is a musical instrument, so it would make sense to look for one at a music store. An office or school would not typically have musical instruments available.

Options: A: knives,B: shoulder,C: giblets,D: guillotine,E: bottle, Knowledge: The context of the question refers to the French Revolution, a turbulent time in French history characterized by radical political and social upheaval. The use of the term "cut through royal necks" suggests a violent and deadly approach to punishing those in power. The guillotine was famously used during the French Revolution to execute thousands of individuals, including King Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette. The other options do not align with the context of the question or historical knowledge of the French Revolution. Answer is
--target-- guillotine
--input-- Question: The student was having difficulty finding information in the book, so he raise his hand and began to what? Options: A: learn,B: turn pages,C: death,D: ask questions,E: go to school, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the student was experiencing difficulty with finding information in the book, which implies that they are seeking help or clarification. In an academic setting, it is common for students to raise their hand and ask questions when they do not fully understand a concept or are struggling with a task. This makes "ask questions" the most logical answer choice. "Learn" is not a specific action that serves to address the student's problem, "turn pages" is not necessarily helpful in finding specific information, "death" is completely irrelevant to the context, and "go to school" is too general and doesn't address the specific issue. Answer is
--target-- ask questions
--input-- Question: James and Ruth were getting a divorce.  It was amicable, but it wasn't happy.  There was a lot of what emotion? Options: A: bitterness,B: sadness,C: depression,D: pain,E: anguish, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while James and Ruth's divorce was not acrimonious, it was still a difficult and emotional experience. The use of the word "amicable" implies that there was not a lot of bitterness or anger involved, but the description of the situation as "not happy" suggests that both parties were likely feeling sad or upset about the end of their marriage. The other options may also be applicable to a divorce, but do not fit as well with the specific language used in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- sadness
--input-- Question: Danny thought about fixing up his floor and making it look good. What might he use to do what? Options: A: carpet,B: chair,C: table,D: bed,E: desk, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny wants to improve the appearance of his floor, which often involves covering it with a material that is aesthetically pleasing, like carpet. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- carpet
--input-- Question: Where might a person go if they need urgent care for a wound? Options: A: body,B: injury,C: patient,D: emergency room,E: hospital, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a wound that requires urgent care. Urgent care is a medical treatment that requires immediate attention, which would logically lead an individual to go to the emergency room. The hospital option is a vague option as different hospitals have different departments and services. Body and patient are not locations and injury does not provide any clear direction as to where to go. Answer is
--target-- emergency room
--input-- Question: He really enjoyed the restaurant, when he got home he gave it what? Options: A: own house,B: loyal friends,C: fever,D: good review,E: with cat, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person had a positive experience at the restaurant, and upon returning home, he did something to express his satisfaction. The most common way to do this is by leaving a good review on a website, such as Yelp or Google Reviews. The other options, such as owning a house or having loyal friends, do not make sense in this context and are unrelated to the experience at the restaurant. Fever and with cat do not fit the situation at all. Answer is
--target-- good review
--input-- Question: Greg couldn't pay the cash advance fee, and thus was dinged for what? Options: A: late payment,B: going backward,C: retreat,D: late payment,E: basic, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Greg incurred some sort of penalty or fee related to his inability to pay a cash advance fee. The phrase "dinged for" implies that this penalty was negative or costly. Based on the available choices, the most likely penalty for failure to pay a fee would be a late payment fee, as this is a common penalty for missed or overdue payments. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- late payment
--input-- Question: If you started killing people for no reason, what are you likely to lack? Options: A: prison sentence,B: going to jail,C: feelings of guilt,D: die,E: hunger, Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a moral or ethical reason why killing people is wrong, and suggests that the person who is doing the killing may not feel guilty or remorseful about it. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "feelings of guilt." The other options (prison sentence, going to jail, die, hunger) are consequences that may result from the action of killing people, but they do not explain why the person is doing it in the first place. Answer is
--target-- feelings of guilt
--input-- Question: What could happen after relaxing for a long time by not doing anything? Options: A: shut eyes,B: falling asleep,C: listening to music,D: reading,E: shut eyes, Knowledge: The sentence uses the word "relaxing" and "not doing anything" together, which suggests a state of relaxation that could lead to sleepiness. The option "shut eyes" is not a plausible answer as it is only a description of a physical action that could happen during relaxation, rather than an outcome. "Listening to music" and "reading" may also be relaxing activities, but they do not necessarily lead to falling asleep. Therefore, "falling asleep" is the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- falling asleep
--input-- Question: If a beautiful person sprays you with a hose what will you be? Options: A: wet,B: cold,C: dull,D: bad,E: rainy, Knowledge: The question mentions someone spraying another person with a hose. This action commonly results in someone becoming wet, as the water from the hose will soak their clothing and skin. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- wet
--input-- Question: Joe loved the smell of the food on their plates.  It really made his what flutter? Options: A: heart,B: restaurant,C: table,D: shelf,E: stomach, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the smell of the food made Joe feel a physical reaction in his body. The most logical body part likely to experience such a reaction is his stomach, as it is directly related to the ingestion and digestion of food. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- stomach
--input-- Question: Stress can affect your mood, sometimes even leading to what? Options: A: headache,B: high blood pressure,C: fatigue,D: depression,E: heart attacks, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that stress can have a negative impact on a person's mood, and can sometimes lead to a more serious mental health issue such as depression. While stress can manifest in physical symptoms like headaches and high blood pressure, the word "mood" implies a more emotional response. Depression is a common condition associated with prolonged stress, and can have a debilitating impact on a person's mental and physical wellbeing. Fatigue can also be a consequence of stress, but it is not specifically linked to mood changes in the sentence. Heart attacks are a more extreme outcome of high blood pressure, which is not always a direct result of stress. Answer is
--target-- depression
--input-- Question: All humans store urine in what organ? Options: A: feelings,B: names,C: naval,D: bladders,E: bladders, Knowledge: The sentence is discussing human anatomy and specifically refers to the storage of urine. The bladder is the organ responsible for storing urine before it is eliminated from the body. The other options, such as feelings, names, and naval, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and are not related to human anatomy. Additionally, "bladders" is repeated twice in the list of choices, so it is the only logical option to choose. Answer is
--target-- bladders
--input-- Question: Where do people go to pray? Options: A: go to church,B: kneel,C: ground,D: ignorance,E: speak to god, Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where people go to pray, which is commonly associated with religious practices. Going to church is a common practice among many religious faiths, where people gather to worship and pray together. Kneeling is a common physical posture while praying, but it doesn't answer the question about where people go to pray. Ground and ignorance have no clear connection to the context of the question, and while speaking to God can be done anywhere, the question is specifically asking for a location. Answer is
--target-- go to church
--input-- Question: Where in a building would you play a board game? Options: A: shelf,B: cupboard,C: shower,D: house,E: den, Knowledge: A den is typically a comfortable room in a house that is used for leisure activities such as watching TV, reading, or playing games. Board games are commonly played in dens, as they provide a relaxed and social environment for players. A shelf or cupboard may be used to store board games, but they are not typically played on these surfaces. A shower is not an appropriate place to play board games as it is a wet area designed for personal hygiene. "House" is too general and does not provide any contextual clues relevant to the question. Answer is
--target-- den
--input-- Question: They were surprised that he enjoy rap, but he explained that every genre has what? Options: A: classical,B: country music,C: hip hop,D: rock,E: good music, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being discussed enjoys rap music, which may surprise those around them. However, the person justifies their enjoyment of the genre by suggesting that every genre has good music within it. This implies that the person believes that there is no inherently bad genre of music, but rather that it is a matter of personal taste. The answer choice "good music" reflects this reasoning, while the other options are specific genres that do not necessarily relate to the argument being made. Answer is
--target-- good music
--input-- Question: What is the largest group of books in North America? Options: A: desk,B: school house,C: library of congress,D: closet,E: classroom, Knowledge: The Library of Congress is one of the largest libraries in the world, with over 170 million items in its collection, including books, maps, manuscripts, photographs, and more. It is known for being the largest library in North America and is a symbol of knowledge and discovery. The other options, such as a desk, closet, or classroom, are not large enough to hold a significant collection of books or have any connection to being a library. Answer is
--target-- library of congress
--input-- Question: Where do you keep more than one drop of blood? Options: A: person,B: test tube,C: human body,D: battlefield,E: doctor, Knowledge: The question implies that the context is relating to storing or collecting more than one drop of blood. A test tube is commonly used in medical settings to hold and preserve samples of blood or other bodily fluids, while the other options - person, human body, battlefield, and doctor - do not seem to be directly related to the idea of storing or collecting blood in a container. Answer is
--target-- test tube
--input-- Question: A worker who never makes much money or status will what? Options: A: labor in vain,B: case things,C: desire to advance,D: keep busy,E: try harder, Knowledge: The phrase "never makes much money or status" suggests that the worker has not succeeded in improving their financial or social standing despite their efforts. The phrase "labor in vain" means to work without achieving any meaningful result or benefit, which would be an accurate description of the situation described in the question. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not reflect the worker's lack of progress or success. Answer is
--target-- labor in vain
--input-- Question: Jack saw little point to communicating beyond the basics.  To him, it was just a means to do what? Options: A: go swimming,B: making friends,C: exchange information,D: people to think,E: confusion, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jack only sees communication as a tool to accomplish something. The phrase "beyond the basics" suggests that he only sees the need to communicate when it is necessary to exchange information. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- exchange information

Options: A: selling,B: get money,C: save money,D: steal,E: spend money, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman has a specific goal when it comes to shopping - to save money. The phrase "on sale" is a common indicator of discounted or reduced prices, which implies that the woman is looking for ways to save money on her purchases. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the idea of saving money through shopping. Answer is
--target-- save money
--input-- Question: What might someone shout when he or she is frustrated? Options: A: mortal,B: satan,C: heaven,D: angel,E: devil, Knowledge: The word "frustrated" implies a negative emotion, and the choices given are all related to religion or mythology. "Devil" is often associated with negative emotions and actions such as anger and frustration, while the other choices are more positive, neutral, or even holy. The meaning of the question is also important in choosing the correct answer, as it specifically asks for a word that someone might shout in a moment of frustration. Answer is
--target-- devil
--input-- Question: What divider is found in a house that has couches and chairs in it? Options: A: living room,B: street,C: binder,D: notebook,E: office suite, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the divider referred to is found in a house, where couches and chairs are typically found in a communal area known as the living room.

--input-- Question: Wood framing is the skeleton for what? Options: A: building,B: closet,C: ship,D: foundation,E: aircraft, Knowledge: Wood framing is commonly used in construction to create the structure or skeleton of a building.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- building
--input-- Question: Rather than fly out for his vacation he decided to take bus, this was a great way of what? Options: A: sitting down,B: making soup,C: live near bus stop,D: saving money,E: sit down, Knowledge: The sentence states that the person chose to take a bus for their vacation instead of flying, indicating that cost was a significant factor in their decision-making process. This suggests that the person was likely trying to save money, making "saving money" the correct answer. The other options, such as "sitting down" or "making soup," have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- saving money
--input-- Question: Where is the most plumbing in a house likely to be found? Options: A: oil refineries,B: underground,C: wall,D: kitchen,E: bathroom, Knowledge: Plumbing refers to the system of pipes and fixtures that bring water into a building and remove waste water. The bathroom is the room in a house where the majority of plumbing fixtures are located, such as sinks, toilets, and showers/bathtubs. While it is possible to have plumbing in a kitchen as well, it is typically a smaller amount and not as complex as the plumbing in a bathroom. Oil refineries and underground locations have no relevance to the context, and while plumbing may be located in walls, this is not the most likely location for it to be found in a house. Answer is
--target-- bathroom
--input-- Question: While moving the antique a wooden rod fell out, but since it was just part of the chimes what was still functional? Options: A: hardware store,B: old clock,C: broom closet,D: puzzle,E: old houses, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wooden rod was part of a chime, which is a component commonly found in antique clocks. The fact that the sentence refers to the object as an "antique" further supports the idea that it is referring to a clock. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- old clock
--input-- Question: Where can you find a rubber shark as a villain? Options: A: museum,B: outside,C: bad movie,D: sea world,E: marine museum, Knowledge: The question suggests that the rubber shark is being portrayed as a villain, which is a common trope in bad movies. Movies often create unrealistic or exaggerated characters to dramatize the plot and create suspense, which may explain why a rubber shark was chosen as a villain. The other options, such as a museum or sea world, do not necessarily have any connection to a rubber shark being portrayed as a villain. Answer is
--target-- bad movie
--input-- Question: He said he also wanted in, he threatened to tattle what? Options: A: differently,B: mere,C: only,D: otherwise,E: anyway, Knowledge: The word "tattle" suggests that someone is threatening to reveal or report something. In this context, the person is threatening to do so if they don't get what they want. The word "also" suggests that this person wants something in addition to what they already have or are entitled to. The word "otherwise" indicates a contrast between two possibilities, which fits with the idea of the person wanting something different or else they will tattle. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- otherwise
--input-- Question: Where are horses found in fields? Options: A: field,B: kept in barn stalls,C: race track,D: countryside,E: fair, Knowledge: Horses are commonly found in fields in rural areas or the countryside where there is plenty of open space for grazing and exercise. Keeping horses in barn stalls or on a race track is not ideal as they need space to move around freely. Fairs are also not a typical place to find horses in fields. Answer is
--target-- countryside
--input-- Question: What type of building is a bank? Options: A: main street,B: secure place,C: pool of currency,D: financial center,E: grocery store, Knowledge: Banks are typically considered to be financial centers because they handle financial transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, loans, and investments. The other options do not accurately describe the purpose or function of a bank. "Main street" and "grocery store" describe the location or physical appearance of a building, while "secure place" and "pool of currency" are general descriptions that could apply to many different types of buildings. Answer is
--target-- financial center
--input-- Question: If I can feel material, then where am I generally speaking? Options: A: fabric store,B: anything,C: attic,D: physical world,E: science lab, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that feeling a material is a sensory experience that occurs in a physical environment. The options "fabric store" and "attic" may be physical locations, but they do not necessarily imply that the person is in a physical context related to touching materials. "Anything" is too vague and does not provide any context for understanding the sentence. "Science lab" implies an artificial environment rather than a natural, physical one. Therefore, the correct answer is "physical world." Answer is
--target-- physical world
--input-- Question: Where would you find food packaged in MRE's? Options: A: fairgrounds,B: picnic,C: neighbor's house,D: supermarket,E: military base, Knowledge: MRE stands for "Meal, Ready-to-Eat" and is a type of food ration used by military personnel in the field. This type of food is not commonly found in fairgrounds, picnics, neighbor's houses, or supermarkets, but is primarily used by the military. Therefore, the correct answer is military base. Answer is
--target-- military base
--input-- Question: Jill walks to the second floor and sits in her cubicle, where is she? Options: A: office building,B: house,C: hotel,D: school,E: a chair, Knowledge: The sentence describes Jill walking to a cubicle, which is typically found in an office building. The other options, such as a house or hotel, do not typically have cubicles. Additionally, the mention of a floor number suggests a multi-level building, which further supports the answer of an office building. The option of a chair is illogical as it does not indicate a location. Answer is
--target-- office building
--input-- Question: What is a heat source that can be obtained for free? Options: A: bedroom,B: fire,C: car,D: solar energy,E: gasoline, Knowledge: The question asks for a heat source that can be obtained for free, which eliminates options like gasoline and a car. A bedroom is not a heat source, and fire may not always be free depending on the availability of wood or other fuels. Solar energy is a renewable and sustainable source of heat that can be harvested using solar panels, making it the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- solar energy
--input-- Question: A traveler from Atlanta wants to meet friends in Hong Kong, so he drives where? Options: A: car,B: bus stop,C: subway,D: skateboard,E: airport, Knowledge: In order to travel from Atlanta to Hong Kong, the most common mode of transportation would be by plane, and the departure point would be an airport. The other options, such as a car or skateboard, would not be practical for traveling such a long distance across an ocean. A bus stop or subway may be used to get to the airport, but they are not the primary mode of transportation for the long journey to Hong Kong. Answer is
--target-- airport
--input-- Question: Doctors gave sedative to the patient complaining of pain, what did he say afterwards? Options: A: enjoyment,B: good sometimes,C: immobilize,D: feels good,E: good feeling, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the sedative had a positive effect on the patient's pain, which is likely to have caused them to feel better. The other options do not accurately reflect the likely outcome of the sedative, which is to reduce pain and help the patient feel more comfortable. Additionally, the option "immobilize" does not make sense in the context of a sedative for pain relief. Answer is
--target-- feels good
--input-- Question: Where could you buy an old pie safe with decorative tin? Options: A: shopping bag,B: trash,C: antique store,D: landfill,E: cupboard, Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the speaker is looking for a specific item, an old pie safe with decorative tin. An antique store is a place where one would typically find such an item. The other options, a shopping bag, trash, landfill, and cupboard, do not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- antique store
--input-- Question: Where would you buy an icebox built a hundred years ago? Options: A: kitchen,B: antique store,C: junk yard,D: walmart,E: homes, Knowledge: An icebox built a hundred years ago is considered an antique item, which means it is likely to be sold in an antique store rather than in a regular store or a junkyard. While it is possible that some people may still have an icebox in their homes, it is unlikely that it would be a hundred years old, and it wouldn't be sold in a kitchen or a Walmart. Answer is
--target-- antique store
--input-- Question: A person is traveling to find fine carpeting, where might they go? Options: A: roon,B: home or office,C: rood,D: cub,E: istanbul, Knowledge: Istanbul is known for its rich history of crafting and selling fine carpets.

--target-- istanbul
--input-- Question: He leaned the beam over the flooded gap to create a makeshift what? Options: A: warehouse,B: bridge,C: metal shop,D: shop,E: new construction, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question used a beam to create a temporary structure over a flooded gap. The most logical choice for what he created would be a bridge. The other options, such as warehouse or metal shop, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Shop and new construction are too vague to be the correct choice. Answer is
--target-- bridge
--input-- Question: In what environment would you expect to find a shark? Options: A: sea world,B: deep ocean,C: maritime museum,D: pet store,E: great barrier reef, Knowledge: Sharks are typically found in the open ocean, particularly in deeper waters away from shore. The deep ocean provides a suitable environment for many species of sharks, such as the great white, tiger, and hammerhead sharks. Sea World and maritime museums may have sharks on display, but they are generally not found in these environments naturally. Pet stores would not typically carry sharks, and the Great Barrier Reef is a coral reef ecosystem, not a location commonly associated with sharks, although some species can be found there. Answer is
--target-- deep ocean
--input-- Question: If a person accidentally harms another person, what happens to them? Options: A: live happily,B: work at home,C: catch cold,D: feel ashamed,E: throw a party, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person has accidentally caused harm to another person, which would likely result in feelings of guilt and shame. None of the other answer choices would make sense in this context, as they do not relate to the consequences of accidentally causing harm to someone else. Answer is
--target-- feel ashamed
--input-- Question: There are hundreds of bars and eateries in what east coast metropolis? Options: A: jail,B: michigan,C: nightclub,D: new york city,E: restaurant, Knowledge: The question refers to a large city on the east coast, which narrows down the options to a handful of choices. The options "jail" and "michigan" are unlikely choices for a question about bars and eateries, and "nightclub" and "restaurant" could refer to many cities. However, "new york city" is known for its vast array of bars and restaurants, making it the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- new york city
--input-- Question: What do you do to get ready to compete in body building? Options: A: smart,B: sign up,C: train,D: good at,E: start, Knowledge: Body building is a sport that requires intense physical training and conditioning. Therefore, the answer that best fits the context of the question is "train". This is because preparing to compete in body building involves practicing and perfecting various exercises and techniques to build muscle mass and achieve a defined physique. The other options do not reflect the necessary physical preparation required for body building, such as being "smart" or simply "signing up". Answer is
--target-- train
--input-- Question: She was not lying intentionally, but she had a powerful what? Options: A: duplicitous,B: dishonesty,C: poker face,D: imagination,E: deceitful, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question did not intentionally lie, but still had a powerful quality that could have caused confusion or misunderstanding. The word "imagination" would fit this description, as it suggests that the person may have inadvertently created a false narrative or perception of events due to their creative thinking. The other options all describe deliberate acts of deception or concealment, which do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- imagination
--input-- Question: What must someone purchase if they plan on going to a play? Options: A: tickets,B: having ticket,C: patience,D: time,E: a hat, Knowledge: Going to a play requires a ticket to enter the theater and watch the performance. Without a ticket, one would not be allowed to enter the theater. Patience and time may be required for waiting in line or for the play to start, but they are not necessary to purchase. Having a ticket would make sense grammatically, but it is not a commonly used phrase. A hat also does not have any connection to going to a play. Answer is
--target-- tickets
--input-- Question: A good habit each morning is eating breakfast, but not too much, because then I'd be guilty of what? Options: A: starving,B: heartburn,C: gas,D: overeating,E: being satisfied, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that it is important to eat breakfast in the morning but not too much, implying that there is a risk of eating too much in the morning.

The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- overeating
--input-- Question: I was creating art, what would be my end product? Options: A: controversy,B: communication,C: feeling of accomplishment,D: strong emotion,E: work of art, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker was engaged in the act of creating art, and therefore the end product would likely be a work of art. The other options are either outcomes that could result from creating art or subjective experiences that the creator might have while making art, but they are not the actual end product of the creative process. The end product of creating art is usually a tangible object, such as a painting, sculpture, or photograph. Answer is
--target-- work of art
--input-- Question: Cats always tickle me with their? Options: A: purring,B: four paws,C: four legs,D: two eyes,E: whiskers, Knowledge: The word "tickling" in the sentence suggests a playful or lighthearted interaction. Cats are known for using their whiskers to explore and interact with their environment, which can be playful and ticklish for their human companions. The other options - purring, four paws, four legs, and two eyes - do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- whiskers
--input-- Question: What do all people have at first but later might not have? Options: A: mentality,B: feelings,C: muscles,D: brains,E: parents, Knowledge: The question is asking about something that all people have at first but might not have later in life. The option that fits this criterion is 'parents.' All individuals have parents at birth, but some may lose them due to various reasons such as separation, divorce, or death. The other options such as mentality, feelings, muscles, and brains are not things that people typically lose over time. Answer is
--target-- parents
--input-- Question: When experiencing loneliness who would be a good person to see? Options: A: socialize,B: meet friend,C: make people laugh,D: make friends,E: get fight, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the solution to loneliness involves spending time with someone else. Out of the options, "meet friend" is the best choice as it specifically mentions seeing someone who you already consider a friend. "Socialize" and "make friends" are possible ways to alleviate loneliness, but in this context, they are not as direct as meeting up with someone you already know. "Make people laugh" and "get fight" are unlikely solutions to loneliness and are not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- meet friend
--input-- Question: When getting in shape you need to have this in between workouts? Options: A: give up,B: eat more,C: period of recovery,D: dance,E: jogging, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to get in shape, something is needed in between workouts. This could refer to the fact that the body needs time to rest and recover in order to build muscle and improve fitness. The option "give up" contradicts this idea, while "eat more" may be counterproductive to weight loss goals. "Dance" and "jogging" may be types of workouts, but they do not directly address the need for a period of recovery. Therefore, "period of recovery" is the most appropriate answer. Answer is
--target-- period of recovery
--input-- Question: Why do people like getting wet in the summer? Options: A: get cold,B: relax,C: catching cold,D: catch cold,E: cooling off, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people enjoy getting wet during the summer season. One possible reason for this is to cool off, as water has a cooling effect on the body. The option "get cold" may be the opposite of what people want during a hot summer day. "Relax" could be a possible reason for getting wet, but it does not necessarily explain why people specifically like getting wet in the summer. "Catching cold" and "catch cold" are essentially the same option and do not make sense in this context as they imply getting sick rather than cooling off. Answer is
--target-- cooling off
--input-- Question: Where would you get an eyeglasses case if you do not have one? Options: A: factory,B: bag,C: store,D: purse,E: shirt pocket, Knowledge: The question implies that the person needs to acquire an eyeglasses case, which suggests they do not currently have one. A store is a logical place to look for an eyeglasses case as it is a commonly sold item in stores that sell eyeglasses or accessories. The other options do not seem to be as relevant in this context, as a factory or bag would not necessarily have an eyeglasses case readily available, a purse may or may not be large enough to hold an eyeglasses case, and a shirt pocket may not be a secure or protective enough option for an eyeglasses case. Answer is
--target-- store
--input-- Question: Sweet is a great taste on its own, but it also goes great with what? Options: A: bitter,B: salty,C: dry,D: sour,E: savory, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that sweet has a complementary taste that goes well with another taste. One common pairing is sweet and sour, as found in many dishes like sweet and sour chicken or sweet and sour sauce.

Options: A: county fair,B: stable,C: barnyard,D: sheepfold,E: farmyard, Knowledge: The question implies that the cow getting an award is a significant event, which suggests that it is likely taking place at some kind of competition or exhibition. A county fair is a common event where livestock are showcased and judged, so it is the most likely answer.

Options: A: toilet mug,B: cupboard,C: container,D: supermarket,E: jar, Knowledge: The question asks for a suitable place to store leftover soup, which suggests that the correct answer needs to be a container or receptacle of some sort. A toilet mug or supermarket are clearly inappropriate options, and a jar may not be large enough to hold the soup.

The options battleship, airplane cabin, and military do not involve sports, so they can be eliminated.

Options: A: bread,B: countryside,C: the forest,D: mill,E: farmer's field, Knowledge: Wheat is a type of crop that is typically grown in open fields, particularly in rural areas where agriculture is common.

"Money" implies a transactional relationship, which again doesn't fit with the idea of serving customers. Answer is
--target-- help

The other options do not make much sense in the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- stairwell

Options: A: urban area,B: home,C: town,D: rooms,E: office, Knowledge: The word "rapid" suggests that the question is asking about a place where construction is happening quickly or on a large scale.

Options: A: cheat,B: fair,C: sabotage,D: practice,E: in competition, Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is asking for a legitimate and ethical way to improve one's chances of winning in a competition. Cheating and sabotage are unethical and would not result in a genuine victory. Fairness is a basic expectation but does not provide any useful tips for winning. "In competition" is not a specific action that one can take to improve their chances of winning. Practicing, on the other hand, is a well-known way to improve one's skills and increase their chances of success in a competition. Answer is

The context implies that the treats were not simply for pleasure, but for a specific purpose. The options "two eyes," "four legs," and "two ears" are irrelevant to the context and do not make sense in relation to the sentence.

As a result, it can be inferred that her weight would likely decrease if she continued to eat less of these types of foods.

Answer is

The option "countryside" also suggests this, as farms are often located in rural areas. The other options, such as "fairgrounds" and "on the moon," have no connection to the context of the sentence and can be disregarded. "Give birth to dogs" is also an absurd option that does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- farmyard

Options: A: hair salon,B: small town,C: shopping mall,D: village,E: city, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the barbershop is located within a larger structure that houses multiple stores.

--target-- names
--input-- Question: Where would green beans be found directly before eating? Options: A: bathroom,B: plate,C: container,D: farmer's market,E: mouth, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the green beans are being prepared for consumption, which means they would likely be placed on a plate before being eaten. The other options, such as the bathroom or container, do not make sense in this context. The farmer's market may be where the green beans were purchased, but it is not directly connected to the act of eating them. The mouth is where the beans end up, not where they are found before eating. Answer is
--target-- plate

Additionally, the mention of heading somewhere suggests that the person is looking for a specific location or type of store, and a department store is a common location for purchasing gifts due to its wide range of products. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well, as a christmas tree and stocking are not places to buy gifts, and a specialty store may not carry a widely popular gift item.

This occurs when the stomach stretches to accommodate the food and sends signals to the brain that it is time to stop eating. The other options, such as weight gain, nausea, and upset stomach, are unlikely to be associated with a feeling of pleasantness or satisfaction after a meal. "Not hungry" is also not the best option since it does not describe a pleasant sensation, but rather a lack of appetite. Answer is
--target-- feeling of fullness

Options: A: boredom,B: chores,C: allergies,D: pain and suffering,E: cleanliness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teen wanted to impress his girlfriend by doing housework, so the answer must be related to the concept of housework. The option "boredom" does not make sense as something that impresses someone, while "chores" is too general and does not differentiate the teen's actions from regular housework. "Allergies" and "pain and suffering" are negative experiences that the girlfriend is unlikely to be impressed by.

The other options (home, under the cow) are not relevant to the context of being at school. The option "menu" may be helpful in finding out if milk is available in the cafeteria, but it does not provide a direct answer to the question. "Accompaniment to meal" is also not specific enough, as there may be other options besides milk that are served with meals. Answer is

While some people may feel excited about the prospect of making new friends, the question specifies "most people," so this option is less likely to be the correct answer.

Options: A: hang out at bar,B: running,C: drink alcohol,D: clean house,E: dream, Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a way to relieve stress with friends, and hanging out at a bar with friends is a common activity that can help to relieve stress.

Drinking alcohol may initially relieve stress, but can ultimately make the problem worse in the long run. Cleaning the house and dreaming are not social activities that involve being with friends. Answer is

Options: A: city,B: rural countryside,C: bowling alley,D: highway,E: estonia, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that small unpaved lanes can be found somewhere, and the options given provide different locations where they might be found. A city is unlikely to have many small unpaved lanes, as most streets in a city are paved. A bowling alley is an indoor location and has nothing to do with small unpaved lanes. Highways are large and often paved, so they are not likely to have small unpaved lanes either. Estonia is a country and not a location where small unpaved lanes might be found.

Options: A: library,B: building,C: kitchen,D: phone booth,E: front desk, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was contacting the management of a skyscraper, which indicates that the person is likely in or near the building. The choices "library," "kitchen," and "phone booth" are unlikely options for finding a telephone directory related to the building, while "front desk" may be a possibility but not as specific as "building."

Options: A: bad movie,B: pool hall,C: bathtub,D: outside,E: marine museum, Knowledge: The question specifically asks about where you can learn about marine animals such as sharks, whales, and dolphins. A marine museum is a facility that is dedicated to showcasing marine life and educating the public about the world's oceans.

"Outside" is too broad a category and could refer to anything from a park to a desert. Answer is
--target-- marine museum

Options: A: beehive,B: porch,C: post office,D: apartment building,E: front door, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the structure being referred to contains multiple homes and has a communal area where a mailbox can be found. The options "beehive" and "porch" do not fit this description, while "post office" would not typically contain multiple homes. "Front door" is too vague and could apply to any building. "Apartment building" is the most likely option that fits the description given in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- apartment building
--input-- Question: Jane goes out the door to find outside a bright object, what is she looking for? Options: A: moon,B: ground,C: sun,D: nature,E: sky, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Jane sees a bright object outside, which is most likely the sun. The sun is a bright object that can be easily seen outside during daylight hours, whereas the moon is typically visible at night. The ground and nature do not necessarily have any association with a bright object, and the sky is too general of a term to indicate any specific object. Answer is
--target-- sun
--input-- Question: The only place you'd find a marmoset in what gold rush region would be in a zoo? Options: A: in wild,B: your moms house,C: burrow,D: american west,E: national park, Knowledge: The sentence implies that marmosets are not native to the American West, and the only place to find them would be in a zoo. This implies that they may be found in the wild in other regions, such as in South America where they are commonly found. The other options do not provide any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- american west

Options: A: orchestra,B: music store,C: band,D: eating,E: piano store, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the keyboard instrument was being played onstage alongside the drums and guitar, which is commonly associated with bands.

--target-- band

Options: A: concretely,B: permanent,C: remain stable,D: stagnant,E: constant, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is looking for a change that is lasting and will not be easily undone. The word "permanent" means lasting or enduring, which fits with the man's desire for a long-term change in his life. The other options do not convey the same sense of lasting change; "concretely" and "constant" refer to the manner or nature of the change, while "remain stable" and "stagnant" suggest a lack of change altogether. Answer is
--target-- permanent
--input-- Question: James loves judging things, but all he has to go on is his own what? Options: A: misperception,B: jury,C: knowing yourself,D: ignorance,E: experience, Explanation: The sentence suggests that James enjoys being a judge, but he only has his own perspective to base his judgments on. This implies that James is relying on his personal experience to make judgments, rather than relying on external sources of information. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence in the same way - misperception suggests that James may be making incorrect judgments, knowing yourself implies a level of self-awareness that is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence, ignorance suggests a lack of knowledge or understanding, and a jury would imply a group of people rather than an individual perspective. Answer is
--target-- experience
--input-- Question: How does someone go about getting in shape? Options: A: losing weight,B: sweat,C: triangle,D: good health,E: exercise, Knowledge: The term "getting in shape" typically refers to improving one's overall physical fitness, which involves engaging in regular physical activity or exercise. While losing weight may be a goal for some people, it is not the only way to get in shape. Sweat may be a byproduct of exercise, but it does not directly contribute to getting in shape. The triangle and good health do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- exercise

Options: A: growing mold,B: moving,C: accent garden,D: green,E: painting, Knowledge: The tourists initially mistook the artwork for a statue, which suggests that it was a realistic representation of something. However, the sentence indicates that the artwork began "moving", which implies that it was actually a performance rather than a static sculpture. The other options (growing mold, accent garden, green, painting) do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- moving
--input-- Question: What can you stick a key in? Options: A: pocket,B: bus depot,C: front door,D: purse,E: roof, Knowledge: The phrase "stick a key in" implies that the object being referred to has a keyhole, which is commonly found on front doors of houses and buildings.

Options: A: opinion,B: eat cake,C: untrue,D: belief,E: factfile, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that both sides were presenting their arguments as facts, despite the fact that neither side had evidence to support their claims.

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- opinion

Options: A: meditate,B: medicated,C: confusion,D: epilepsy,E: hallucination, Knowledge: Going into trance can be associated with altered states of consciousness that can lead to hallucinations. Hallucinations involve seeing or perceiving things that are not present in reality, and can occur as a result of various factors including drug use, mental illness, or neurological conditions. Meditating can induce altered states of consciousness but not necessarily hallucinations. Being medicated or confused also do not necessarily lead to hallucinations. Epilepsy can cause seizures but not necessarily hallucinations. Answer is
--target-- hallucination

Options: A: headaches,B: enjoyment,C: riots,D: intimacy,E: ocean, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple is alone and that it's time for a more private activity after a day of celebrating their marriage. "Intimacy" is a word that commonly refers to physical closeness and affection between romantic partners, which would be an appropriate activity for a newlywed couple who are alone together. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "headaches" and "riots" are negative events and "ocean" is unrelated to the situation. "Enjoyment" could be a possible answer, but it is too general and doesn't give any specific information about what the couple will be doing. Answer is
--target-- intimacy

Options: A: true,B: just,C: badarse,D: trashy,E: prime, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a specific time of day when networks air their most popular bad shows, and the word "prime" is commonly used to describe this time. "Prime time" typically refers to the hours between 8pm and 11pm when television networks air their most popular shows. The other options, such as "true," "just," "badarse," and "trashy," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Options: A: trash,B: parcel,C: junk drawer,D: envelope,E: desk drawer, Knowledge: Spare address labels are a commonly used office supply item that is generally stored in a convenient location that is easily accessible.

Answer is
--target-- desk drawer
--input-- Question: Where can a calendar be purchased normally? Options: A: office supply store,B: desktop,C: smart phone,D: wrist watch,E: date book, Knowledge: The question asks where a calendar can be purchased "normally," which suggests that it is referring to a physical paper-based calendar rather than a digital one. Office supply stores are a common place to purchase paper-based calendars since they often sell a variety of office and organizational supplies. The other options (desktop, smartphone, wrist watch, and date book) are all digital or non-paper options for keeping track of dates and appointments. Answer is
--target-- office supply store

Options: A: headache,B: better understanding,C: papercuts,D: enlightened,E: discovering truth, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James did not benefit from analyzing all the data, and that it only resulted in a negative outcome. The word "headache" implies that James found the process of analyzing the data to be frustrating or overwhelming, and that it did not lead to any useful insights or better understanding. The other options do not fit with the negative tone of the sentence or suggest a beneficial outcome. Answer is

Options: A: bedroom,B: bathroom,C: book store,D: library,E: furniture store, Knowledge: A bookshelf is typically used to store books or other items, and it is usually found in a room where people read or work. Among the options, the bedroom is the most likely place where a person would have a small bookshelf. This is because many people like to read in bed or have books nearby as they wind down for the night. The bathroom is not a common place for a bookshelf, and neither is a book store or furniture store. While a library would have many bookshelves, it is not a personal location where someone would have their own small bookshelf. Answer is
--target-- bedroom
--input-- Question: If you have some excess corn, where would you put it? Options: A: silo,B: storage building,C: restaurant,D: pennsylvania,E: supermarket, Knowledge: Corn is a crop commonly stored in silos, which are tall cylindrical structures designed for storing grains and other agricultural products. Silos protect the corn from moisture, pests, and other elements, helping to preserve the quality of the crop. The other options are unlikely places to store excess corn, as a storage building may not be designed for grains, a restaurant does not typically store raw ingredients, Pennsylvania is a geographic location, and a supermarket typically purchases corn from suppliers rather than storing excess crops. Answer is
--target-- silo
--input-- Question: If something isn't plain but has adornments, what is it called? Options: A: bells and whistles,B: fancy,C: exotic,D: decorative,E: extravagant, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being described has additional adornments or decorations, which makes the option "decorative" the correct answer. The other options are more closely associated with extravagance or excess, rather than simply having adornments. For example, "bells and whistles" suggests that the object has many unnecessary features, while "extravagant" implies that it is luxurious or excessive. "Fancy" and "exotic" can both suggest a sense of uniqueness, but do not necessarily imply additional decorations or adornments. Answer is
--target-- decorative

Options: A: on time,B: pollution,C: death,D: sickness,E: run out of gas, Knowledge: The question asks for a possible reason why a driving car might stop, and one common reason is running out of gas. This occurs when the fuel level in the car's tank reaches zero, causing the engine to stop. The other choices are not relevant to the context of a car stopping while driving. "On time" and "pollution" are not causes of a car stopping, while "death" and "sickness" refer to human conditions that would not affect a car. Answer is
--target-- run out of gas
--input-- Question: Debbie noticed that there was a ficus decorating the room while she was getting a perm.  Where was this plant? Options: A: arboretum,B: hair salon,C: family room,D: flower garden,E: in the sink, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Debbie was getting a perm when she noticed the ficus, which implies that she was in a place where people go to get their hair done, such as a hair salon. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. An arboretum is a place where one would go to see many different types of plants, a family room would typically not have a plant as part of its decor, and a flower garden would not commonly have a ficus tree growing in it. The option "in the sink" is clearly not a valid choice given the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- hair salon
--input-- Question: The tree wanted to grow more, but in the garden why did the roots stop spreading? Options: A: affected by weather,B: wall in,C: grow tall,D: burn,E: hatred, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tree is unable to spread its roots further, which implies a physical barrier preventing it from doing so. The option "wall in" is the only one that refers to a physical obstruction that could limit root growth in a garden. The other options, such as weather, growth patterns, and emotions, do not provide any explanation for why the tree's roots would stop spreading. Answer is
--target-- wall in
--input-- Question: What are people more likely to do when they drink alcohol at a bar? Options: A: dance,B: become inebriated,C: urinate,D: sleep at night,E: socialize, Knowledge: Drinking alcohol at a bar is typically associated with socializing with friends or meeting new people. Dancing may also be popular, but it is not the most common activity associated with drinking at a bar. Becoming inebriated, urinating, and sleeping at night are negative outcomes of drinking too much alcohol and do not necessarily reflect what people are more likely to do when they drink at a bar. Answer is
--target-- socialize
--input-- Question: The baby came unexpectedly, what did it do? Options: A: died,B: boy or girl,C: learn to walk,D: talk nonsense,E: arrive early, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the baby arrived unexpectedly, meaning it was not due at that time. Therefore, the correct answer would be "arrive early." The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Died" is too extreme and not indicated by the sentence. "Boy or girl" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence, and the baby's gender is not mentioned. "Learn to walk" is not something a baby would do immediately after being born. "Talk nonsense" is unlikely for a newborn baby. Answer is
--target-- arrive early
--input-- Question: They had to take the motorway and famous turnpike to get to the even MTV-made famous shore, where were they? Options: A: race track,B: new jersey,C: usa,D: england,E: city, Knowledge: The sentence mentions the "MTV-made famous shore", which is a reference to the reality TV show "Jersey Shore". The show was set in New Jersey, specifically in the town of Seaside Heights, which is known for its beach and boardwalk. The sentence also mentions "the motorway and famous turnpike", which are both major highways in the northeastern United States, particularly in New Jersey. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

--input-- Question: How can you get rid of anger? Options: A: write letter,B: release energy,C: scream,D: pass sentence,E: punch, Knowledge: Anger is often associated with built-up energy or tension in the body, so releasing that energy can be an effective way to manage it. This can be done through physical exercise, such as going for a run or doing yoga, or engaging in activities that help release pent-up emotion, such as hitting a pillow or screaming into a pillow. Writing a letter or punching something may provide temporary relief, but they don't address the root cause of the anger or help release the energy associated with it. Passing a sentence has no clear connection to managing anger. Answer is
--target-- release energy
--input-- Question: What will happen to you if your need is met? Options: A: unhappy,B: sufficient,C: wants,D: satisfied,E: unnecessary, Knowledge: The word "need" implies that there is something that the individual lacks or requires in order to feel complete or whole. When a need is fulfilled, the person is likely to feel satisfied, as their requirement has been met. The other options do not necessarily indicate a positive or negative outcome, and they do not specifically address the idea of having a need met. Answer is
--target-- satisfied
--input-- Question: James noticed that people who communicate well have fewer problems.  Some people communicate easily with strangers, others need to talk with members of their own groups.  A religion is a type of group.  What do members of a religion have in common? Options: A: believe in god,B: talk to each other,C: pay bills,D: learn from each other,E: believe in ghosts, Knowledge: The question suggests that religion is a type of group, and the sentence also mentions that communicating with members of one's own group is important for good communication skills. Additionally, the question specifically asks what members of a religion have in common. The most central and defining characteristic of a religion is belief in a higher power or deity, usually referred to as God. Therefore, the answer is likely "believe in god." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question or the characteristics of religion. Answer is
--target-- believe in god

Options: A: eaten,B: bbq,C: fast food restaurant,D: plate,E: pizza, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that you can get chicken without leaving your car, which is a common feature of fast food restaurants with drive-thru windows. "BBQ" and "pizza" may also be available at some fast food restaurants, but the sentence specifically refers to chicken. "Plate" is not a location where you can get food, and "eaten" does not make sense in the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- fast food restaurant
--input-- Question: The person looked lustfully into his girlfriend's eyes, what did he want to do? Options: A: fight,B: thank god,C: sun himself,D: race against time,E: express love, Knowledge: The adverb "lustfully" suggests that the person's gaze was driven by desire, and the fact that the object of the gaze was the person's girlfriend suggests a romantic or sexual attraction. The phrase "looked into his girlfriend's eyes" can imply intimacy, and the use of the verb "express" in the last option reinforces the idea that the person wanted to communicate their feelings to their partner. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- express love

Options: A: strong odor,B: age well,C: salad dressing,D: flavor,E: age to get better, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the cheese needs to be left in the cellar for a few years, which suggests that the cheese needs time to mature or age in order to improve its flavor.

--target-- age to get better

--target-- sink

Row houses are commonly found in older cities like London, which is located in England. The word "foggy" further supports this idea, as London is famous for its foggy weather. The other options, such as city center, cheap living, ghetto, and jars, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

The options "mail," "shoe store," and "warehouse" do not fit this context, as they are not typically places where families store their possessions.

Options: A: imperfect,B: disfigured,C: damaged,D: flawed,E: defective, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the painter struggled to create a perfect portrait, which implies that he perceived the subjects he painted as imperfect in some way. The word "imperfect" describes a subject that has flaws or is not ideal, which fits the context of the sentence.

Answer is
--target-- imperfect

Typically, if someone is driving faster than the speed limit, they are at a risk of getting a speeding ticket, which is a form of fine or penalty imposed for excessive speed while driving.

Options: A: have talent,B: climb stairs,C: in play,D: crawl,E: teach, Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that there is a stage that is elevated, which suggests that the only logical option is to climb stairs to reach the stage. Having talent or teaching have no relation to the physical act of accessing an elevated stage, while crawling would not be appropriate for someone who needs to go on stage. In play is also unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- climb stairs
--input-- Question: What do you receive a new credit card in? Options: A: wallet,B: resturant,C: wallet,D: envelope,E: purse, Knowledge: When receiving a new credit card, it is typically mailed to the recipient in a protective envelope for security purposes.

Options: A: indiana,B: new jersey,C: england,D: race track,E: patina, Knowledge: The clue in the sentence is "watching some car drive in circles," which suggests that the activity they are going to watch is a car race.

The other options are locations or words that do not have any clear connection to car racing, so they can be eliminated. Answer is
--target-- race track

Options: A: forest,B: paint store,C: house,D: neighbor's house,E: windows, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple is trying to find a new match for the old wall color, which implies that they are looking for a place that sells paint.

Options: A: basement,B: universe,C: amazonia,D: forest,E: tropical jungle, Knowledge: Sloths are known to be arboreal animals that primarily inhabit trees in tropical environments. Tropical jungles are known for their dense vegetation and diverse wildlife, making it an ideal habitat for a variety of animals, including sloths. The other options, such as basement and universe, are not realistic habitats for sloths, while Amazonia and forest are too broad and do not provide enough specific information to choose as the answer. Answer is
--target-- tropical jungle
--input-- Question: A monkey ran through La Defense with classified documents, who was chasing it? Options: A: monkey,B: rain forest,C: captivity,D: madagascar,E: french government, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the monkey had classified documents, which means they were most likely stolen from a government organization. The mention of La Defense also implies a location in France, which supports the idea that the French government was chasing the monkey to retrieve the documents. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- french government
--input-- Question: What could snoring cause in rare cases? Options: A: complaining,B: an upset partner,C: disturbed sleep,D: loud noise,E: death, Knowledge: The question asks about rare consequences of snoring, so the answer is unlikely to be something commonly associated with snoring such as complaining or an upset partner. Snoring can cause disturbed sleep and loud noise, but these are not rare consequences. However, in rare cases, snoring can be a symptom of a more serious condition such as sleep apnea, which can cause death if left untreated. Answer is
--target-- death
--input-- Question: The shark was navigating across from the African coast to New York, where was it? Options: A: bathtub,B: seawater,C: atlantic ocean,D: saltwater,E: sea world, Knowledge: The sentence mentions the shark navigating from the African coast to New York, which suggests that it was traveling across a large body of water. The options "bathtub" and "sea world" are unrealistic as they do not provide enough space for a shark to navigate through. "Seawater" and "saltwater" are properties of the ocean, but do not provide information about the location. "Atlantic ocean" is the most relevant option as it is a large body of water that connects Africa to the United States, which matches the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- atlantic ocean
--input-- Question: The planned sky scraper was still years away from completion, but excavation had begun where? Options: A: cemetary,B: mountain,C: desert,D: construction site,E: archeological site, Knowledge: The phrase "planned skyscraper" suggests that construction of a tall building is in progress. The word "excavation" implies that some work is being done at the site to prepare for construction. The only option that refers to a location where construction work is typically carried out is "construction site." The other options - cemetery, mountain, desert, and archeological site - do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not typically associated with building construction. Answer is
--target-- construction site
--input-- Question: Why would someone think about getting wet in the summer? Options: A: cool off,B: to have fun,C: shrinkage,D: shrinking,E: get cold, Knowledge: Summer is typically associated with hot weather, so if someone is thinking about getting wet during this season, it is likely because they want to cool off. Swimming, water parks, and other water-related activities are popular ways to beat the heat in the summer. The other options, such as shrinking or getting cold, do not make sense in the context of summer and getting wet. Answer is
--target-- cool off
--input-- Question: A cat can't talk, but a cat can what? Options: A: sleep all day,B: meow,C: shed fur,D: see king,E: live many years, Knowledge: The sentence states that a cat cannot talk, but then suggests that a cat can do something else. One option that cats are well-known for is meowing, which is a sound they use to communicate with humans and other cats. Meowing is a distinctive characteristic of cats and is therefore the correct answer. The other options, while true for cats, do not specifically relate to the sentence's context, making them incorrect answers. Answer is
--target-- meow
--input-- Question: The ability to remember things is a sign of what? Options: A: neuronal network,B: memories,C: intelligence,D: recall,E: learning about, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that remembering things is a characteristic associated with a certain trait. Intelligence is commonly associated with the ability to remember things because it involves having a sharp mind and quick thinking. Neuronal network and memories are more specific and do not have a direct correlation to the sentence. Recall and learning about are more focused on the process of remembering rather than the trait itself. Answer is
--target-- intelligence
--input-- Question: In America, the courthouse of any given town has a likely location, where is it? Options: A: electrical circuit,B: getting married,C: capital city,D: center of town,E: michigan, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a specific location where the courthouse of any given town in America is typically located. Since courthouses are typically considered central institutions in any town or city, the answer that best fits the context of the sentence is the "center of town." The other options, such as an "electrical circuit," "getting married," "capital city," and "Michigan" do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- center of town

Options: A: at a,B: movie theatre,C: clerk,D: metro station,E: sports arena, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the football fans were trying to purchase tickets, which would typically be sold at a venue that hosts sports events. This description matches the option "sports arena," which is a place specifically designed for sports events and ticket sales. The other options, such as a movie theatre, clerk, or metro station, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- sports arena
--input-- Question: You think of lower areas when it comes to a valley, but they're usually just a lower spot in a what? Options: A: continent,B: west virginia,C: peak,D: mountainous region,E: hilly area, Knowledge: Valleys are typically formed by the erosion or shifting of larger landforms such as mountains or hills. Therefore, it is more likely that a valley would be situated in a mountainous region rather than in a hilly area or a continent. West Virginia may have some mountainous regions, but it is not a general characteristic of the entire state. A peak, on the other hand, refers to the highest point of a mountain and is not usually associated with valleys. Answer is
--target-- mountainous region
--input-- Question: What can happen if you're too worn out before going to opera? Options: A: jump,B: fresh,C: fall asleep,D: headache,E: relaxation, Knowledge: The context suggests that the consequence of being too worn out before going to the opera is related to fatigue, which typically leads to feeling sleepy or nodding off during the performance.

Options: A: crowding,B: wonder,C: being bored,D: fear,E: sore feet, Knowledge: When visiting a museum, children are likely to experience wonder and amazement at the various exhibits and artifacts on display. Museums are designed to be educational and engaging, so it is common for children to be fascinated by what they see. Crowding and sore feet may be unpleasant experiences in a museum environment, but they are not necessarily specific to children. Being bored and fearful may also occur, but wonder is the most likely and positive experience for a child visiting a museum. Answer is
--target-- wonder
--input-- Question: From where can you learn the anatomy of a blowfish? Options: A: atlantic ocean,B: france,C: fish market,D: books,E: sushi restaurant, Knowledge: The question is asking about how to learn the anatomy of a blowfish, which suggests that it may be a topic covered in educational resources such as books. While it is possible to observe a blowfish in its natural habitat in the Atlantic Ocean or at a fish market, these options do not necessarily guarantee a thorough understanding of its anatomy. France and sushi restaurants are not relevant to the context of the question. Therefore, books would be the best option for gaining knowledge about the anatomy of a blowfish. Answer is
--target-- books
--input-- Question: What does a person do when something is arriving at an undisclosed time? Options: A: washing dishes,B: wait patiently,C: stand erect,D: cross street,E: waiting room, Knowledge: The phrase "undisclosed time" suggests that the person does not know when the arrival will happen. Therefore, the only logical choice would be to wait patiently. Washing dishes and standing erect are unrelated to the context of waiting for an arrival. Crossing the street is also unlikely to be the correct answer as it does not involve waiting. Waiting room could be a possible answer, but it is less specific and may not be the best fit depending on the context. Answer is
--target-- wait patiently
--input-- Question: Inside what structure do you normally take a bath? Options: A: room that is upstairs,B: own home,C: hotel room,D: house,E: found in house, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity of taking a bath typically occurs inside a specific type of structure. The options "room that is upstairs," "hotel room," and "found in house" are too vague and do not suggest a clear structure type. "Own home" is similar to "house," but could refer to other living arrangements like apartments. "House" is the most accurate answer, as it specifically refers to a type of building where people typically live and have a bathroom for bathing. Answer is
--target-- house
--input-- Question: John knew that the snake probably wasn't real because he lived in the Midwest, and anacondas live in what regions? Options: A: nightmare,B: wyoming,C: tropics,D: ditch,E: pet shops, Knowledge: The sentence implies that John was able to identify that the snake he encountered was not real based on his knowledge of where anacondas can be found. Anacondas are typically found in tropical regions such as South America, which is likely why John knew that it was unlikely to find one in the Midwest. The other options do not provide any relevant information about anacondas or their habitat. Answer is
--target-- tropics
--input-- Question: The hobbit was timid in front of the dragon, but what did he have to be to get the gold? Options: A: mean,B: aggressive,C: bellicose,D: reckless,E: dauntless, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hobbit was facing a challenge or danger, which required him to possess a certain quality to be able to succeed. The word "timid" implies that he may have lacked courage or confidence initially, but to get the gold, he would need to be bold and fearless, hence the correct answer is "dauntless". The other answer choices have negative connotations, such as being mean or reckless, which are unlikely to be desirable traits in this context. Answer is
--target-- dauntless
--input-- Question: What could someone who give assistance help someone else to be? Options: A: prepared,B: assistant,C: helpful,D: listen,E: help one, Knowledge: The question asks what someone who gives assistance could help someone else to be. The word "assistance" implies that the helper is providing support or aid to the person being helped. The word "prepared" fits this context, as someone who gives assistance could help another person to be prepared for a task or situation. The other answer choices are either synonyms or related to the concept of assistance, but they do not directly answer the question of what someone who gives assistance could help someone else to be. Answer is
--target-- prepared
--input-- Question: What happens to most living things after death but not to mummies? Options: A: rebirth,B: last forever,C: sadness,D: burial,E: decomposition, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that mummies do not undergo the same process as most other living things after death. Decomposition is a common process that occurs when a living thing dies, but it is unlikely to occur in mummies because they are preserved through various methods. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- decomposition
--input-- Question: John was in a ship.  It began taking water.  He was worried because the ship might do what? Options: A: sink,B: glass,C: fly,D: ocean,E: surface of earth, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ship was taking in water, which is a clear sign that it may sink. Glass, fly, ocean, and surface of earth are not connected to the context of the sentence and are therefore not logical choices for the answer. Answer is
--target-- sink
--input-- Question: James enjoys socializing with people, but sometimes he hates the what? Options: A: having fun,B: jealousy,C: love,D: conflicts,E: friendships, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James likes being around people, but there is something that he doesn't like that may arise from socializing. The word "conflicts" is the only option that fits the context of socializing with others but can lead to negative experiences. The other options, such as having fun, jealousy, love, and friendships, do not necessarily imply negative experiences or conflicts. Answer is
--target-- conflicts

Options: A: liquor store,B: church,C: museum,D: spaghetti sauce,E: art show, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is discussing a secret ingredient in a food item being eaten at the table, specifically noodles. As the other options do not involve food or cooking, it can be deduced that the correct answer must be related to food. Additionally, the mention of "wine" as the secret ingredient could indicate that the correct answer involves a savory or Italian cuisine, suggesting that "spaghetti sauce" is the most logical choice. Answer is
--target-- spaghetti sauce
--input-- Question: Where is the best place to get cheese? Options: A: the moon,B: fridge,C: market,D: pizza,E: refrigerator, Knowledge: Out of all the choices, only "market" is a place where one can reasonably expect to find a variety of different cheeses for sale. "The moon" is obviously not a practical option, "fridge" and "refrigerator" are household appliances rather than locations, and "pizza" is a food item that may or may not happen to have cheese on it. Therefore, the correct answer is "market" as it is the only option that aligns with the question asked. Answer is
--target-- market
--input-- Question: A projectile ball is in what after being launched? Options: A: catapult,B: motion,C: flintlock,D: arcade,E: tennis court, Knowledge: The word "launched" suggests that the ball was thrown or propelled forward, and it is logical that it would be in motion after being launched. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A catapult is a device used to launch objects, but the sentence suggests that the ball has already been launched. A flintlock is a type of firearm, which does not fit with the description of a projectile ball. Arcade and tennis court are not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- motion
--input-- Question: She was very saddened about the condition of the person, it was who she most what? Options: A: own house,B: care about,C: basement,D: know everything,E: spare time, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was in a sad and concerning state, indicating that the subject cares deeply about this person's well-being.

The other options do not fit the emotional tone of the sentence or make logical sense in the context provided. Answer is
--target-- care about

Options: A: make baskets,B: dribbling,C: sweat,D: fall down,E: work together, Knowledge: When playing basketball for a long period of time, the physical exertion is likely to cause sweat, which can cover one's shirt. "Make baskets" and "dribbling" are actions related to playing basketball, but do not have any connection to clothing. "Fall down" is a possible result of playing basketball, but does not refer to anything specific happening to one's shirt. "Work together" is also not related to the physical aspect of playing basketball. Answer is
--target-- sweat
--input-- Question: A divider is used to create cubicles in what space? Options: A: notebook,B: kitchen,C: office suite,D: living room,E: math class, Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that a divider is being used in a professional setting to create individual workspaces. An office suite is a common term used to describe a group of offices or workspaces used by one company or organization, whereas the other options do not necessarily have a connection to using dividers to create cubicles in a workspace. Answer is
--target-- office suite
--input-- Question: Billy was cogitating the situation, but soon he would have to come to what? Options: A: decision,B: enlightenment,C: new thoughts,D: headaches,E: annurism, Knowledge: The word "cogitating" means that Billy is thinking deeply or pondering something. The sentence suggests that he will eventually have to make a decision about the situation he is thinking about. The option "enlightenment" may be a possible choice but it is not consistent with the idea of coming to a decision. "New thoughts" and "headaches" are not logical choices, and "annurism" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- decision
--input-- Question: She wants authentic barbecue while visiting southeast Michigan, where should she look? Options: A: retail store,B: garage,C: australia,D: park,E: detroit, Knowledge: The question asks for a location in southeast Michigan where the person can find authentic barbecue, which is a type of food commonly associated with Southern American cuisine.

Therefore, it is the most likely location for the person to find authentic barbecue while visiting southeast Michigan. Answer is
--target-- detroit

--target-- void
--input-- Question: Where must a car park be? Options: A: city,B: shopping centre,C: downtown,D: outside,E: city center, Knowledge: The word "park" suggests that this question is asking about where to park a car, not where to find a car. The word "outside" is the only option that makes sense in this context, as car parks are typically located outside of buildings or in designated parking areas on the sides of streets. The other options may have parking areas, but they do not make sense in the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- outside
--input-- Question: If you're late getting to work, what is something you experience? Options: A: promotions,B: malaise,C: bad mood,D: upset,E: stress, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you are late getting to work, you will experience a negative feeling or emotion. The other options, such as promotions and malaise, do not make sense in the context of being late for work. Bad mood and upset are possible options, but stress is the most common and well-known emotion associated with being late for work. Stress is a feeling of pressure or tension that can result from being behind schedule or missing deadlines. Answer is
--target-- stress
--input-- Question: What should be done with old newspapers? Options: A: written on paper,B: informative but often biased,C: delivered,D: recycled,E: printed on paper, Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the focus is on the proper disposal of old newspapers. Recycling is a common and environmentally friendly way to dispose of paper products such as newspapers. The other options aren't related to the proper disposal of old newspapers - "written on paper" refers to the medium used for writing, "informative but often biased" is a description of the content of newspapers, "delivered" refers to the means by which newspapers are distributed, and "printed on paper" is a description of the physical nature of newspapers, but doesn't suggest any particular method of disposal. Answer is
--target-- recycled

Options: A: block,B: defend,C: surrender,D: retreat,E: cease fire, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the game involves turns, which suggests that it is some sort of strategy or combat game. The first player attacks, which means that the second player must defend against the attack. Block and defend are similar in meaning, but block may imply a more active action, while defend is more passive. Surrender, retreat, and cease fire all suggest ending the game or giving up, which is not consistent with the context of taking turns and attacking/defending. Answer is
--target-- defend

Options: A: envelope,B: help person track expenses,C: floor,D: wallet,E: purse, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that loose credit cards are being thrown into a container of some sort, and the most likely container for loose credit cards for women would be their purse. Envelopes are usually used to send letters or documents, and are not typically used to store credit cards. While a help person may help someone track expenses, it is unlikely that credit cards would be thrown at them. A floor is not a container and would not be a logical place for storing credit cards. Wallets are typically used to store credit cards, but the context of the sentence suggests that the cards are loose and not organized in a wallet. Answer is
--target-- purse

This group would be called "undecided." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "reject" suggests a negative decision, "predetermination" suggests a decision already made, "force" is not related to decision-making, and "blank" is not commonly used to refer to people who have not made a choice. Answer is
--target-- undecided
--input-- Question: What would you put on your foot first before anything else?

--input-- Question: Where would you be unlikely to find more than one steak house? Options: A: nebraska,B: utah,C: new york,D: city,E: strip mall, Knowledge: The term "steak house" typically refers to a restaurant that specializes in serving steak, which is a type of meat often associated with high-end dining. However, strip malls are known for having a variety of small storefronts that cater to a wide range of consumer needs, often including fast food and casual dining options. Therefore, it is unlikely that a strip mall would have more than one steak house, as it would not necessarily be the ideal location for this type of fine dining establishment to succeed. The other options are all locations where one might reasonably expect to find multiple steak houses, depending on the size of the city or the preferences of the local population. Answer is
--target-- strip mall

--input-- Question: If a frog has to travel a short distance on land it will do what? Options: A: walk,B: jump several feet,C: swim,D: hop,E: leap, Knowledge: Frogs are known to move on land by hopping, which involves pushing off the ground with their back legs and landing on their front legs. Jumping several feet is unlikely since frogs are not capable of sustained flight. Swimming is how frogs move through water, not on land. Leaping is similar to jumping and also unlikely for a short distance. Walking is not a typical form of movement for frogs as their legs are adapted for jumping and hopping in water and on land. Answer is
--target-- hop

Options: A: critical thinking,B: congratulated,C: kick him,D: equal opportunity,E: own house, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person achieved a positive outcome and was recognized by their peers in response. The word "congratulated" suggests that they were praised or acknowledged for their achievement, which is a common response to success.

--target-- congratulated
--input-- Question: The chain kept coming off of Bill's bike.  Because of this, you couldn't use what? Options: A: gear shift,B: wheels,C: garage,D: hardware store,E: motorbike, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is an issue with the chain on Bill's bike, which is likely affecting the function of the bike. The gear shift is a crucial part of the bike that allows the rider to change gears and adjust their speed. If the chain keeps coming off, it's likely that the gear shift is not able to function properly, which would make it difficult to use. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- gear shift

Options: A: student,B: leave home,C: register,D: see work,E: old enough, Knowledge: Admissions counselors are responsible for evaluating students' readiness for school based on a variety of factors, including age.

The other options do not necessarily relate to the admissions process or age requirements for starting school. Answer is
--target-- old enough

--input-- Question: What does someone do before they travel to work? Options: A: wake up,B: have job,C: message the boss,D: get ready,E: take bus, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is preparing to leave for work, so "get ready" is the most appropriate choice. "Wake up" is too general and could refer to any time of day, "have job" is not an action someone does before leaving for work, "message the boss" is not a common task before leaving for work, and "take bus" may not apply to everyone, as some people might drive or walk to work. Answer is
--target-- get ready
--input-- Question: Why might someone think killing is justified? Options: A: pleasure,B: punishment,C: pleasure,D: dies,E: investigation, Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason why someone may believe that killing is justified.

--target-- punishment
--input-- Question: James was hunted for stabbing someone to death.  He was afraid that he would be forced to serve what? Options: A: knife wounds,B: law suit,C: llaughing,D: mess,E: jail time, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James committed a serious crime (stabbing someone to death) and will likely face legal consequences as a result. Given the severity of the crime, "jail time" is the most likely outcome. The other options do not provide a logical consequence of committing such a serious offence. Answer is
--target-- jail time
--input-- Question: Where is it especially important to keep a dry, clean floor? Options: A: bed,B: restaurant,C: synagogue,D: wedding,E: all buildings, Knowledge: The sentence implies that having a dry, clean floor is particularly crucial in one specific type of building. Restaurants are places where food is prepared and served, and any spills or wetness on the floor can pose a safety hazard for both employees and customers. In contrast, places like beds, synagogues, and weddings do not necessarily have the same level of risk associated with a wet or dirty floor. The option "all buildings" is too broad and generalizes the sentence's meaning. Answer is
--target-- restaurant
--input-- Question: James loved climbing.  What emotion might he feel from heights? Options: A: exhaustion,B: exhilaration,C: falling down,D: nervousness,E: vertigo, Knowledge: James loves climbing, which suggests he enjoys the physical and mental challenge of ascending a height. The word "exhilaration" means excitement and pleasure, which is a common feeling associated with climbing and experiencing heights. The other options are less likely to be associated with positive emotions related to climbing. Exhaustion and falling down are negative outcomes that James would likely want to avoid, nervousness is a feeling of anxiety, and vertigo is a feeling of dizziness or disorientation. Answer is
--target-- exhilaration
--input-- Question: Where do you get your teeth drill? Options: A: garage,B: army,C: basement,D: dentist office,E: repair shop, Knowledge: The word "drill" is commonly associated with dental procedures such as drilling a cavity or preparing a tooth for a filling or crown.

The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- get money

Options: A: water cooler,B: office,C: alley,D: walmart,E: park, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is using a trash can in the downtown district of a city, which implies that they may be in a densely populated area with buildings and businesses.

The phrase "wanted to have rest" indicates that he wants to take a break and unwind.

The other options are either too specific or don't match the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- relax
--input-- Question: What does a person do if they want to appear authroitative? Options: A: stand erect,B: washing dishes,C: catch cold,D: bow to people,E: wait patiently, Knowledge: The word "authoritative" implies a sense of power or control.

--input-- Question: What happens when I make a pig of myself eating breakfast? Options: A: full stomach,B: gain energy,C: dieting,D: have energy,E: feeling satisfied, Knowledge: The phrase "make a pig of myself" suggests overeating or indulging in an excessive amount of food. Therefore, the most likely outcome would be a full stomach. The other options, such as gaining energy or feeling satisfied, do not align with the context of overindulging. Dieting, on the other hand, is the opposite of overeating and would therefore not be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- full stomach
--input-- Question: What does every human want with someone else? Options: A: healthy relationship,B: wet suit,C: moving car,D: school,E: fight, Knowledge: The question is asking for something that "every human wants with someone else," implying a positive and intimate connection between individuals.

Options: A: night,B: afternoon,C: day time,D: desert,E: early morning, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weather was different from what was expected in the evening, which implies that the temperature changed during the day. The correct option would be the one that indicates a specific time of day when the temperature was not what was anticipated. The other options do not relate to the time of day, and the desert option may even suggest that the evening was still cold. Answer is
--target-- afternoon
--input-- Question: Where can someone enjoy ice cream in the dark? Options: A: party,B: bedroom,C: movie,D: freezer,E: disneyland, Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking about an activity related to darkness.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- movie
--input-- Question: What public house might you expect to hear someone play the harp? Options: A: music shop,B: auditorium,C: ochestra,D: concert hall,E: irish bar, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the harp is commonly played at a specific type of establishment. This is likely to be an Irish bar, as the harp is an important symbol of Irish culture and is often associated with traditional Irish music. Other options, such as a music shop or auditorium, are not specifically linked to the harp and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- irish bar
--input-- Question: I feel like going to a city with lots of fast food chains, where should I visit? Options: A: fast food restaurant,B: seaside,C: germany,D: county,E: united states, Knowledge: The question explicitly mentions fast food chains, which are commonly associated with the United States.

--input-- Question: When he won the dance competition he immediately praised his what? Options: A: moving,B: am happy,C: talent,D: partner,E: sitting still, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the subject is referring to someone they worked closely with during the dance competition. Praise for one's own moving abilities, happiness, or talent would not typically be phrased in this way, and sitting still is clearly not relevant to a dance competition. Therefore, it is most likely that the subject is praising their dance partner for their part in the victory. Answer is
--target-- partner
--input-- Question: If one is eating healthier and exercising what is likely to happen? Options: A: get in shape,B: tiredness,C: sweat,D: diet,E: weight loss, Knowledge: The sentence implies that eating healthier and exercising are likely to have a positive effect on one's physical health. Weight loss is often a desired outcome of these activities as they can help to burn calories and reduce body fat. Tiredness and sweat may be temporary side effects of exercising, but they do not necessarily indicate a positive outcome. Diet is also important for overall health, but it alone may not result in weight loss without exercise. Answer is
--target-- weight loss
--input-- Question: What do you do when you pray, even if you are paralyzed? Options: A: go to church,B: speak to god,C: praise god,D: kneel,E: sincere, Knowledge: The question implies that praying is possible even if someone is paralyzed, which means it does not require physical movement. Speaking to god is a common way of communicating with him during prayer, and this would not be impeded by paralysis. Going to church or kneeling both require physical movement, which would be difficult or impossible for someone who is paralyzed. Praise for god and sincere prayers are important components of prayer, but they do not specifically address the issue of paralysis. Answer is
--target-- speak to god
--input-- Question: What is an object that is not used in a common room likely to be? Options: A: irregular,B: elite,C: rare,D: special,E: personal, Knowledge: The question suggests that the object is not commonly found in a common room, which implies that it may have personal significance or be specific to an individual's taste.

Answer is
--target-- personal

Options: A: skyscraper,B: public building,C: tall building,D: work,E: a house, Knowledge: The sentence specifies that James went into his office at "city hall," which is a public building used for government and administrative purposes. Skyscrapers and tall buildings can also be public buildings, but the sentence does not provide enough information to determine if this is the case. "Work" and "a house" are too general and do not specify the type of building. Answer is
--target-- public building

Options: A: shelf,B: birthday cake,C: church,D: floor,E: dark, Knowledge: The question is asking where you would place a candle if you wanted it on a wall, suggesting that the candle needs to be in a position that is both secure and elevated. A shelf is a logical choice because it can hold the candle securely and is already attached to the wall, making it an easy and safe option. The other options (birthday cake, church, floor, and dark) do not make sense in the context of the question or would not provide a safe or practical location for a candle on a wall. Answer is
--target-- shelf

Options: A: builders,B: architect,C: target,D: tornado,E: tradesmen, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a specific group of people came in to complete the flooring of the building. The term "tradesmen" generally refers to skilled workers who specialize in a particular trade or craft, such as flooring installation.

Options: A: progress,B: collaboration,C: static,D: coup,E: confusion, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the group's ability to communicate well contributed to the quality of their work. Collaboration is a key component of successful teamwork, and effective communication is essential for collaboration to work.

Answer is
--target-- collaboration

Options: A: introducing yourself,B: smiling,C: shake hands,D: share a hug,E: talking, Knowledge: When people meet for the first time in a professional or formal setting, it is common to perform a handshake. This gesture indicates a mutual respect and sets the tone for a positive interaction. The other options may also occur during a meeting, but the sentence specifically mentions "meeting" which suggests a greeting or introduction is taking place, making the handshake the most likely option. Answer is
--target-- shake hands
--input-- Question: Where can you look up a number to a business when you don't have electricity? Options: A: power grid,B: equation,C: telephone book,D: math problem,E: roulette wheel, Knowledge: The question asks where one can look up a number to a business when there is no electricity. This suggests that the answer should not involve electronics or power, ruling out options like power grid and roulette wheel. An equation and math problem are not relevant to looking up phone numbers. A telephone book, however, is a printed directory of phone numbers, making it a reliable source of information when electricity is not available. Therefore, the correct answer is telephone book. Answer is
--target-- telephone book

Options: A: train yourself,B: have strength,C: choke hold,D: strong,E: take lessons, Knowledge: The sentence implies that wrestling requires a certain level of physical strength. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "strong." Options such as "train yourself," "take lessons," and "choke hold" may relate to wrestling to some extent, but they don't clearly describe a trait that is commonly associated with people who wrestle. Similarly, while having strength may go hand in hand with wrestling, it doesn't necessarily imply that someone who wrestles is always very strong. Answer is
--target-- strong
--input-- Question: Billy was smart but inexperienced.  In many ways he was what? Options: A: garish,B: bright,C: ignorant,D: make invisible,E: backward, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while Billy had intelligence, he lacked experience in certain areas. "Ignorant" means lacking knowledge or experience in a particular subject, so it would be the most appropriate choice. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "garish" means overly colorful or flashy, "bright" is a synonym of intelligent rather than inexperienced, "make invisible" is not related to Billy's situation, and "backward" suggests a lack of intelligence rather than a lack of experience. Answer is
--target-- ignorant
--input-- Question: In a barbershop, what is the most important tool the barber uses? Options: A: commercial area,B: razor,C: water,D: city,E: scissors, Knowledge: In a barbershop, a razor is typically the most important tool a barber uses because it is what is used to actually cut the hair. While scissors are also important, they are typically used for more precise cuts and shaping rather than the initial cut. Water may be used to wet the hair or clean the razor, but it is not a tool used for cutting. The other options (commercial area and city) are completely unrelated to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- razor

Options: A: river,B: freshwater lake,C: sunshine,D: music store,E: live in ponds, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the man loved to fish for bass, which are a type of freshwater fish. This suggests that the man would prefer to fish in a freshwater environment. The other options, such as river or live in ponds, may also offer freshwater environments but are not specific to the type of fish the man loves to catch. Additionally, the sentence suggests that the man needs a boat and equipment, which are typically used in larger bodies of water such as lakes. The option of sunshine or music store does not have any clear connection to fishing. Answer is
--target-- freshwater lake

Options: A: mice,B: go home,C: details,D: witty,E: headache, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is describing what makes a good movie and that they appreciate "little" things. This implies that they value attention to detail, which is important in creating a high-quality film. The other options, such as "mice," "go home," "witty," and "headache," do not make sense in the context of describing what makes a good movie. Answer is
--target-- details
--input-- Question: A battleship is a powerful vessel.  If you need something similar but faster, what would you use? Options: A: yatch,B: corvette,C: aircraft carrier,D: destroyer,E: patrol boat, Knowledge: The question is asking for a similarly powerful vessel but faster, which rules out options like patrol boats or yachts which are not designed for speed or strength. An aircraft carrier and a destroyer are both larger and more powerful than a battleship, with different functions and purposes. A corvette, on the other hand, is a smaller, swift military vessel designed for speed, agility, and firepower, making it a suitable option for someone looking for a faster alternative to a battleship. Answer is
--target-- corvette

Options: A: aircraft,B: space shuttle,C: stadium,D: restaurant,E: bathroom, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the toilet was built into a suit used by zero gravity travelers, which implies that the travelers were in space. The context of the sentence implies that this was a particular type of vehicle or mode of transportation, which makes the options of aircraft, stadium, and restaurant less likely choices. The word "toilet" also suggests a limited range of options, and the presence of "shuttle" in the phrase "space shuttle" makes it the most logical choice. Answer is
--target-- space shuttle
--input-- Question: What could cause you to not be sleeping well? Options: A: being at a party,B: relaxation,C: have fun,D: death,E: nightmares, Knowledge: The other options in the list do not specifically indicate a problem with sleeping, whereas nightmares are commonly associated with disrupting sleep patterns. While being at a party or having fun might lead to a lack of sleep in some cases, these options are not specific enough to be the correct answer to this question. Death and relaxation may or may not have an impact on sleep, and would depend on the individual and their circumstances. Answer is
--target-- nightmares

Options: A: coffin,B: denmark,C: bucket,D: basket,E: new hampshire, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the family had a lot of love and affection for their pet dog, so it is likely that they would have given it a proper funeral or burial. The option "coffin" is the most appropriate choice for this, as it is a container used for laying a body to rest. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- coffin

The phrase "died with no regrets" further emphasizes this idea. The last thing that the person did was to take their last breath, indicated by the phrase "as he took his last." The other options - reading a book, going to school, or embarking on a journey - do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the person's contentment or the idea of dying with no regrets. Answer is
--target-- breathe

Options: A: ocean,B: australia,C: asia,D: continent,E: island, Knowledge: The sentence establishes that a continent is a large area of land, but then contrasts this with what the globe is mostly covered by. The most common answer to this would be an ocean, as oceans cover roughly 71% of the Earth's surface. The other options, while all related to geography in some way, do not make sense in this context - for example, Australia is a continent but not the answer we're looking for here. Answer is
--target-- ocean

Options: A: camping in the to and acid is it is not suitable,B: likeable,C: desirable,D: admirable,E: top, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having a home base when camping is important or beneficial.

Options: A: nantucket,B: barn,C: northern hemisphere,D: hen house,E: undergrowth, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the fox ran into a forest and disappeared, suggesting that it was able to conceal itself among the plants and foliage. "Undergrowth" refers to the shrubs and small trees that grow beneath the larger trees in a forest, providing cover for animals like foxes. The other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they are not related to the landscape or the behavior of the fox. Answer is
--target-- undergrowth

Options: A: farming community,B: rural area,C: cow's shed,D: michigan,E: housing farmer and family, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John lives in a remote and isolated location where farming is no longer a prominent activity. This description matches the characteristics of a rural area, which is typically an area that is sparsely populated and dominated by agricultural or natural landscapes. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as they either describe a specific type of building or location or do not meet the criteria of being remote and without farming activity. Answer is
--target-- rural area
--input-- Question: Why do people participate in exercising? Options: A: tiredness,B: exhaustion,C: get sick,D: become stronger,E: use energy, Knowledge: Exercise is commonly associated with building strength and improving overall physical fitness. The other options, such as tiredness, exhaustion, getting sick, or using energy, do not directly relate to the benefits of exercise.

Options: A: work out,B: blood,C: expend energy,D: stretch,E: weigh, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exercising for many months will cause a decrease in something, which is most likely a physical change in the body. The term "weigh" is the only option that specifically refers to a physical measurement of the body, while the other options have more general or nebulous meanings. "Stretch" and "work out" may actually increase rather than decrease with exercise, while "expend energy" and "blood" are not necessarily associated with a change in weight. Answer is
--target-- weigh

Options: A: hat rack,B: school,C: large home,D: palace,E: gateway, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person has saved up enough money to buy something significant. The mention of a dream entrance hall suggests that the purchase is related to a dwelling place and the use of the word "bought" indicates a purchase. "Hat rack" and "school" do not fit the context of purchasing a large home, while "palace" seems too grandiose for the given information. "Gateway" is also unlikely since it does not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- large home

Options: A: drink,B: have fun,C: remember,D: bored,E: good at, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the friends gathered to engage in an enjoyable activity, which is commonly associated with playing cards.

--target-- have fun

Options: A: bargain,B: pay for,C: settle down,D: lose money,E: too far away, Knowledge: The question is asking for a factor that could prevent someone from being able to buy a house. Losing money is a common reason for many people not being able to afford a home. This might be due to a job loss, unexpected expenses or debt payment obligations. Bargaining, paying for, settling down or distance do not seem to imply a lack of affordability for buying a house. Answer is
--target-- lose money
--input-- Question: What will someone do in the house in the evening because of being hungry? Options: A: make bread,B: have lunch,C: eat in restaurant,D: cook dinner,E: school, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is hungry in the evening, which is typically a time when people eat dinner. The phrase "cook dinner" specifically refers to the action of preparing a meal at home, which is a common activity for people who are hungry in the evening. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either refer to meals at different times of day or involve going outside of the house to eat. Answer is
--target-- cook dinner
--input-- Question: What can an injury cause that is messy? Options: A: cause bleeding,B: become infected,C: distress,D: cause death,E: hurts, Knowledge: The word "messy" suggests that the injury can cause some sort of bodily fluid or substance to be present, which would be the case with bleeding. Infections and distress may not necessarily be messy, and while death may result from an injury, the term "messy" does not necessarily describe the outcome. "Hurts" is too general and could apply to any injury, but it does not necessarily imply messiness. Answer is
--target-- cause bleeding
--input-- Question: If you're typing for a long time, what's a sign you should take a break? Options: A: pain,B: carpal tunnel syndrome,C: letter,D: thirst,E: printed word, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that typing for a long time can be physically demanding and potentially harmful. Pain is a common signal from the body indicating that it is under stress or strain, and thus taking a break is necessary. Carpal tunnel syndrome is also a potential health risk associated with typing and can cause pain, but it is a specific medical condition rather than a general sign one should take a break. Letter, thirst, and printed word are not related to the physical stress associated with typing. Answer is
--target-- pain
--input-- Question: Where are trees likely to line a road? Options: A: countryside,B: state park,C: forest,D: garden,E: yard, Knowledge: Trees are often planted along rural roads, especially those located in the countryside, to provide shade and create a pleasing aesthetic. State parks and forests may also have trees lining the roads, but the context of the question implies a more common occurrence, which favors the countryside option. Gardens and yards may have trees, but they are not typically planted along roadsides. Answer is
--target-- countryside
--input-- Question: What is someone having a hard time learning abut science likely to experience? Options: A: smiles,B: frustration,C: accidents,D: become happy,E: experiment, Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone is struggling to learn about science, which suggests that they may feel frustrated. Learning can be a difficult process, and science is a complex subject that requires a lot of effort and dedication to master. Smiling or becoming happy may be unlikely responses to struggling with science, while accidents and experimentation are not related to the emotional experience of learning. Answer is
--target-- frustration
--input-- Question: If you are prescribed an antibiotic by your doctor, where would you go to get it? Options: A: doctor,B: prescribed,C: pharmacy,D: medicine cabinet,E: capsule, Knowledge: When a doctor prescribes medication, it means they are recommending a specific type and dosage of medication for a patient's health condition. Antibiotics are a type of medication that can only be obtained with a prescription. Therefore, the patient would need to take the prescription to a pharmacy where a licensed pharmacist would dispense the medication. The other options do not accurately reflect the proper process of obtaining a prescription antibiotic. Answer is
--target-- pharmacy
--input-- Question: John refused to sleep because of Freddy.   Nothing can hurt you as long as you do what? Options: A: vacuuming,B: being awake,C: wakefulness,D: stay awake,E: entertainment, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is afraid of something that may harm him while he is sleeping, so he chooses to stay awake instead. The phrase "nothing can hurt you" implies that staying awake is seen as a way of protecting oneself from harm. The other options do not reflect the context of the sentence, and are unlikely to be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- stay awake
--input-- Question: Many grains of sand together form what? Options: A: eye,B: bathing suit,C: sand pile,D: clam,E: create pearl, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are many grains of sand being referred to, which when put together, form something. The only option that matches this description is "sand pile." The other options, such as "eye," "bathing suit," "clam," and "create pearl," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- sand pile
--input-- Question: John walked into the courtyard of a famous palace.  Where might he be? Options: A: spain,B: versailles,C: courtroom,D: office complex,E: lawn, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John may be in a palace, which immediately rules out options such as a courtroom or office complex. The mention of a courtyard and a famous palace suggests that the location may be a historical landmark or tourist attraction. Spain, while it does have many famous palaces, is a broad option and therefore less likely to be the correct answer. Finally, the option "lawn" is clearly not the correct answer as it does not fit with the context of the sentence. This leaves "versailles" as the most likely option since it is known as a famous palace with a well-known courtyard. Answer is
--target-- versailles
--input-- Question: Animals do what from birth to death? Options: A: fight each other,B: need to eat,C: drink water,D: live lives,E: feel pain, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the topic is the entire life cycle of animals. The other options are only specific actions that animals may do during their lives, while "live lives" encompasses their entire existence. It is also a basic fact that animals are born and then live until they die, which further supports the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- live lives
--input-- Question: The employee was stocking product, where did he put it? Options: A: display case,B: demonstration,C: market,D: store,E: shelf, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the employee was stocking a product, which typically involves placing it on a designated surface for customers to access. In a store setting, products are often stocked on shelves, making it the most likely option in this context. The other choices, such as display case and demonstration, do not fit the typical method of stocking a product in a retail setting. Market and store are too general and do not provide enough specific information to help make a choice. Answer is
--target-- shelf
--input-- Question: Where can you take your automobile to go as fast as you can? Options: A: garage,B: parkling lot,C: freeway,D: racetrack,E: side of road, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is asking about a place where they can drive their car at high speeds. A racetrack is a common place for car racing or high-performance driving, where drivers can push their cars to their limits in a controlled environment. The other options do not provide a suitable location for high-speed driving. A garage or parking lot are confined spaces, while a freeway and side of the road have speed limits and regulations that prohibit reckless driving. Answer is
--target-- racetrack
--input-- Question: What is a place that has only one ceiling and which could be on ground level? Options: A: house,B: building,C: loft,D: classroom,E: airplane, Knowledge: The question is asking for a place with a single ceiling that can also be located on the ground level. This rules out options such as airplanes, which have multiple levels and are not on the ground, and lofts, which are typically located aboveground. A house or building may have multiple ceilings, so those options can also be eliminated. A classroom, on the other hand, typically has a single ceiling and can be located on the ground level, making it the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- classroom
--input-- Question: What could happen if something surprising happens while you are driving? Options: A: faint,B: accidents,C: frightened,D: laughter,E: funny, Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of a surprising event occurring while driving. One possible consequence is that it could lead to accidents, as unexpected events can cause drivers to lose control of their vehicles or collide with other cars. Fainting, being frightened or laughing do not seem to be appropriate responses to the situation, and "funny" is not a suitable answer in this context, as the question implies a potentially dangerous or serious scenario. Answer is
--target-- accidents
--input-- Question: What is the result of reaching a tentative agreement? Options: A: communicate with,B: settlement,C: shake hands,D: celebration,E: part ways, Knowledge: A tentative agreement usually means that parties involved have come to an understanding, but are not yet fully committed. A settlement, on the other hand, means that the agreement has been finalized and legally binding. The other choices, such as communication or celebration, do not necessarily indicate a finalized agreement. Parting ways also suggests that the negotiation did not reach a successful conclusion. Shaking hands may symbolize agreement, but it does not necessarily mean that a final decision has been reached. Answer is
--target-- settlement
--input-- Question: What else might one feel when hurting? Options: A: death,B: feel sad,C: more hurt,D: punishment,E: accident, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hurting is associated with an emotional response, which is likely to be negative since the choices include "death," "punishment," and "accident." "More hurt" is also a possible response to hurting, but it is not a valid answer to the question because it is a physical response rather than an emotional one. "Feel sad" is the most appropriate answer because it aligns with the emotional connotations of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- feel sad
--input-- Question: If diamonds are not free nor cheap, what are they? Options: A: enslaved,B: free with coupon.,C: expensive,D: paid for,E: imprisoned, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that diamonds have a high value because they are neither free nor cheap. The term "expensive" is commonly associated with objects that have a high monetary value. The other options, such as enslaved or imprisoned, do not make sense in the context of a discussion about the price of diamonds. Answer is
--target-- expensive
--input-- Question: When making a chicken salad, how is the chicken made to be in smaller pieces? Options: A: baked in oven,B: chopped,C: bought at store,D: cooked by grilling,E: eaten, Knowledge: When making chicken salad, the chicken is typically cooked first and then chopped or shredded into smaller pieces before being mixed with the other ingredients. Baking, grilling, or buying pre-cooked chicken at the store would not necessarily result in the chicken being in smaller pieces. "Eaten" is not a method of preparing the chicken. Therefore, "chopped" is the most likely correct answer. Answer is
--target-- chopped
--input-- Question: What do you need to do to keep a surprise party a surprise? Options: A: keep secret,B: laugh,C: enjoy,D: scare,E: send flowers, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to keep a surprise party a surprise, one needs to do something specific. To keep a surprise party a surprise, one must keep the fact that there is a party a secret from the person who is being surprised. The other options are not related to keeping a surprise party a surprise in any way. Answer is
--target-- keep secret
--input-- Question: Fighting inflation means being aware of many things, such as what with loans? Options: A: not noticeable,B: loss of money,C: economic instability,D: rising interest rates,E: problems, Knowledge: Inflation is often accompanied by rising prices, which can lead to an increase in interest rates. This is because the central bank may raise interest rates to control inflation by reducing the amount of money in circulation. A higher interest rate makes borrowing more expensive, which can help to curb spending and reduce inflation. Therefore, being aware of rising interest rates is important when fighting inflation. The other options do not have a clear connection to inflation and loans. Answer is
--target-- rising interest rates

Options: A: temperate zone,B: south america,C: countryside,D: africa,E: earth, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the scientist was searching for a specific type of bird, the endangered toucan, and that he was doing so in a forest.

--target-- injuries
--input-- Question: Where would you get a dog if you do not have one? Options: A: pet store,B: outside,C: neighbor's house,D: park,E: rug, Knowledge: Pet stores are well-known for selling pets, including dogs, so this choice would make the most sense in the context of the question. The other options, such as outside, neighbor's house, park, and rug, do not provide any clear indication of where one would obtain a dog. Answer is
--target-- pet store
--input-- Question: Where could you find passengers that are planning to travel to another continent? Options: A: car,B: bus depot,C: bus stop,D: library,E: airport, Knowledge: Passengers who are planning to travel to another continent are most likely to be found at an airport.

--target-- airport
--input-- Question: Where might a person store an antibiotic to keep it out of the reach of children? Options: A: stomach,B: pharmacy,C: prescribed,D: medicine cabinet,E: capsule, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to keep the antibiotic out of reach of children, implying that it should be stored in a secure location. A medicine cabinet is a common location for storing medications that need to be kept out of reach of children. Storing the antibiotic in the stomach or a capsule does not make sense as these are not storage locations, and being prescribed or coming from a pharmacy does not provide any information about where to store the medication. Answer is
--target-- medicine cabinet
--input-- Question: When you shake a can of spray paint you'll hear a bead do what? Options: A: nod,B: stay still,C: rattle,D: be still,E: stir, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that when a can of spray paint is shaken, there is a sound or movement that occurs.

The other options do not accurately describe the expected result of shaking a can of spray paint. Answer is
--target-- rattle
--input-- Question: The glass bottle ha a symbol on the bottom.  This symbol told customers what about the bottle? Options: A: combustible,B: dirty,C: clear,D: very fragile,E: recyclable, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the symbol on the bottom of the glass bottle is related to its properties or intended use. The options "combustible," "dirty," and "very fragile" do not seem relevant in this context, while "clear" is a characteristic of glass that does not require a symbol to indicate it. Therefore, it is likely that the symbol indicates that the bottle can be recycled, which is a common practice for glass containers. Answer is
--target-- recyclable
--input-- Question: What would you be doing if you are having lunch? Options: A: eating,B: hunger,C: burp,D: laughing,E: food, Knowledge: The question is asking about an action that is typically associated with having lunch. Eating is the most logical choice as it is the main activity that usually takes place during a meal. Hunger is a sensation that someone might experience before or after lunch, but it is not an action. Burping and laughing are unrelated to the act of having lunch, while food is a broad category that could refer to any aspect of a meal. Answer is
--target-- eating
--input-- Question: Where does a plane go when it has reached its destination? Options: A: air,B: eat,C: sky,D: runway,E: fall, Knowledge: When a plane reaches its destination, it must land on a runway. The runway is specifically designed for planes to take off and land safely. The other options do not make sense in the context of a plane reaching its destination. The plane may be in the air during flight, but it must eventually land on the runway. "Eat" and "fall" are not relevant to the question. Answer is
--target-- runway
--input-- Question: Where are you likely to to find a marmot other than the zoo? Options: A: wilderness,B: south america,C: jungle,D: in its den.,E: new zealand, Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions and are known to burrow in the ground or rocks. Therefore, the option "wilderness" seems like the most appropriate choice as it is a vast area of undeveloped land with diverse terrain and vegetation which can provide a suitable habitat for marmots to thrive. The other options such as "jungle" or "new zealand" do not align with the natural habitat of marmots. Answer is
--target-- wilderness
--input-- Question: What would be a cheap way for a medieval family to satisfy their hunger? Options: A: go to the store,B: make bread,C: bring home fish,D: go to market,E: eat hamburger, Knowledge: The question is asking for a cheap way for a medieval family to satisfy their hunger, which suggests that they may not have had access to a lot of money or resources. Making bread is a simple and inexpensive way to feed a family, as it only requires basic ingredients like flour, water, yeast, and salt. Going to the store, going to the market, or bringing home fish may not have been viable options for a medieval family depending on their location, income, and availability of resources. Eating a hamburger is not a plausible option because hamburgers did not exist during medieval times. Answer is
--target-- make bread
--input-- Question: Where do you originally get kleenex from? Options: A: wipe nose,B: blow nose,C: box,D: purse,E: pocket, Knowledge: Kleenex is a brand name of facial tissue typically used for wiping or blowing one's nose.

--target-- box

Options: A: falling down,B: give up,C: exhaustion,D: travelling,E: going somewhere, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill struggles with riding his bike uphill, indicating that it requires a significant amount of physical exertion. The phrase "pushed himself to the point of" implies that Bill's physical activity was so strenuous that it caused him to experience a negative consequence. "Exhaustion" is the only choice that accurately reflects the consequences of over-exertion, while "falling down", "give up", "travelling", and "going somewhere" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- exhaustion
--input-- Question: When you play chess and work hard to improve at it, and finally have it pay off you will feel what? Options: A: smart,B: have fun,C: made,D: satisfaction,E: superior, Knowledge: The question suggests that the feeling one experiences after working hard to improve at chess and succeeding is related to a sense of achievement or fulfillment. The choice "satisfaction" best captures this idea. "Smart" may be a feeling one experiences after successfully solving a challenging problem or learning something new, but it is not necessarily the feeling associated with improving at chess. "Have fun" is not the most fitting choice as it does not reflect the idea of hard work paying off. "Made" is not a feeling, it is a verb. "Superior" is not the most fitting choice as it implies a sense of dominance or superiority over others, which may not be the case in this scenario. Answer is
--target-- satisfaction
--input-- Question: There are usually four strings on what popular instrument? Options: A: trumpet,B: kite,C: quark,D: guitar,E: bird's nest, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the instrument in question is a popular one and usually has four strings.

--target-- guitar
--input-- Question: Your oven is most likely found where? Options: A: restaurant,B: prison,C: school,D: own home,E: pizza place, Knowledge: The options include different types of establishments, but the sentence suggests that the subject is referring to their personal oven.

Answer is
--target-- own home
--input-- Question: What is someone likely to feel after killing someone? Options: A: horrible,B: funeral,C: remorse,D: going to jail,E: scared, Knowledge: Killing someone is a serious act that often elicits strong emotions. While it is possible that someone may feel scared or worried about getting caught and going to jail, the term "remorse" specifically refers to a feeling of deep regret or guilt about a past action, which is more likely to apply to someone who has taken another person's life. The term "horrible" is also associated with negative emotions, but it is not specific enough to the context of the question. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential emotional response to killing someone. Answer is
--target-- remorse

Options: A: punishment,B: anger,C: arrested,D: suffering,E: hatred, Knowledge: The question is asking for the result or consequence of hurting someone else. "Suffering" is a logical choice because it describes the pain or distress that the person who was hurt is likely to experience. The other options do not adequately capture the consequence of causing harm to another person. "Punishment" and "arrested" may be consequences from a legal or social perspective, but they do not necessarily describe the emotional or physical result of being hurt. "Anger" and "hatred" may be emotions that the injured party may feel, but they do not describe the physical or emotional pain that results from being hurt. Answer is
--target-- suffering
--input-- Question: If you're standing in front of people holding index cards what are you likely doing? Options: A: learning,B: oral report,C: office supply store,D: card catalogue,E: library, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is standing in front of people while holding index cards.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- oral report
--input-- Question: A bugle sounded every morning where? Options: A: music store,B: army corps,C: army,D: military band,E: military base, Knowledge: The word "bugle" is often associated with military and is typically used to signal specific events, such as reveille in the morning.

Options: A: video game,B: garage,C: food court,D: carpenter's shop,E: building, Knowledge: The term "level up" is commonly associated with video games, where players progress through different levels of difficulty as they gain experience points.

--input-- Question: Where can birds clean themselves? Options: A: outside,B: nest,C: birdhouse,D: roof,E: water fountain, Knowledge: Birds typically clean themselves by bathing in water, either in natural bodies of water, such as rivers or ponds, or in man-made structures like bird baths or water fountains. The other options do not involve water or a place where birds could bathe. Nest is where they live, outside is too general, birdhouse is where they rest, and roof doesn't involve any water source for bird cleaning. Answer is
--target-- water fountain
--input-- Question: In the video game he used the rocket launcher at long range, but up close he would switch to the rapid fire what? Options: A: pistol,B: assault rifle,C: submachine gun,D: grenade launcher,E: shotgun, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the player in the video game preferred to use the rocket launcher from a distance, indicating that the weapon was best suited for long-range combat. However, when the player was up close, they switched to a weapon with a fast firing rate, suggesting that they needed to take out enemies quickly. The assault rifle, submachine gun, and shotgun all have rapid fire capabilities, but the shotgun is typically used for close-range combat, making it an unlikely choice. The pistol and grenade launcher do not have the rapid firing capabilities suggested in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is submachine gun. Answer is
--target-- submachine gun
--input-- Question: I was creating art while angry, what did my painting convey inadvertently? Options: A: work of art,B: feeling of accomplishment,C: making love,D: pleasure,E: strong emotion, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the painting was created while the person was feeling angry, which is likely to have influenced the resulting artwork. Anger is a strong emotion, and it is likely that the painting conveyed this emotion inadvertently. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence - while creating art can be a work of art, a feeling of accomplishment or pleasure, these options do not connect with the fact that the creator was angry while making it. Making love is also a completely unrelated option that does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- strong emotion
--input-- Question: Who takes forever to pass a bill? Options: A: congress,B: wallet,C: restaurant,D: mail box,E: presidents, Knowledge: The sentence implies that passing a bill is a slow and tedious process, which is commonly associated with the US Congress.

Options: A: opaque,B: opal,C: obscured,D: obscure,E: thick, Knowledge: The context suggests that the paint that Jim considered using would have covered up the natural beauty of the wood. This implies that the paint is not transparent and therefore, opaque would be the best answer. Opal refers to a type of gemstone and does not make sense in this context. Obscured and obscure mean to make unclear or difficult to understand, and thick does not necessarily imply that the paint would cover up the natural beauty of the wood. Answer is
--target-- opaque
--input-- Question: He was washing hands, what happened to his hands as a result? Options: A: jazz hands,B: health,C: become wet,D: skin irritation,E: dry skin, Knowledge: The sentence states that the person was washing their hands, which implies that their hands became wet as a result. The other options do not make sense in the context of washing hands. "Jazz hands" is a type of dance move and has nothing to do with washing hands. "Health" is a broad and vague option that does not provide enough context to make sense as an answer choice. "Skin irritation" and "dry skin" may be possible outcomes of washing hands with harsh soaps or chemicals, but the sentence does not provide any indication that this is what happened. Answer is
--target-- become wet

Options: A: popped,B: loose,C: compressing,D: contract,E: cramped, Knowledge: The sentence describes a muscle, and the word "stretched" implies that it was previously extended or lengthened. In this context, when a muscle "contracts," it means that it is shortening and tightening back up again. This is a normal and healthy response to stretching, as it helps to strengthen the muscle and improve its flexibility. The other options do not fit with what typically happens to a muscle after it has been stretched. Answer is
--target-- contract
--input-- Question: Why would someone fail after giving an answer? Options: A: problem,B: question,C: wrong,D: ask,E: swear, Knowledge: In this context, "fail after giving an answer" suggests that the person's answer was incorrect. "Wrong" is the most logical choice, as it directly relates to giving an incorrect answer. "Problem" and "question" are too general and don't necessarily imply an incorrect answer. "Ask" and "swear" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- wrong
--input-- Question: The drunk man was hitting bottle figuratively and literally when he slammed it down on the what? Options: A: buying beer,B: ticket,C: aim,D: table,E: breaking, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the drunk man was angry or frustrated, and he expressed this emotion by slamming a bottle down on something. The most logical option is the table, as it is a common object that can be found near someone who is drinking. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence; buying beer and getting a ticket are unrelated to the man's behavior, aim is not a tangible object, and breaking is a consequence of the man's action rather than the target of it. Answer is
--target-- table

Options: A: battle,B: doctor,C: mexico,D: workplace,E: in the fridge, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the human wants to be in a warm place, which eliminates options like "in the fridge."

The remaining option that fits the context is "mexico," as it is a country with a warm climate. Answer is
--target-- mexico

Options: A: warm air,B: stay alive,C: calmness,D: living,E: relaxation, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the exercise involved deep and slow breathing, which is a common technique used to promote relaxation and reduce stress.

--target-- relaxation
--input-- Question: What can be used to carry a small dog? Options: A: swimming pool,B: basket,C: dog show,D: backyard,E: own home, Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about something that can be used to carry a small dog, so options like swimming pool, dog show, backyard, and own home do not make logical sense. A basket, however, is often used to transport small animals, and would be a reasonable choice for carrying a small dog. Answer is
--target-- basket
--input-- Question: Where are files likely to be hanging? Options: A: filing cabinet,B: tree,C: suitcase,D: computer,E: desk drawer, Knowledge: The word "hanging" suggests that the files are being stored vertically rather than horizontally. The only option that allows for vertical storage is the filing cabinet. The other options - tree, suitcase, computer, and desk drawer - do not typically involve files being stored in a vertical position. Answer is
--target-- filing cabinet

Options: A: bleeding,B: imprisonment,C: mess,D: killing,E: give up, Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that the man was caught stabbing his wife to death, which implies that he committed the act of killing.

Options: A: ocean's eleven,B: ocean floor,C: downtown area,D: high school,E: container, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the crab is a sea creature and that it uses camouflage tactics to catch prey.

--target-- ocean floor
--input-- Question: If people are at war with one another, what might they do as a consequence? Options: A: destroy each other,B: interact,C: talk to each other,D: run amok,E: desire to win, Knowledge: The phrase "at war with one another" implies a violent conflict, which often leads to actions such as destruction and aggression. "Interact" and "talk to each other" are not likely scenarios in the context of war, as the parties involved are typically not in a position to negotiate or communicate effectively. "Run amok" is a vague term that does not provide enough context to indicate a logical consequence of war. "Desire to win" is a general statement that could apply to many situations, but it does not specifically address the consequences of war. Answer is
--target-- destroy each other
--input-- Question: The local place didn't have the variety the customer was after, so he traveled to see the show room in the big what? Options: A: dancehall,B: car dealership,C: theater,D: city,E: vegas, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the customer was looking for a larger selection or more options than what was available locally, and this implies that the customer was looking for a bigger selection offered in a more populous area. The urban connotation of "city" fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options have limited relevance to the context, as a dancehall and theater refer to specific types of buildings, a car dealership refers to a specific type of business, and Vegas, short for Las Vegas, would not be considered a local place for most people. Answer is
--target-- city
--input-- Question: What might happen to someone if they were found guilty of committing perjury? Options: A: embarrassment,B: mistrial,C: going to jail,D: laywer,E: tension, Knowledge: Perjury is a serious crime that involves lying under oath in a legal setting. If someone is found guilty of committing perjury, they may face legal consequences such as fines, probation, or even imprisonment. Going to jail is a common punishment for this offense. Embarrassment and tension may also be feelings that someone experiences in relation to committing perjury, but they are not legal consequences. Mistrial is also not a direct consequence of perjury, but rather a legal decision to invalidate a trial due to some other issue. A lawyer is not a consequence, but rather someone who may be involved in defending or prosecuting a case involving perjury. Answer is
--target-- going to jail
--input-- Question: The couple had a forgiving attitude with each other thereafter, what did they do? Options: A: great relief,B: feel better,C: respect,D: go up high,E: make up, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the couple had a conflict or disagreement, but were able to move past it with a forgiving attitude.

Answer is
--target-- make up
--input-- Question: He bought a warranty for the fragile objects just it case they what? Options: A: sound well,B: become broken,C: patch up,D: disappear from sight,E: gain speed, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the warranty was purchased as a precautionary measure for fragile objects. Fragile objects are prone to breaking, and the purpose of a warranty is typically to provide coverage in case of damage or defects. Therefore, the correct answer is "become broken." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- become broken
--input-- Question: As you live life you get wiser, it is a part of what? Options: A: growing older,B: death,C: experience things,D: toothsome,E: breathe, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that wisdom is acquired over time, which implies that the person is aging and accumulating life experience. The phrase "as you live life" also supports this idea. The other options, such as toothsome and breathe, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- growing older
--input-- Question: Ballet dancing is a form of artistic what? Options: A: swan lake,B: intercourse,C: expression,D: become tired,E: fatigue, Knowledge: Ballet dancing is a form of artistic expression, where dancers use their bodies to convey emotions, tell stories, and express themselves. Swan Lake is a famous ballet, but it is not a broader category that could be used to describe ballet dancing as a whole. Intercourse and fatigue have no connection to ballet dancing or artistic expression, and "become tired" is not a category that could be used to describe any form of dance. Answer is
--target-- expression
--input-- Question: John heard loud noise coming from below him, which was perfectly normal.   It always happened this time of day.  He really hated living here.  Where did he live? Options: A: upstream,B: roof,C: aloft,D: upstairs,E: upwards, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John heard a loud noise coming from below him, indicating that he is living in a multi-level building. The phrase "perfectly normal" suggests that the noise is a regular occurrence, and it happens at a specific time of the day. The phrase "he really hated living here" implies that John is not happy with his living situation. Based on these clues, the correct answer is "upstairs," as it is the only option that is related to living in a building with multiple levels. The other options do not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- upstairs
--input-- Question: Where can you see people enjoying antique transportation? Options: A: synagogue,B: montana,C: carnival,D: supermarket,E: car show, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are experiencing antique transportation as a form of entertainment.

--target-- car show
--input-- Question: A person takes competing seriously, that person works up a what playing even the simplest of games? Options: A: enemies,B: aggression,C: sweat,D: defeat,E: tiredness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person takes competition seriously and works hard even when playing simple games. This implies that the person puts in physical effort and might sweat due to the exertion. The other options do not necessarily reflect physical exertion or hard work during competition. Answer is
--target-- sweat
--input-- Question: What happens when you play games? Options: A: bored,B: have fun,C: win,D: challenge,E: bored, Knowledge: Playing games is often associated with enjoyment and entertainment, which is typically described as "having fun." While some games can be challenging or competitive, the primary purpose of playing games is usually to engage in an enjoyable activity. The option "bored" is listed twice, making it an unlikely correct answer as it does not offer any new information. "Win" and "challenge" may also be possible outcomes of playing games, but they do not capture the essence of the experience in the same way "having fun" does. Answer is
--target-- have fun
--input-- Question: When people aren't communicating or talking to each other, what happens? Options: A: misunderstandings,B: headaches,C: introductions,D: conversation,E: distraction, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when people are not communicating or talking to each other, something negative happens. The word "misunderstandings" implies a lack of clear communication between individuals, which can lead to confusion and conflict. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the negative effects of a lack of communication. Answer is
--target-- misunderstandings
--input-- Question: Beer is usually expensive when you attend what public event? Options: A: refrigerator,B: drink,C: fridge,D: sporting event,E: bowling alley, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cost of beer is higher at a certain type of public event. Sporting events are known for having high prices on food and beverages due to demand and the captive audience. Refrigerator, drink, and fridge are irrelevant to the context of the sentence, while bowling alley could be a possibility but is not commonly associated with expensive beer prices. Answer is
--target-- sporting event
--input-- Question: When you see new people move in next door you might find it what? Options: A: new friends,B: new experience,C: look around,D: change of surroundings,E: interesting, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that seeing new people move in next door will elicit a certain response. The word "interesting" implies that there is a level of curiosity or intrigue involved. The other options may be possible, but do not capture the sense of curiosity suggested by the sentence. "New friends" assumes a positive outcome that may not always occur, "new experience" is too vague and could refer to any number of things, "look around" is not a response but rather an action that may occur as a result, and "change of surroundings" may not necessarily be interesting. Answer is
--target-- interesting
--input-- Question: Two adults do what before one gives birth to a child? Options: A: loving couple,B: act of sex,C: birth,D: parents,E: consent, Knowledge: Based on common knowledge and biology, it is known that two adults engage in sexual intercourse before the woman gives birth to a child. The other options do not accurately describe the process that leads to childbirth. "Loving couple" and "consent" may be necessary factors for healthy and consensual sexual intercourse, but they do not directly answer the question. "Birth" and "parents" refer to the end result and relationship status, respectively, rather than the action that precedes childbirth. Answer is
--target-- act of sex
--input-- Question: If people are busy, what do they tend to do? Options: A: make lists,B: trade places,C: talk to each other,D: hurry along,E: say "hello" to one another, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when people are busy, they tend to do something in response. "Hurry along" is the most logical choice as it implies a sense of urgency and rapid movement, which is a common response to being busy. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of being busy. Making lists may be a response to being organized, but not necessarily busy. Trading places and talking to each other do not necessarily indicate a response to busyness. Saying "hello" to one another may indicate social interaction, but not necessarily a response to busyness. Answer is
--target-- hurry along
--input-- Question: When a person drinks, becoming inebriated, how are they likely to move? Options: A: jumping,B: drunkenness,C: paralysis,D: staggering,E: fights, Knowledge: The word "inebriated" is commonly used to describe the state of being drunk or intoxicated. People who are drunk often have difficulty maintaining their balance and walking in a straight line, leading to a staggering or swaying movement. Jumping and fighting are not necessarily associated with being drunk, and paralysis would make it impossible for the person to move at all. Answer is
--target-- staggering
--input-- Question: Mary was a high school student student.She hang out in a quiet place where she could study.  Then the bell rang, telling her she needed to go.  Where  did she need to go? Options: A: university,B: classroom,C: dinner,D: library,E: every aspect of life, Knowledge: The sentence states that Mary is a high school student, which indicates that she is most likely attending classes in a school. The sentence also suggests that Mary was studying, which further supports the idea that she was in a classroom or library, both of which are common places for students to study. The other options, such as university, dinner, or every aspect of life, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- classroom
--input-- Question: She had a busy schedule, she had to run errands and pick up the kids the second she did what? Options: A: make time for,B: take money,C: go outdoors,D: leave work,E: field, Knowledge: The sentence states that the woman had a busy schedule and needed to run errands and pick up her kids "the second she did" something. This implies that whatever she did would directly affect her ability to complete her tasks. Choosing "leave work" makes the most sense in this context, as leaving work would give her the time to run her errands and pick up her kids. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- leave work
--input-- Question: He waited far to long before beginning work. What is his immediate state of mind? Options: A: stress,B: excitement,C: eagerness,D: panic,E: working, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person waited too long before starting work, which implies that they are now in a state of urgency, potentially experiencing stress or panic. Excitement and eagerness may be associated with starting work, but the phrase "waited too long" suggests a negative connotation, ruling those answers out. "Working" is a state of action, not a state of mind. Answer is
--target-- panic
--input-- Question: The person wanted to make money, so what did he do? Options: A: mint,B: selling things,C: cross street,D: feel resentful,E: machine part, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was motivated by the desire to make money.

Options: A: captivity,B: costa rica,C: river,D: encyclopedia,E: garden, Knowledge: The phrase "out of its cage" suggests that the lizard is being kept in some kind of enclosure or captivity. The other options, such as Costa Rica or a river, do not relate to the concept of captivity or being in a cage. Encyclopedia and garden may be related to lizards but do not give information about the lizard's status. Answer is
--target-- captivity
--input-- Question: What would be built on a foundation of rock? Options: A: pillars,B: mountains,C: bridge,D: mountain range,E: surface of earth, Knowledge: Bridges are typically built on strong foundations that can support the weight of the structure and withstand the forces of nature. Foundations made of rock are often preferred because they provide stability and durability. Pillars may also be built on rock foundations, but they are typically smaller structures than bridges. Mountains and mountain ranges are natural features that are not built by humans, and the surface of the earth is too broad to be considered a foundation for a specific structure. Answer is
--target-- bridge
--input-- Question: He tried to jump his car, what terminal did he connect to after connecting the positive terminal? Options: A: bad,B: uncertain,C: possimism,D: negative,E: adverse, Knowledge: When jumping a car, the positive terminal of a live battery is connected to the positive terminal of the dead battery, and then the negative terminal of the live battery is connected to a metal ground point on the dead car (such as a bolt or a metal surface). Therefore, after connecting the positive terminal, the next step is to connect the negative terminal. The term "negative" is also commonly used to refer to the negative terminal of a battery, making it a logical choice for the answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- negative
--input-- Question: The drama had quite an affect on the humans, the highs and lows had them all what? Options: A: give up,B: bald,C: very adaptable,D: male or female,E: emotional, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the drama had a strong emotional impact on the humans who experienced it, which can be inferred from the phrase "highs and lows." This indicates that the humans were experiencing a range of emotions, which would make them emotional. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- emotional

Options: A: manhattan apartment,B: wood,C: neighbor's yard,D: tree,E: basket, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a squirrel ran up to its home, which is most likely a tree. Therefore, it is likely that the small dog would be barking up a tree as it may have spotted the squirrel and is trying to catch its attention. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- tree
--input-- Question: The housewife needed dry storage, where should she put her things? Options: A: storage closet,B: building,C: inside,D: warehouse,E: pantry, Knowledge: The word "dry" suggests that the items to be stored may be affected by moisture or humidity. A pantry is typically a cool, dry place designed for storing food items such as canned goods, cereal, and non-perishables. A storage closet may also be dry, but it's not typically associated with food storage. A building or warehouse may not have the right conditions for dry storage, and "inside" is too general and does not provide enough context. Answer is
--target-- pantry
--input-- Question: Where might I find a bowl nestled among other bowls in the kitchen? Options: A: refrigerator,B: kitchen top,C: cupboard,D: dishwasher,E: apartment, Knowledge: A cupboard is a type of storage unit often found in kitchens that typically contains plates, bowls, and other kitchenware. The fact that the bowl is "nestled among other bowls" suggests that it would be found in a storage area with other similar items, such as in a cupboard. The other options do not typically contain or store bowls in the kitchen. Answer is
--target-- cupboard
--input-- Question: When people have a variety of opinions, what can they do with one another? Options: A: divorce,B: believe in god,C: gain weight,D: agree or disagree,E: become angry, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people have differing opinions, which implies that they are in a position to agree or disagree with one another. Divorce, belief in God, and gaining weight do not have any logical connection to this context. Becoming angry is a possible emotional response, but it is not a direct action that people can take with one another. Answer is
--target-- agree or disagree
--input-- Question: The government cracked down on anybody protesting, what did the government dislike? Options: A: buy cats at petstore,B: question authority,C: crowds,D: forget,E: wash dishes, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the government was targeting people who were protesting, which typically involves speaking out against authority or challenging the status quo. This indicates that the government likely disliked people who questioned authority, making "question authority" the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- question authority
--input-- Question: Bill told the audience that good things would happen to them if they gave him all of their money. Where is Bill most likely speaking? Options: A: stadium,B: hockey game,C: baseball game,D: church,E: movie theater, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Bill is most likely speaking in a religious setting, such as a church. The idea of giving money to someone in exchange for good things happening is often associated with religious practices, such as tithing. The other options, such as a stadium, hockey game, baseball game, or movie theater, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- church
--input-- Question: Joe wants to stop being married to Jane.  Jane doesn't want it, but she sadly accepts what? Options: A: pleasure,B: getting divorce,C: heartache,D: heartbreak,E: beatings, Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that Joe wants to end his marriage to Jane, which suggests that they are discussing a divorce. The option "getting divorce" directly addresses this point and is therefore the correct answer. The other options, such as "pleasure" and "beatings," do not make sense in the context of this sentence and can be eliminated as incorrect answers. "Heartache" and "heartbreak" could potentially make sense, but they do not directly address the specific action that Jane is accepting (i.e. a divorce). Answer is
--target-- getting divorce
--input-- Question: When trying to clean clothes, what is something that you need? Options: A: get dirty,B: launder,C: sort,D: bleach,E: use water, Knowledge: Water is an essential element when it comes to cleaning clothes. It is used to rinse out stains and dirt from fabric, especially when combined with detergent. While sorting may be helpful in organization, it is not a necessary step in cleaning clothes. Bleach is a type of cleaning agent that may be used in some cases, but not in all, and getting dirty is the opposite of cleaning. Laundering is the process of cleaning clothes, so it is not a necessary item you need in addition to water. Answer is
--target-- use water
--input-- Question: The screwdriver was surprisingly sharp.  This is because it's tip  was what? Options: A: blunt,B: inaccurate,C: flat,D: above board,E: dim, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the screwdriver was unexpectedly sharp, which may indicate that it was not designed to be sharp. The word "sharp" in this context typically refers to a point or edge that can pierce or cut through objects. In contrast, the word "flat" means lacking in sharpness, which could explain why the screwdriver's surprisingly sharp tip was unexpected. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- flat
--input-- Question: Where could I eat a chocolate cake? Options: A: mouth,B: restaurant,C: supermarket,D: school,E: box, Knowledge: The word "eat" implies that the chocolate cake is a food item meant for consumption. While it may be possible to eat a chocolate cake at home from a box, the other options (mouth, school, and supermarket) are not feasible locations to eat a chocolate cake. A restaurant is a likely choice because it is a place where food is served and eaten. Therefore, the correct answer is "restaurant." Answer is
--target-- restaurant
--input-- Question: What might the result of unwanted flirting be? Options: A: attraction,B: problems,C: the gallows,D: being slapped,E: curiosity, Knowledge: The phrase "unwanted flirting" suggests that the flirting is not welcome or appreciated by the recipient. In this context, the result of such behavior would likely be negative, such as causing problems or leading to a physical altercation like being slapped. The other options do not fit with the negative connotations of the phrase "unwanted flirting." Answer is
--target-- being slapped
--input-- Question: When they got a divorce, they stopped talking to each other, so what did they have? Options: A: richer,B: depression,C: meloncoly,D: bad feelings,E: emotional distress, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the divorce between the two individuals resulted in negative emotions or a strained relationship, as evidenced by their lack of communication. While some of the other options may be a result of a divorce, the context of the sentence suggests that the answer is related to the emotional effects of their separation. Answer is
--target-- bad feelings
--input-- Question: Where would you put a drink if you do not plan to use it soon? Options: A: cabinet,B: camelback,C: cup,D: backpack,E: can, Knowledge: A cabinet is a piece of furniture used for storage, typically in a kitchen or dining area. It would be a logical place to put a drink if you do not plan to use it soon, as it could be kept out of the way and protected from spills or other accidents. The other options do not make as much sense in this context. A camelback is a type of hydration pack worn on the back, a cup and can are both used to drink from, and a backpack is for carrying items, not storing drinks. Answer is
--target-- cabinet
--input-- Question: James didn't understand what was going on, but he knew that he had to choose.   He decided that he wasn't going to accept temptation, and did what to it? Options: A: predetermination,B: undecided,C: force,D: concluded,E: reject, Knowledge: The sentence states that James decided not to accept temptation, which implies that he actively chose to resist it. The word "reject" is the only option that accurately reflects this action, while the other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Predetermination" refers to something being decided beforehand, "undecided" means not having made a choice yet, "force" implies using physical or emotional pressure, and "concluded" means coming to a decision after consideration. Answer is
--target-- reject
--input-- Question: A monkey is out in the wild, where are they likely to be? Options: A: tropical areas,B: school,C: research laboratory,D: pet store,E: story book, Knowledge: Monkeys are typically found in tropical areas, such as rainforests, where they live in the trees and forage for food. They are not typically found in school, research laboratories, or pet stores, as they are wild animals and not domesticated. While monkeys may appear in storybooks, this is not a reliable indicator of their real-life habitats. Answer is
--target-- tropical areas
--input-- Question: If a mechanic attaches a chain to your bumper what is he likely driving? Options: A: obesity,B: bicycle,C: motorbike,D: jewelry store,E: tow truck, Knowledge: Attaching a chain to a car bumper is a common practice for tow trucks, which are used to transport vehicles that are unable to move on their own.

--target-- tow truck
--input-- Question: Why might someone avoid getting a new car? Options: A: move quickly,B: go fast,C: cost money,D: crash,E: slow down, Knowledge: The question is asking for a reason why someone might avoid getting a new car. One of the most common reasons for avoiding a new car is the expense.

--target-- cost money
--input-- Question: You should probably have something healthier than just eat ice cream if you what? Options: A: were hungry,B: depressed,C: cool down,D: exercise,E: let melt in mouth, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that eating only ice cream is not a healthy choice when one is hungry. This implies that there are healthier food options available when one is hungry. The other options like being depressed, cooling down or letting the ice cream melt in the mouth do not have any clear relation to the context of the sentence. The option of exercising may be a healthy choice but it is not suggested as an alternative in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- were hungry
--input-- Question: What will an unprepared person experience when taking final exams? Options: A: graduation,B: anxiety,C: happy,D: graduating,E: headaches, Knowledge: The use of the word "unprepared" suggests that the person taking the final exams is not ready for the test. This could lead to feelings of stress, nervousness, and anxiety. Graduation and graduating are not relevant because they suggest a task that has already been completed (not something that is about to be undertaken). Happy is not relevant because the sentence is discussing a negative emotion, and headaches may be a side effect of stress but are not the main focus of this sentence. Answer is
--target-- anxiety
--input-- Question: The champagne was good, it was both sweet and what? Options: A: bitter,B: decaying,C: spicy,D: sour,E: dry, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the champagne had a sweet taste as well as another quality that is complementary to sweetness. The opposite of sweet is often considered to be sour, bitter, or spicy, which do not fit with the context of the sentence. Decaying is not a taste, and therefore cannot be the correct answer. Dryness is often used to describe the taste of champagne and is a common characteristic of high-quality sparkling wines. Therefore, dry is the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- dry
--input-- Question: When picking up drinks, what kind requires you to hold them by the neck? Options: A: glass,B: shoulder,C: body,D: guillotine,E: bottle, Knowledge: Bottles typically have a narrower neck and wider body, making it necessary to hold them by the neck to ensure a firm grip. Holding a glass by the neck doesn't make much sense, as glasses are typically wider at the base, and holding them by the neck would result in an unstable grip. "Shoulder" and "body" are not descriptors of a type of drink, and "guillotine" is not related to drinks at all, so the correct answer is "bottle". Answer is
--target-- bottle
--input-- Question: Where would be a good place for a weasel to hide? Options: A: children's story,B: animated film,C: henhouse,D: mulberry bush,E: bank, Knowledge: The mulberry bush is a common place referenced in the classic nursery rhyme "Pop Goes the Weasel," suggesting that it would be a good place for a weasel to hide.

--target-- mulberry bush
--input-- Question: What does every person have that not every wolf has? Options: A: human intelligence,B: hide,C: name,D: mouth,E: heart, Knowledge: The question is asking for something that every person has that not every wolf has. The answer is likely to be a trait or characteristic that distinguishes humans from wolves. Out of the choices given, only "name" fits this criteria as wolves do not typically have names, while humans are commonly given names. The other choices, such as "human intelligence," "hide," "mouth," and "heart" may be traits that both humans and wolves have in common. Answer is
--target-- name
--input-- Question: He needed a computer program to do a certain task and he knew how to make it, so he began to do what? Options: A: get frustrated,B: write code,C: debug,D: damage,E: compile, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needed a computer program to complete a task, and he had the knowledge of how to make it. Therefore, he would logically start to write code in order to create the program. Debugging comes after writing code and refers to the process of finding and fixing errors in the code. Getting frustrated or damaging the computer are unlikely actions one would take in this situation. Compiling is the process of turning code into a program, but it is done after writing and debugging the code. Answer is
--target-- write code
--input-- Question: When people meet other people in a convivial setting, what tends to happen? Options: A: expect miracles,B: think of life,C: talk to each other,D: form friendships,E: arguments, Knowledge: The word "convivial" suggests a friendly and sociable atmosphere, which is conducive to forming new connections and relationships. When people are in a convivial setting, they tend to be open and receptive to meeting new people, which can lead to the formation of friendships. The other choices (expect miracles, think of life, talk to each other, arguments) do not necessarily pertain to the context of the sentence, and do not align with the expectation of a convivial setting. Answer is
--target-- form friendships

The word "interests" is the most appropriate choice to describe this, as it refers to the things that someone enjoys doing in their free time. The other options do not accurately convey the meaning of the sentence. Answer is

Options: A: side with opponent,B: football,C: hockey game,D: part two boxers,E: sporting event, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the referee is skilled in refereeing various games and has been offered a job that he is unsure of. The fact that the job offer doesn't specify a particular game suggests that it could be a position in a general sporting event. The options related to specific games such as football, hockey or boxing are not supported by the given information. The choice "side with opponent" is contradictory to a referee's role and doesn't make sense in the context. Answer is
--target-- sporting event

Options: A: soccer game,B: street,C: toy store,D: child's hand,E: on the sidewalk, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a small ball is being bounced by someone or something, and one of the options refers to a "child's hand," which is a common place for a child to hold and bounce a small ball. The other options do not seem to have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a soccer game involves a larger ball, the street and sidewalk may refer to bouncing a ball, but not specifically a small one, and a toy store is not a likely place for a ball to be bounced. Answer is
--target-- child's hand
--input-- Question: Where would you use a computer while gaining knowledge? Options: A: apartment,B: house,C: table,D: house,E: school, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the location where one gains knowledge is relevant to the answer. The options "apartment", "house", and "table" do not indicate a specific context for learning. However, "school" is a common location where people use computers to gain knowledge through research, studying, and online classes. Therefore, the correct answer is likely "school". Answer is
--target-- school
--input-- Question: Where do young boys hide dirty magazines? Options: A: library,B: drawer,C: dentist,D: bed,E: airport, Knowledge: The question is asking about a common hiding place for young boys to keep dirty magazines, which implies that the material is likely inappropriate or taboo. The bed is a common hiding place for personal items, such as magazines, because it provides privacy and can be easily accessed. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- bed
--input-- Question: Where would someone bring you a cup? Options: A: apartment,B: closet,C: restaurant,D: table,E: party, Knowledge: A cup is a common item that is typically used to serve a beverage, such as coffee or tea.

--input-- Question: Where do you hang notes in the kitchen? Options: A: fridge,B: sheet music,C: medical chart,D: from a hook,E: desk, Knowledge: The question asks specifically about hanging notes in the kitchen, which suggests that the notes are likely related to grocery lists, reminders, or messages for family members.

Answer is

--input-- Question: A flea made the dog itch, this is because to feed it can do what? Options: A: suck blood,B: bite,C: jump,D: lay eggs,E: attack, Knowledge: Fleas are known for feeding on the blood of their hosts, which is likely the cause of the dog itching. The other options do not accurately describe the behavior of fleas. Biting and attacking may be related to flea behavior in some way, but sucking blood is the most accurate answer based on the information given in the sentence. Jumping and laying eggs are also behaviors associated with fleas, but they are not directly related to why the dog is itching. Answer is
--target-- suck blood

Options: A: small,B: in a hole,C: large city,D: university,E: town, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the buildings were designed to accommodate a large number of people, which is characteristic of urban areas where population density is high. Large cities are typically designed to have a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial areas, in order to support the needs of a large population. University and town are not likely to have the same level of infrastructure or population as a city, while in a hole and small are not feasible options for the construction of such buildings. Answer is
--target-- large city
--input-- Question: What do you need the most to be living life? Options: A: breathe,B: learning,C: sorrow,D: wear a mullet,E: marriage, Knowledge: Breathing is a necessary function for all living beings, and it is essential for sustaining life. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Learning and marriage may enhance one's life, but they are not essential for survival. Sorrow is a negative emotion and cannot be considered a requirement for living life. Wear a mullet is a nonsensical option and has no relevance to the question. Answer is
--target-- breathe
--input-- Question: There were all sorts of shapes in the textbook, the geometry teacher explained how to find the area of the surface for each what? Options: A: turtle,B: tetrahedron,C: object,D: lake,E: geometry problem, Knowledge: The use of the word "shapes" in the sentence suggests that the geometry teacher is discussing various geometric figures.

The other choices are more specific and may not be relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- object

Options: A: hungry,B: choking,C: get full,D: lose weight,E: getting fat, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you eat a very big hamburger, you will experience a certain outcome.

--target-- get full
--input-- Question: I know the answer, but I do not do what to it? Options: A: ignorant,B: correct,C: ignorance,D: had learnt,E: understand, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker knows the answer to a question or problem, but they do not know what to do with it. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect this feeling of uncertainty or confusion. Among the given choices, "understand" is the most appropriate answer because it implies that the speaker has grasped the meaning or solution to the problem, but needs more information or guidance on how to act on it. The other options are either irrelevant or inconsistent with the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- understand

Options: A: car crash,B: splinter,C: automobile accidents,D: smoke,E: backache, Knowledge: The question asks what physical condition a driver could have that would make them not want to drive their car. A backache is a common physical ailment that can make it uncomfortable or painful to sit for prolonged periods of time, such as when driving a car. The other options, such as car crashes, splinters, automobile accidents, and smoke, are not related to a physical condition that would specifically affect a driver's ability or desire to drive. Answer is
--target-- backache
--input-- Question: If you see a policeman in the street waving flashlights what are they there to do? Options: A: jump,B: arrest criminals,C: book robber,D: direct traffic,E: wave on, Knowledge: The use of a flashlight by a policeman in the street typically indicates that they are trying to direct traffic. This is often done during busy periods, accidents or when there is a breakdown in the usual traffic flow. The other options such as jumping, arresting criminals, or booking robbers do not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- direct traffic
--input-- Question: He wasn't able to enjoy the party because he was too worried about his things and cleaning up, where was the party? Options: A: home,B: fraternity house,C: boat,D: friend's house,E: blowing off steam, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the protagonist was worried about his possessions and cleaning up, which indicates that the party took place in their own residence. Home is the only option that could reasonably explain why someone would be concerned about cleaning up and keeping an eye on their belongings during a party. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- home
--input-- Question: where do you buy the freshest apples? Options: A: shop,B: fridge,C: farmers market,D: a tree,E: grocery store, Knowledge: A farmers market is a location where farmers and other vendors sell fresh produce directly to consumers. It is likely that the freshest apples would be found at a farmers market because they are sold directly from the farm to the consumer without any storage or transportation in between. The other options, such as a grocery store or fridge, may not have as fresh of produce as they may have been stored or transported for longer periods of time. Answer is
--target-- farmers market
--input-- Question: What is often an outward expression of happiness? Options: A: love,B: laughter,C: spread,D: tears,E: limp, Knowledge: The word "outward" suggests that the answer is related to something that can be seen or heard. "Happiness" is also a clue that the answer is related to a positive emotion. Laughter is a common expression of joy and happiness, and is often easily recognizable and audible. "Love" and "tears" could also be outward expressions of happiness, but they are not as commonly associated with happiness as laughter. "Spread" and "limp" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- laughter
--input-- Question: What can a manufacturer experience when people are constantly buying products? Options: A: economic boom,B: loss of money,C: agony,D: being able to use,E: spending money, Knowledge: When people are constantly buying products, it means that there is a high demand for the manufacturer's goods, which can lead to an economic boom. This is because the company is making more sales and generating more revenue, which can result in increased profits and growth for the business. The other options do not accurately reflect the positive impact that a high demand can have on a manufacturing company. Answer is
--target-- economic boom
--input-- Question: A big fountain was the center piece of the renovation, it had all been paid for by a grant to the what? Options: A: city,B: state,C: front of casino,D: rome,E: public place, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a grant was used to fund the renovation, but it does not mention any specific organization or entity. However, the fact that a fountain was the centerpiece of the renovation and it was located in a public place implies that it was likely funded by a local government or municipality, such as a city government. The other options, such as a state, a casino, or Rome, are less likely to be the correct answer as they do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- city
--input-- Question: Why would someone be likely to avoid kissing? Options: A: arousal,B: shortness of breath,C: herpes,D: strong feelings,E: confusion, Knowledge: Herpes is a sexually transmitted infection that can be spread through kissing, which is why someone may avoid it if they are worried about getting infected or if they have an active outbreak of herpes. Arousal and strong feelings may actually make someone more likely to want to kiss, while confusion is not likely to be a factor in this context. Shortness of breath could potentially be a reason someone avoids kissing, but it is not as directly related to the spread of herpes as the infection itself. Answer is
--target-- herpes
--input-- Question: What can judging something wrong lead to? Options: A: eat cake,B: responsibility,C: resentment,D: controversy,E: go to jail, Knowledge: The question asks about the potential consequences of judging something wrong, and controversy is a logical answer as it suggests that disagreements and debates may arise from differing opinions on what is right or wrong. Eating cake and going to jail are not relevant responses to the question, and while responsibility and resentment may be potential consequences of judging something wrong, they do not capture the full range of possible outcomes as effectively as controversy. Answer is
--target-- controversy
--input-- Question: Why do people want to read fiction books? Options: A: having fun,B: falling asleep,C: learn new things,D: learn unknown concepts,E: memorize, Knowledge: While people may want to read fiction books for a variety of reasons, such as to learn new things or concepts, the most commonly cited reason is to have fun. Fiction books often provide an escape from reality and allow readers to immerse themselves in imaginative worlds and characters, providing entertainment and enjoyment. While some people may read to fall asleep or to memorize information, these are not typically the primary reasons why people choose to read fiction. Answer is
--target-- having fun
--input-- Question: What would you do to numbers that are positive integers to get a result that is orders of magnitude larger? Options: A: written down,B: divided,C: added up,D: multiplied,E: get headache, Knowledge: When you multiply a positive integer by another positive integer, the resulting number will be orders of magnitude larger than the original number. This is because each additional digit increases the magnitude of the number by a factor of 10. The other options do not involve any mathematical operations that would increase the magnitude of a number, and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- multiplied
--input-- Question: She couldn't hide she liked the boy she was talking to, she had a constant what? Options: A: make eye contact,B: smile,C: another person,D: listening,E: compliment, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the girl's feelings towards the boy were evident in her behavior. One common way that people physically show interest or attraction towards someone is by smiling, which is likely why the sentence states that she had a constant smile. The other options (make eye contact, listening, compliment, another person) do not necessarily indicate interest or attraction towards the boy, and therefore are not the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- smile
--input-- Question: The cut was deep, the doctor had to use stitches in doing what the sides? Options: A: joining,B: put together,C: paste,D: heal,E: paste, Knowledge: The word "stitches" suggests that the doctor was sewing something together, which would be the sides of the cut in this case. "Joining" and "putting together" both have a similar meaning to sewing or stitching. "Paste" could refer to a topical treatment, but it does not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Heal" is the ultimate result of the doctor's actions, but it does not describe what the doctor actually did. Answer is
--target-- joining
--input-- Question: Every person would get along in a what? Options: A: eat well,B: live comfortably,C: perfect world,D: fruit bowl,E: own house, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in a perfect world, every person would get along.

--target-- perfect world
--input-- Question: What is a common cause of injury? Options: A: accident,B: theatre,C: doctor's office,D: hockey game,E: living thing, Knowledge: The word "injury" suggests that the question is asking about a harm that comes to a person's body. The word "common" implies that the cause is something that occurs frequently. Accidents are a common cause of injury because they can happen in many different situations, such as car crashes, falls, and sports injuries. The other options do not have the same association with injuries. Answer is
--target-- accident
--input-- Question: If you keep telling many people about being a vegetarian what do you risk becoming? Options: A: annoyance,B: accomplish,C: intoxicated,D: emotional distress,E: notoriety, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if someone keeps talking to multiple people about their vegetarianism, there might be negative consequences. "Annoyance" is the most fitting choice since the continuous talking about vegetarianism can become tedious and irritating to others. The other options do not seem to relate to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- annoyance
--input-- Question: James imported ugly cabinets because they were cheap.  They wouldn't be seen so it didn't matter what they looked like.  Where might they be installed? Options: A: kitchen,B: planes,C: mexico,D: bathroom,E: pantry, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cabinets were imported because they were cheap, and that they wouldn't be seen, which implies that they were meant for a storage space rather than a visible area like a kitchen or bathroom. A pantry is a place where people store food and other household items, and it is not a high-traffic area of the house, so it makes sense that someone might choose to install cheaper and less attractive cabinets there. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, either because they are visible areas (kitchen and bathroom) or because they do not make sense in the context (planes and Mexico). Answer is
--target-- pantry
--input-- Question: The comedian made a dull joke about a bald eagle and it ending up that way because of what treatment? Options: A: new york,B: canada,C: chemotherapy,D: rocky mountains,E: british columbia, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the joke made by the comedian was related to bald eagles and a specific treatment that may have caused them to become bald. Chemotherapy is a medical treatment commonly associated with hair loss, which may explain why it was mentioned in the same sentence as the joke about bald eagles. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- chemotherapy
--input-- Question: Where would you put your car keys if you want to go driving? Options: A: ignition switch,B: pocket,C: purse,D: home,E: trunk, Knowledge: The ignition switch is where the car key is inserted to start the engine and begin driving. The other options, such as pocket, purse, and home, are not relevant to the context of the question and would not be where one would typically place car keys when preparing to drive. The trunk is also an incorrect option as keys are not typically stored in the trunk of a car for driving purposes. Answer is
--target-- ignition switch
--input-- Question: It is a lovely day, let's go outside and skate instead of doing what? Options: A: really,B: put on helmet,C: sing,D: not work so hard,E: falling down, Knowledge: The sentence implies that going outside to skate is a better alternative to doing something else. The other answer choices, such as putting on a helmet or singing, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Falling down" is also not a logical alternative to doing something else, but a potential consequence of skating. Therefore, the correct answer must be "not work so hard," as it is the only opposing option that suggests a different activity that is more enjoyable than working. Answer is
--target-- not work so hard
--input-- Question: He worked hard to have great success at his chosen what? Options: A: new job,B: vocation,C: awards ceremony,D: schedule,E: michigan, Knowledge: The use of the phrase "chosen what" indicates that the correct answer will be a career or profession that someone actively pursues or chooses for themselves. The use of the word "success" suggests that this career or profession may involve achieving certain goals, milestones, or accomplishments. Out of the given choices, only "vocation" fits this criteria, as it refers to a person's life/career calling or purpose. The other choices are either too specific (new job, awards ceremony) or unrelated (schedule, Michigan) to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- vocation
--input-- Question: The cover was a hindrance to the diners, so what did they do with it? Options: A: underneath,B: opening,C: divert suspicion,D: leave open,E: landcover, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the cover was causing some sort of problem or inconvenience for the diners, so they decided to do something about it. The most logical option would be to leave it open or remove it entirely. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "underneath" and "opening" are not actions that can be taken with a cover, "divert suspicion" is irrelevant and doesn't make sense, and "landcover" is not a common term associated with covers in this context. Answer is
--target-- leave open
--input-- Question: In any city you usually see a high rise where? Options: A: residential area,B: san francisco,C: downtown,D: suburbs,E: detroit, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the high rise is located in a central and busy part of a city. The option "downtown" is the most likely answer, as it refers to the commercial and business hub of a city where high-rise buildings are commonly found. The other options are either too specific (e.g., San Francisco, Detroit) or not relevant to the context of a high-rise building. Answer is
--target-- downtown
--input-- Question: If a lot of cargo trucks come and go every day, where would the forklift get the most use? Options: A: loading dock,B: construction site,C: construction yard,D: warehouse,E: cargo, Knowledge: The context suggests that the forklift would be used in a place where cargo trucks come and go frequently, which is usually at the loading dock of a warehouse or a distribution center. A loading dock is a designated area where goods are loaded and unloaded from trucks, so it is where the forklift would be most useful. The other options such as construction sites or yards may also use forklifts, but they are not as likely to have a high volume of cargo trucks coming and going. Answer is
--target-- loading dock
--input-- Question: The route passenger was flipping through a magazine, he was bored waiting for his ride where? Options: A: shop,B: work,C: rack,D: bus depot,E: newsstand, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the passenger is waiting for a ride, which points to the bus depot as the correct answer. A bus depot is a place where buses stop to let passengers on and off, and it is common for people to wait there for their transportation. The other options (shop, work, rack, and newsstand) do not typically involve waiting for a ride, and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- bus depot
--input-- Question: What is often the result of having lunch too fast? Options: A: spending money,B: sickness,C: heartburn,D: low blood sugar,E: obesity, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence associated with eating lunch too quickly. Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can be caused by eating too quickly and not chewing food properly. Sickness, low blood sugar, and obesity are not necessarily associated with eating too quickly, and spending money would not be a direct consequence of eating too quickly. Answer is
--target-- heartburn
--input-- Question: If the weather means you what, so do your animals? Options: A: travel,B: get cold,C: feel pain,D: move,E: electrical circuit, Knowledge: The phrase "If the weather means you..." implies that the weather has a certain effect on the subject being discussed, and the answer choice "get cold" makes logical sense in this context. Animals are often affected by changes in temperature, and if the weather is cold, it makes sense that the animals would also get cold. The other options are not necessarily related to weather or animals. Answer is
--target-- get cold
--input-- Question: WHere does someone sit in a chair to gossip? Options: A: desk,B: friend's house,C: auditorium,D: synagogue,E: ocean, Knowledge: The word "gossip" implies a casual and social setting where people are talking about personal matters. Sitting at a desk or in an auditorium does not fit this context. A synagogue is a religious place and not necessarily a place for gossip. The ocean is unrelated to the context of the question. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a friend's house, which is a common place for casual conversations and gossip. Answer is
--target-- friend's house
--input-- Question: She filled the thing with water and went to plug it in, she had finally finished her garden with what centerpiece? Options: A: stream,B: perfume,C: sink,D: fountain,E: swamp, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker filled something with water and plugged it in, which indicates that it is an electronic device. The use of the word "centerpiece" suggests that it is a decorative object that holds a prominent place in the garden. A fountain fits these criteria as it is a water feature that is often used as a decorative centerpiece in gardens. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not commonly associated with gardens or decorative centerpieces. Answer is
--target-- fountain
--input-- Question: Where would you find a single air conditioner? Options: A: house,B: in a bike,C: car,D: hard,E: texas, Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer must be a location or object where a single air conditioner could be found. Therefore, options such as "house", "hard", and "Texas" are not specific enough to provide a clear answer. Additionally, the option "in a bike" is unlikely since bicycles generally do not have air conditioning units. Therefore, the best option is a car, as it is a common location for a single air conditioner unit in order to keep the passengers cool while driving. Answer is
--target-- car
--input-- Question: If you're hearing sounds what product the uses a laser are you using? Options: A: physics lab,B: laboratory,C: bomb,D: hospital,E: cd players, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the product mentioned uses a laser to produce sound. CD players use lasers to read the data stored on a disc and convert it into audio. Physics labs may use lasers for experiments, but this is not specific to sound production. Laboratories, bombs, and hospitals do not typically use lasers for sound production. Answer is
--target-- cd players
--input-- Question: The music was very dear to him, he had done what with it during an important time in his life? Options: A: night club,B: dreamt,C: composed,D: written on paper,E: stolen, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the music was very dear to the person, which suggests that they were involved in its creation. The phrase "during an important time in his life" implies that the person had a significant personal connection to the music, which further supports the idea that they were the composer. The options of night club and stolen do not fit with the context of the sentence and dreamt and written on paper do not provide enough information to support a correct answer. Answer is
--target-- composed
--input-- Question: Dancing or walking too much will lead to what on your feet? Options: A: humiliation,B: fatigue,C: skin,D: blisters,E: exhaustion, Knowledge: The question suggests that the activity of dancing or walking can cause a physical problem on the feet. Fatigue and exhaustion are related to muscle tiredness and overall exhaustion, while humiliation is related to social embarrassment rather than a physical symptom. Skin is too broad of a term, and not specific enough to indicate a foot problem. Blisters, however, are a common problem that can occur on the feet from too much friction or pressure, making them the most likely correct answer. Answer is
--target-- blisters
--input-- Question: If you know how to read and write you are what? Options: A: smart,B: literate,C: have paper,D: not give up,E: creativity, Knowledge: Literacy refers to the ability to read and write, which is the context of the sentence. While being literate may be associated with intelligence or having access to education (which could be connected with being smart or having paper), the most direct connection to the sentence is that literacy is the ability to read and write. The other options may not be incorrect, but they are not the most precise match for the question. Answer is
--target-- literate
--input-- Question: What would you experience if a friend robs you after cashing in chips at a casino? Options: A: betrayal,B: resentment,C: depressed,D: leave,E: profit, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a friend has taken advantage of you by stealing after cashing in chips at a casino. This would likely lead to feelings of betrayal, as you had trusted your friend but they violated that trust. Resentment and depression are also possible emotional responses, but betrayal is the most likely fit based on the context. "Leave" and "profit" are not relevant options, as they do not reflect the negative impact of being robbed by a friend. Answer is
--target-- betrayal
--input-- Question: People took their seats and read their programs. They were expecting to enjoy an entertaining night of what? Options: A: group functions,B: church,C: theater,D: conference,E: television, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people took their seats and read their programs, which is commonly associated with a theater performance. It also mentions that they were expecting to enjoy an entertaining night, which is another clue that points to theater as the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- theater
--input-- Question: You shouldn't consume toothpaste, despite that it goes in your what?? Options: A: bathroom,B: sink,C: traveling case,D: suitcase,E: mouth, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while toothpaste is commonly found in the bathroom and may be stored in a traveling case or suitcase, it is not meant to be consumed. The context of the sentence implies that the word being sought refers to a part of the body, and the only option that fits that description is "mouth." Answer is
--target-- mouth
--input-- Question: The weasel would go round and round the what while waiting to attack? Options: A: apple tree,B: rabbit warren,C: chicken coop,D: mulberry bush,E: viking ship, Knowledge: The phrase "go round and round" suggests that the weasel is moving in circles around something. In this case, the weasel is waiting to attack, so it is likely circling its prey. Out of the options given, only the mulberry bush is commonly associated with the children's rhyme "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush," which includes the phrase "the monkey chased the weasel." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- mulberry bush
--input-- Question: What do airplanes do as they are beginning to take off? Options: A: speed up,B: carry people,C: stop,D: slow down,E: crash, Knowledge: Airplanes need to gain speed in order to take off, which is why they typically accelerate down the runway during this phase of flight.

--target-- speed up
--input-- Question: Billy was a solider.  He joined the military because he wanted to do what? Options: A: to marry,B: fight for freedom,C: report for duty,D: wait for orders,E: receive orders, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Billy joined the military for a specific reason. The phrase "fight for freedom" is commonly associated with military service, as soldiers often go to war to protect their country's freedoms and liberties. The other options do not make sense in this context. For example, getting married is not typically a reason to join the military, and waiting for orders is something that soldiers do after they have already joined. Answer is
--target-- fight for freedom
--input-- Question: What might cause someone to have a last passing sentence? Options: A: bounding,B: death,C: grief,D: judgement,E: appeals, Knowledge: The phrase "last passing sentence" suggests an end to someone's life. The word "passing" is often used as a euphemism for death, while "last" implies that this sentence is final, indicating that the person has died. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to death or the end of life. "Bounding" could refer to jumping or moving quickly, while "grief" is a feeling of intense sadness, "judgment" refers to decision-making or legal processes, and "appeals" are requests for a decision to be reviewed. Answer is

--input-- Question: The mountain was very massive.  It did what to the nearby hills? Options: A: lame,B: insubstantial,C: inconsequential,D: dwarf,E: massless, Knowledge: The word "massive" implies that the mountain is very large and imposing in size, which suggests that it would make the nearby hills seem small by comparison. The word "dwarf" means to make seem small or insignificant, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options are all antonyms of massive and do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- dwarf
--input-- Question: Where can you find a single musician that an audience is listening to? Options: A: studio,B: stage,C: band,D: symphony,E: orchestra, Knowledge: The word "audience" suggests that the musician is performing in front of a group of people, and the phrase "single musician" suggests that they are performing alone rather than as part of a larger group. The most likely place for this to happen is on a stage, where a performer can stand alone and be the focus of attention for the audience. The other options, such as a studio or orchestra, may involve multiple musicians working together or may not involve a live audience. Answer is
--target-- stage
--input-- Question: What do you miss out on if you stay in and read book all day? Options: A: learning,B: education,C: experience,D: knowledge,E: learn to read, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if someone stays in and reads a book all day, they are missing out on something. Since reading a book is a solitary activity, it's likely that the thing they are missing out on is some sort of social or interactive experience. The other options such as learning, education, knowledge, or learning to read are not necessarily mutually exclusive with reading books and therefore don't explain what someone would miss out on if they specifically stay in and read all day. Answer is
--target-- experience
--input-- Question: Where might someone find an abundance of cloth? Options: A: egyptian tombs,B: fabric store,C: kitchen,D: washing machine,E: bedroom, Knowledge: A fabric store is a place that commonly sells cloth. This is in contrast to the other options, which do not typically have cloth readily available. Egyptian tombs may have preserved clothing made of cloth, but it would not be readily available for purchase or use. The kitchen and bedroom may have items made of cloth, but they are not places where cloth is typically stored or sold. The washing machine is used to clean clothes made of cloth, but it is not a place where cloth is found in abundance. Answer is
--target-- fabric store
--input-- Question: The man finished mowing his lawn and enjoyed a glass of lemonade on his porch, he took a sip and told himself that life was what? Options: A: good,B: ending soon,C: fleeting,D: finite,E: important, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man had finished a chore (mowing his lawn) and was therefore taking a break to enjoy a refreshing beverage on his porch. The fact that he tells himself something after taking a sip of lemonade indicates that he is taking a moment to reflect on his life. The word "good" is a positive descriptor that conveys a sense of contentment and satisfaction with his life at that moment. The other options ("ending soon," "fleeting," "finite," "important") do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest a more negative or uncertain outlook on life. Answer is
--target-- good
--input-- Question: The trim made a good line between the floor and the what? Options: A: obesity,B: desk,C: sky,D: wall,E: ceiling, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trim is separating two surfaces and the options that could be separated by a line would be a wall and a floor. The other options, such as obesity or sky, do not correlate with the context of the sentence. Similarly, a desk does not necessarily require a trim to divide it from the floor, and the ceiling is usually separated from the floor by a wall rather than a trim. Answer is
--target-- wall
--input-- Question: Where would you fire a projectile ball at a clown's mouth? Options: A: flintlock,B: tennis court,C: at home,D: motion,E: arcade, Knowledge: The question implies that firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth is a game that can be played. This game is typically found in arcades as a carnival or circus themed attraction. The other options do not provide any context related to the game's setting, so they are unlikely to be correct answers. Answer is
--target-- arcade
--input-- Question: The guy was going to bed instead of going to work, what does he suffer from? Options: A: money,B: making love,C: laziness,D: dreaming of,E: falling asleep, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the guy is choosing to go to bed instead of going to work, indicating a lack of motivation or productivity. This could be explained by laziness, as the other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Money" and "making love" do not seem relevant, while "dreaming of" and "falling asleep" suggest unconscious actions rather than a conscious decision to skip work. Answer is
--target-- laziness
--input-- Question: What low area between mountains can an apple tree be typically found? Options: A: valley,B: washington state,C: open,D: countryside,E: fields, Knowledge: Apple trees are commonly associated with growing in valley regions, where the climate is cool and mild with moderate rainfall. This environment provides ample growing conditions for apple trees, which require well-drained soil and good air circulation. The other options, such as Washington State or open fields, do not necessarily indicate a specific area where apple trees are commonly found. Answer is
--target-- valley
--input-- Question: Playing piano and other creative activities need what? Options: A: make music,B: inspiration,C: musical sounds,D: making music,E: dancing, Knowledge: The sentence is talking about creative activities, specifically playing the piano. Inspiration is often a key component in any artistic endeavor, and playing the piano is no exception. While making music and creating musical sounds are important aspects of playing the piano, the sentence is asking for a broader term that encompasses all creative activities. Dancing is not related to playing the piano at all, and "make music" and "making music" are essentially the same answer with different phrasing. Answer is
--target-- inspiration
--input-- Question: What happens after committing murder? Options: A: distress,B: kill,C: problems,D: go to jail,E: fear, Knowledge: Committing murder is a serious crime that typically results in the perpetrator being sentenced to jail time. While the other options may be associated with murder in some way, such as feeling distress or fear before or after the act, or experiencing problems as a result of their actions, going to jail is the most direct and likely consequence of committing murder. Answer is
--target-- go to jail
--input-- Question: What is the path of the earth around the sun called? Options: A: fotograph,B: orbit,C: tree,D: solar system,E: attraction, Knowledge: The question is asking for the specific term used to describe the path of the earth around the sun. "Orbit" is the correct answer because it refers specifically to the elliptical path that a celestial body takes around a larger body, such as the earth's path around the sun. "Fotograph," "tree," "solar system," and "attraction" are not related to the earth's motion around the sun, and therefore are not the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- orbit
--input-- Question: Where would you put a vase on your wall? Options: A: cabinet,B: windowsill,C: table,D: fall off shelf,E: shelf, Knowledge: The question asks about where to put a vase on the wall, which suggests that the vase needs to be elevated and supported. A cabinet or table would not be on the wall, and a windowsill may not be sturdy enough to hold a vase. "Fall off shelf" is not a suitable option. "Shelf" is the most appropriate choice as it provides a surface to hold the vase and is mounted on the wall. Answer is
--target-- shelf
--input-- Question: What are humans doing when they have offspring? Options: A: regret,B: drive cars,C: hear sounds,D: make mistakes,E: reproduce, Knowledge: Reproduction is the biological process by which organisms create descendants. Humans, like most other animals, reproduce sexually, meaning they produce offspring through the union of male and female reproductive cells. The other choices (regret, drive cars, hear sounds, make mistakes) do not relate to the biological process of reproduction. Answer is
--target-- reproduce
--input-- Question: The robber wanted to conceal his pistol, where did he put it? Options: A: police station,B: war,C: police officer's belt,D: river,E: pants, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the robber wanted to hide his pistol, which is something that could easily be done by placing it in a location that is not visible to others. The option "police station" is unlikely because it's a place where guns are kept secure, whereas the robber wants to keep his gun hidden. "War" is also an unlikely option as it doesn't have any clear connection to the sentence. "Police officer's belt" might be a possible answer, but the sentence doesn't provide any context to suggest that the robber was near a police officer or had access to their belt. "River" is also unlikely as it would be an inconvenient and ineffective place to hide a gun. Answer is
--target-- pants
--input-- Question: Where in a house would a table be most likely placed? Options: A: living room,B: kitchen,C: dining room,D: conference,E: demonstration, Knowledge: A table is commonly used for dining and therefore would most likely be placed in a dining room. While a table could be found in other areas such as a living room or kitchen, those spaces are not primarily used for dining purposes. The options "conference" and "demonstration" are not typically associated with a household setting and are unlikely choices. Answer is
--target-- dining room
--input-- Question: The person was always using mouthwash, why were they doing that? Options: A: headache,B: to quench thirst,C: white teeth,D: source of income,E: fair trial, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was using mouthwash regularly for a specific reason. One common reason for using mouthwash is to promote dental hygiene and achieve white teeth. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- white teeth
--input-- Question: What type of person wants to get in shape? Options: A: look attractive,B: overweight,C: sex,D: bowel movements,E: feel good, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the desire to get in shape is motivated by a need to address a physical condition - being overweight. While there may be other reasons why someone wants to get in shape, such as wanting to look attractive or feel good, the statement specifically references a physical condition. The other options - sex and bowel movements - are unrelated to the topic of getting in shape. Answer is
--target-- overweight
--input-- Question: What vehicle uses a tow chain? Options: A: motorbike,B: jewelry store,C: tow truck,D: trailer,E: gear shift, Knowledge: The use of a tow chain implies that the vehicle is capable of towing something behind it, which rules out options like motorbike and jewelry store. The term "trailer" also suggests a vehicle that is designed for towing, but it is not explicitly stated that a tow chain is used with a trailer. Gear shift does not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Therefore, tow truck is the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- tow truck
--input-- Question: What's black and white and contains many a story? Options: A: past,B: book or magazine,C: novel,D: newspaper,E: story book, Knowledge: The phrase "contains many a story" suggests that the answer is a publication that regularly features multiple stories. While books, magazines, and novels can contain multiple stories, they are typically not black and white. Story books may be black and white, but they are not typically associated with containing multiple stories on a regular basis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is newspaper, which is traditionally black and white and contains a variety of news stories. Answer is
--target-- newspaper
--input-- Question: Several other people were standing around James.  They were jumping up and down, screaming loudly, and banging their heads.  Where might James have been? Options: A: water,B: in class,C: meeting,D: mall,E: concert, Knowledge: The actions described in the sentence (jumping up and down, screaming loudly, banging their heads) suggest a high-energy and exciting environment, which is commonly associated with concerts. The other options do not fit this context - "water" is too vague, "in class" and "meeting" are unlikely to involve such behavior, and the "mall" is an unusual place for people to act this way. Answer is
--target-- concert
--input-- Question: Where does water enter in a dam to create electricity? Options: A: wet clothes,B: power turbine,C: cracks,D: thin soup,E: dribble, Knowledge: Dams are typically built across rivers or other bodies of water to create a large reservoir that can be used to generate electricity. Water enters the dam through an intake valve or gate and flows into a penstock, which is a large pipe that carries the water to the power turbine. The force of the water in the penstock turns the blades of the turbine, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity. Wet clothes, cracks, thin soup, and dribble are not related to the process of generating electricity in a dam. Answer is
--target-- power turbine
--input-- Question: During battle he felt great anger, this drove him to do what? Options: A: drive car,B: destroy enemy,C: punch,D: release energy,E: write letter, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question was involved in a battle and felt a strong emotion that influenced their actions. Anger is commonly associated with aggression and a desire to harm others, which may explain why the person was driven to destroy their enemy. The other options do not make sense in the context of a battle where anger is present. Answer is
--target-- destroy enemy
--input-- Question: What is one likely trying to find an answer for when something is broken? Options: A: question,B: wrong,C: problem,D: swear,E: confusion, Knowledge: When something is broken, it is typically not working as it should, indicating that there is a problem. Therefore, someone who is trying to find an answer for a situation where something is broken is likely looking for a way to fix the problem. The other options do not necessarily have a clear connection to the context of something being broken. Answer is
--target-- problem
--input-- Question: Billy liked seeing new teachers at school.   He enjoyed meeting new people, but didn't care about the quality of his what? Options: A: excitement,B: university of chicago,C: fear,D: envy,E: education, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy likes seeing new teachers because he enjoys meeting new people. However, it also implies that Billy doesn't care about the quality of his education, as this is not mentioned in the sentence. The other options, such as excitement or envy, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The option "University of Chicago" is not relevant to the sentence, since it is not mentioned whether Billy attends or aspires to attend this institution. Answer is
--target-- education
--input-- Question: What can you do to a door but not to a jar? Options: A: found at shower,B: opened,C: found up store,D: closed,E: locked, Knowledge: This question is asking for a verb that can only be applied to a door and not to a jar. The answer is "locked" because you can lock a door using a key, padlock, or other devices, but you can't lock a jar as it typically does not have a locking mechanism. The other options, such as "closed" or "opened," are applicable to both doors and jars. Answer is
--target-- locked
--input-- Question: Billy was a student taking a course in communications.  Where might he be taking his classes? Options: A: every aspect of life,B: library,C: in a movie hall,D: classroom,E: university, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Billy is a student taking a course, which implies that he is enrolled in an educational institution. The other options (every aspect of life, library, in a movie hall, classroom) do not necessarily suggest an academic setting. The option "university" is the most likely answer as it is a common place for students to take courses in communications. Answer is
--target-- university
--input-- Question: Driving to work had become a chore for her and she felt what at the slightest hint of traffic? Options: A: promotion,B: pressure,C: busy,D: getting there,E: impatience, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is frustrated with driving to work, specifically with traffic. The use of the word "chore" implies that it is something she does not enjoy, and the mention of traffic hints at a potential cause of her frustration. The word "impatience" fits into this context as it is a common feeling associated with waiting in traffic. The other options do not make sense in this context or are not closely related to the situation described in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- impatience
--input-- Question: He feels like just a cog in a machine or just a number in a cubicle when he is working where? Options: A: planner,B: math book,C: office,D: mathematics,E: phonebook,  Answer is

Options: A: tired feet,B: pondering,C: gaining knowledge,D: exhilaration,E: wonder, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny spent all day at the museum looking at exhibits, indicating that he was on his feet for an extended period. Additionally, the sentence mentions that he studied the exhibits carefully, indicating that he was likely moving around and engaging with the exhibits. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that he might have gone home due to tiredness in his feet from standing and walking all day. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- tired feet
--input-- Question: Lance spotted a wet beaver in the river.  Where might have lance been? Options: A: dictionary,B: books,C: australia,D: seaside,E: countryside, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Lance was likely in a natural setting, since he spotted a beaver in a river.

The options "garden floor," "rocks," "bushes," and "garden" do not provide any clear sources of information, while "books" is a commonly used source for research and learning. Additionally, books may contain detailed descriptions of different types of lizards, including their habitat, behavior, and physical characteristics. Answer is
--target-- books
--input-- Question: Where would a doctor rush to? Options: A: nursing home,B: sick patients,C: dentist,D: emergency room,E: golf course, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a doctor would "rush" somewhere, which implies that there is an urgent need for medical attention. The only choice that reflects an urgent medical situation is the emergency room. A nursing home typically has patients who require long-term care, and while a dentist may be necessary for some urgent dental situations, it is not likely that a doctor would rush to a dental office. The same applies to sick patients in general. The golf course is not related to any medical event. Answer is
--target-- emergency room
--input-- Question: What traditional shop would one find a razor in? Options: A: medicine cabinet,B: barber shop,C: bath room,D: grocery store,E: suitcase, Knowledge: Razors are commonly used for shaving, which is a service provided by barbers in traditional barber shops.

Options: A: solar system,B: night sky,C: hollywood,D: constellation,E: red carpet, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is using one specific star to help them locate other objects in the sky. This is a characteristic commonly associated with constellations, which are groups of stars that are named and recognized based on their patterns in the sky. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- constellation
--input-- Question: The man was sick of not attracting women and began to practice grooming, what was his goal? Options: A: tardiness,B: neatness,C: bathe,D: late,E: looking good, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was trying to improve his appearance in order to attract women. The goal of grooming is often to enhance one's appearance by being neat, clean, and well-dressed. The options "tardiness" and "late" have no relevance to the context, while "bathe" is a basic hygiene practice and doesn't necessarily imply an effort to look more attractive. "Neatness" is a possibility, but "looking good" is a more direct and accurate answer given the context of attracting women. Answer is
--target-- looking good
--input-- Question: The clerk had a paper sign, where did he put it? Options: A: hallway,B: public place,C: toilet,D: shop window,E: store window, Knowledge: The use of the word "clerk" implies that the sign was posted in a commercial setting, rather than a hallway or toilet. Additionally, the fact that the sign was made of paper suggests that it was not intended to be a permanent fixture, so it is likely that the clerk put it in a location with high visibility to draw attention to a sale or promotion. The options "public place" and "hallway" are too general to suggest a specific location, while "toilet" is unlikely for a promotional sign. Therefore, "store window" is the most logical choice. Answer is
--target-- store window
--input-- Question: On the hot day, they liked to eat  ice cream, what was their goal? Options: A: were hungry,B: cool down,C: get full,D: depressed,E: let melt in mouth, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the characters in the sentence were looking for relief from the heat, which is commonly associated with the goal of cooling down. Eating ice cream is a common way to cool down on a hot day, as the cold temperature of the treat can help to lower body temperature. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- cool down
--input-- Question: What institution are you trying to dissolve if you're getting a divorce? Options: A: court,B: marriage,C: being married,D: two people,E: lawyer, Knowledge: Divorce is the legal process of ending a marriage, so the institution being dissolved in a divorce is the marriage itself. The other choices either do not accurately describe the situation or are not directly related to the legal process of divorce. Answer is
--target-- marriage
--input-- Question: If I'm at the doctor's office looking for a good title, what sort of story am I looking to read? Options: A: book,B: magazine article,C: safe deposit box,D: hotel menu book,E: library, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is looking for something to read while waiting at the doctor's office. The most likely option from the choices provided would be a magazine article, as these are often found in waiting rooms and cover a variety of topics that can be read quickly. The other options do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence, as a safe deposit box, hotel menu book, and library are not things that one typically finds in a doctor's office, and the word "book" is too general and could refer to anything. Answer is
--target-- magazine article
--input-- Question: When you are eating a meal you normally place a cup on this. Options: A: dishwasher,B: table,C: shelf,D: coaster,E: closet, Knowledge: The sentence describes a common practice when eating a meal, which is to place a cup on a surface. The most likely surface for this action is a table, which is used for dining and typically has enough space to accommodate a cup. The other options do not make sense in this context - a dishwasher is used for cleaning dishes, a shelf is usually elevated and not a good surface for placing cups, a coaster is specifically designed for cups but may not always be available, and a closet is not a surface for placing cups at all. Answer is
--target-- table
--input-- Question: Why is someone likely to use an iron when cleaning clothes? Options: A: wrinkles,B: sanitation,C: attractive appearance,D: looks good,E: ruined, Knowledge: Ironing clothes is a common practice to remove wrinkles and creases that may have formed during washing, drying, or storage. The heat and pressure from the iron help to smooth out the fabric and give it a crisp appearance. Sanitation is not a primary reason for using an iron, although ironing can help to kill bacteria and freshen up clothes. "Attractive appearance" and "looks good" are essentially the same as removing wrinkles. "Ruined" is the opposite of the intended result. Answer is
--target-- wrinkles

Options: A: england,B: tea,C: cupboard,D: water,E: japanese tea room, Knowledge: A teakettle is commonly used for boiling water, which is an essential step in preparing tea.

--target-- water
--input-- Question: What does someone do when there are dishes astray in the kitchen? Options: A: gain weight,B: wait patiently,C: stand erect,D: promise to do,E: washing dishes, Knowledge: The word "astray" suggests that the dishes are not in their proper place or are dirty, which would require someone to clean them.

--target-- washing dishes
--input-- Question: The dream was so terrible, what did the dreamer do? Options: A: reality,B: nightmare,C: park,D: dreamworker,E: awake, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dream was unpleasant or frightening, which would make the dreamer want to wake up and escape from the dream. The other options do not fit the context, as they do not relate to the dream being terrible or the dreamer wanting to escape from it. Answer is
--target-- awake
--input-- Question: The library wanted to get the community more involved, so they began to screen family what? Options: A: monitor,B: homes,C: drive in movie,D: theatre,E: movies, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the library was seeking to increase community engagement, and one way they did this was by screening a particular type of film. The options "monitor" and "homes" do not make sense in this context, while "drive in movie" and "theatre" are more specific locations for screening movies. "Movies" is the most general option and fits best with the sentence. Answer is
--target-- movies

Options: A: backpack,B: table,C: jar,D: box,E: container, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the food needs to be carried along on a long walk, and the most common way to do so would be in a backpack or a similar bag. The other options, such as a table or a jar, do not make sense in this context as they are not practical for carrying food on a long walk in the countryside. A box or a container may work, but a backpack is generally the most convenient and popular choice. Answer is
--target-- backpack

Options: A: clothing store,B: shopping plaza,C: shopping mall,D: laundromat,E: thrift store, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was looking for a specific item in a larger shopping area, which is commonly found in shopping malls. Clothing stores, thrift stores, and laundromats are not typically found in a shopping mall and would not require hours of browsing. A shopping plaza could be a possibility, but the term "shopping mall" is more commonly used to describe a large indoor shopping area with multiple stores. Answer is
--target-- shopping mall
--input-- Question: Where do you keep perishable food for a longer time? Options: A: table,B: trash can,C: store,D: freezer,E: home, Knowledge: Perishable food needs to be kept at a low temperature to extend its shelf life.

--input-- Question: Where would you keep a canoe? Options: A: boat house,B: mountain stream,C: water,D: garage,E: campground, Knowledge: A canoe is a type of boat that is typically used for recreational activities on bodies of water such as lakes and rivers. Therefore, it is logical to store a canoe in a place that is specifically designed for boats, such as a boat house. The other options, such as a mountain stream or campground, may be places where a canoe could be used, but they are not necessarily places where one would store a canoe. A garage may be an alternative option, but it is less common than a boat house for storing boats. Answer is
--target-- boat house

--target-- joy
--input-- Question: Where should shoes not be? Options: A: walking,B: closet,C: suitcase,D: table,E: bed, Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where shoes should not be placed.

The options of table and bed are both flat surfaces where shoes could easily be placed, but it is generally considered inappropriate to put shoes on either of these surfaces. Therefore, the correct answer is table. Answer is
--target-- table
--input-- Question: He found it odd that while attending lecture the professor got preachy, and even weirder when his fellow students started to what? Options: A: applaud,B: laughed,C: learning,D: taking notes,E: fall asleep, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the professor began to preach during the lecture and the other students reacted in a way that the speaker found odd. Applauding is a possible reaction to a speaker who is perceived as inspiring or motivating, so it makes sense that the students started to applaud. Laughing or taking notes would not necessarily be an unusual response, and falling asleep would not be a reaction to a professor becoming preachy. Learning is also not considered an unusual reaction to attending a lecture. Answer is
--target-- applaud
--input-- Question: Why would you be doing housework? Options: A: cleanliness,B: allergies,C: joy,D: exhaustion,E: boredom, Knowledge: Housework is typically done to maintain a clean and organized living space. Allergies may also be a reason to clean, but it wouldn't necessarily be the main focus of the question. Joy or exhaustion may not be the primary motivation for doing housework, and boredom isn't necessarily a reason to clean, as there are many other things one could do to alleviate boredom. Answer is
--target-- cleanliness
--input-- Question: Where is a catwalk unlikely to be? Options: A: theater,B: airplane,C: theatre,D: new york city,E: fieldhouse, Knowledge: A catwalk typically refers to a narrow elevated platform used for walking, which is commonly found in theaters or on airplanes for crew members. New York City is a possible location for a catwalk, but it is not specific enough to determine its likelihood. A fieldhouse, on the other hand, is more likely to be an indoor sports facility with a large open space, making it an unlikely location for a catwalk. Therefore, the correct answer is fieldhouse. Answer is
--target-- fieldhouse

--target-- cupboard

Options: A: problems,B: sorrow,C: embarrassment,D: happy,E: panic, Knowledge: The sentence implies that falling in front of people while going to a public store may cause a person to feel a certain way. The word "felt" is in the past tense, suggesting that the person has already experienced this.

However, being threatened can certainly cause fear or anxiety, which is the closest option to the question being asked. Answer is
--target-- fear

Options: A: exit ramp,B: repair shop,C: driveway,D: front yard,E: garage, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man left his car outside when he got home from work. The options "exit ramp" and "repair shop" do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they relate to locations outside of the man's home. "Front yard" is a possibility, but "driveway" is a more specific and likely answer since it is a common area to leave a car parked outside of one's home. "Garage" could also be a possibility but the sentence implies that the car was not put away in the garage. Answer is
--target-- driveway
--input-- Question: Where might a student store a pencil when traveling Options: A: backpack,B: desktop,C: classroom,D: desk drawer,E: pocket, Knowledge: The question is about where a student might store a pencil while traveling, which suggests that the answer should be a portable, convenient option. A backpack is a common choice for students to carry their school supplies in, especially when traveling or on the go. The other options, such as desktop or desk drawer, are stationary and not suitable for traveling. Pocket may be an option, but it depends on the size of the pencil and the type of clothing being worn, which adds uncertainty to the answer. Answer is

Options: A: car seats,B: department stores,C: stable,D: merry go round,E: handbag, Knowledge: Leather horseback riding equipment, such as saddles, bridles, and boots, are typically found at stables or equestrian supply stores. They are used specifically in the context of horseback riding, so options like car seats or handbags do not make sense.

--target-- stable

Options: A: enjoy film,B: make bread,C: go to the gym,D: stay in bed,E: write, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill likes to do creative things on rainy days and that he loves to taste things. Making bread is a creative activity that involves tasting and experimenting with different flavors and ingredients.

Options: A: newspaper,B: books and magazines,C: own home,D: public library,E: good homes, Knowledge: Literature refers to written works that have artistic or intellectual value, including books, poems, plays, and essays. Newspapers may contain written works, but they are considered more of a source of news and information rather than literature. "Own home" and "good homes" do not make sense as options as they are not related to literature. A public library may contain literature, but it is not necessarily a type of literature itself. "Books and magazines" is the best answer as it directly refers to written works that are a part of literature. Answer is
--target-- books and magazines
--input-- Question: The place felt wrong, but higher up had said this was the right what? Options: A: job,B: map,C: location,D: line,E: almost anywhere, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is some discrepancy between how the place feels and what someone higher up has said.

Options: A: coma,B: falling down,C: pain,D: death,E: forgetfulness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is experiencing unexpected episodes of unconsciousness, which is a common symptom of a concussion. Additionally, the sentence states that he is also suffering from something else. The word "annoying" implies that whatever he is experiencing is more of an inconvenience than a serious medical issue. The option "coma" and "death" are both extreme and do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Falling down" and "pain" could be related to a concussion, but they do not fit with the idea of him losing consciousness at annoying times. "Forgetfulness" is a common symptom of a concussion and fits well with the context of the sentence. Answer is

"Compute" is a verb that describes what a computer does, but it does not describe the situation of a computer not working. "Networked" describes a type of computer connection, but it does not describe the situation of a computer not working. Answer is

Options: A: waste bin,B: cellar,C: attic,D: fridge,E: museum, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker needs to store old items in a place where they will not get damp, which suggests a dry and elevated location. A common place for this type of storage is an attic, which is typically a dry and insulated space located above the main living areas of a house. The other options are unlikely choices for storing old items, as a waste bin would not be suitable for preserving items or protecting them from dampness, a cellar may be too damp, a fridge is too small and not used for storage of non-food items, and a museum would not be accessible for personal use. Answer is
--target-- attic

Options: A: happiness,B: embarrassment,C: fatigue,D: fulfillment,E: enjoyment, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman's behavior was not socially acceptable, as she was yelling obscenities in public. Therefore, her husband is likely to feel embarrassed by her actions, as they reflect on both her and him as a couple. The word "entertaining" implies that others found the situation amusing, but it does not provide any information about the husband's feelings. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is

It is designed for people to read, study and research, therefore it is likely that someone could find a huge amount of text in a library.

Mistake implies that the act was unintentional, which may not be the case in this context. Murder is a synonym for killing, but it carries additional legal and moral connotations that may not apply universally. Answer is

"Analyse," "die," and "read book" are all too specific or unrelated, while "see favorite show" may imply a desire to escape one's current location, but does not necessarily suggest a sense of curiosity or exploration. Answer is
--target-- go somewhere
--input-- Question: Why do people want to have fun? Options: A: have sex,B: enjoy yourself,C: waste time,D: laughter,E: spontaneous, Knowledge: The choices all relate to the concept of having fun, but only "enjoy yourself" captures the general positive feeling associated with having fun. "Have sex" is a specific type of activity that some people may enjoy for fun, but it does not encompass the full range of activities that people do for fun. "Waste time" has a negative connotation and suggests that fun is a frivolous or unproductive use of time, which is not necessarily true. "Laughter" and "spontaneous" are also related to having fun, but they are more specific and do not capture the broad motivation for why people want to have fun. Answer is
--target-- enjoy yourself

Options: A: graduation,B: headaches,C: fail again,D: success,E: failure, Knowledge: In academic settings, a 4.0 GPA is generally considered a perfect score, indicating that the student has achieved the highest level of success in their courses. Therefore, it can be inferred that the person was feeling successful after receiving their grades. The other options are not congruent with the context of the sentence, as graduation is not mentioned and headaches or failing again would likely not be associated with a perfect GPA. Answer is
--target-- success
--input-- Question: What item has parts such as rods and pistons? Options: A: sporting goods store,B: engine,C: cool,D: eyeball,E: fishing camp, Knowledge: Rods and pistons are parts commonly found in engines, which are mechanical devices that convert fuel into motion.

Options: A: dry skin,B: nudity,C: cleanliness,D: use soap,E: having a strong scent, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan's mother emphasized the importance of bathing, which would be primarily for hygiene purposes. The option "cleanliness" directly relates to hygiene and therefore would be the correct answer. The other options either do not directly or indirectly relate to the context of the sentence or are erroneous (such as "nudity" being an outcome of bathing). Answer is
--target-- cleanliness
--input-- Question: The cow was a star.  Everyone knew it from the what? Options: A: wisconsin,B: fairy tale,C: nebraska,D: advertisement,E: countryside, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cow was famous or well-known, which could be due to being featured in an advertisement.

Options: A: make wine,B: cross street,C: wear jeans,D: take bus,E: take taxi, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally and another person were waiting in the rain, which implies that they were waiting for some form of transportation.

Answer is
--target-- take bus
--input-- Question: Where might customers go to walk around? Options: A: mall,B: park,C: market,D: found in restaurant,E: bookstore, Knowledge: The word "customers" implies that the context is related to a commercial or business setting.

--input-- Question: A great singers voice is going to be? Options: A: loud,B: beautiful,C: sound,D: george michael,E: commmunicating, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a great singer's voice is going to possess certain qualities. While volume may be important for some styles of singing, the use of the word "beautiful" implies that this is the primary characteristic being referred to here. Beauty in a vocalist's voice is subjective, but is generally related to tone, timbre, and resonance. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- beautiful
--input-- Question: What can you do in your house during the winter? Options: A: ski,B: skate,C: play hockey,D: blaze it,E: knit, Knowledge: The question is asking about indoor activities that can be done during the winter, which suggests that the correct answer should involve something that can be done inside the house. Skiing, skating, and playing hockey are outdoor winter sports that require specific equipment and spaces, so they are unlikely to be done inside the house. "Blaze it" is a non sequitur and has no relation to the question. Knitting, on the other hand, is a common indoor hobby, and it is a popular winter activity for many people. Answer is
--target-- knit

Options: A: town,B: park,C: bus station,D: train station,E: taxi stand, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the extrovert enjoys interacting with strangers while taking public transportation to school. This implies that the extrovert is likely to take a bus instead of other modes of transportation such as a train or a taxi. The park and town do not have any connection to public transportation, and are therefore unlikely options. Answer is
--target-- bus station
--input-- Question: Why is it difficult to tell what the weather might do sometimes? Options: A: clear,B: unpredictable,C: important to farmers,D: hot or cold,E: mild, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weather can be difficult to predict, which implies that it may change frequently and without warning. This could be due to a variety of factors such as atmospheric conditions, geography, and climate patterns. The other options, such as "clear" or "hot or cold", do not add much insight into why the weather might be difficult to predict. Answer is
--target-- unpredictable
--input-- Question: She felt like she never had any support, people always seemed to what? Options: A: marriage,B: ignore,C: let down,D: aid,E: neglect, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person did not feel supported by others and was often disappointed by their actions. "Let down" means to disappoint someone by failing to provide them with the expected or needed support, which makes it the best choice among the given options. "Ignore" and "neglect" are similar in meaning, but they do not convey the sense of being let down by someone who was expected to provide support. "Marriage" and "aid" are not related to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- let down
--input-- Question: What happens when someone trips when going for run? Options: A: falling down,B: sweating,C: get tired,D: flying,E: working out, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the subject tripped, which would likely result in them falling down.

--target-- falling down
--input-- Question: What might lock after someone drives in? Options: A: mouths,B: doorknob,C: gate,D: entrance,E: front door, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to has a mechanism that locks after someone drives in.

--target-- gate

Options: A: space lab,B: a state college,C: school,D: nanotechnology,E: university, Knowledge: Universities are widely regarded as institutions where higher education is provided, and as such, they usually offer courses in various disciplines, including science. While some of the other options, such as a state college or even a nanotechnology institution, may also offer courses in science, universities are generally associated with a broad range of academic fields. A space lab might suggest a place where scientific experiments are carried out in space, which is not what the question is asking. The option "school" is too general and does not provide any specific information. Answer is
--target-- university
--input-- Question: The lizard tried to warm itself by resting where? Options: A: porch,B: rocky areas,C: garden,D: shady spot,E: sunny place, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lizard was trying to warm itself up, which means it would need to be in a warm location. The term "sunny place" implies a location that receives direct sunlight, which is a source of warmth. The other options may not provide the warmth that the lizard needs, such as a shady spot or a porch, which may be cooler in temperature. Rocky areas and gardens are too general and do not provide any specific information related to the lizard's need for warmth. Answer is
--target-- sunny place
--input-- Question: If a cottage is above the cloud line, where is it? Options: A: village,B: rural area,C: mountains,D: fairy story,E: valley, Knowledge: The sentence mentions a specific location, above the cloud line, which is an altitude typically associated with high elevation areas such as mountains. A cottage in a village or rural area would not necessarily be above the cloud line, and a cottage in a valley would likely be surrounded by higher terrain. The mention of a fairy story does not provide any relevant information to determine the location of the cottage. Answer is
--target-- mountains

Options: A: overspending,B: standing in line,C: loss of money,D: run out of money,E: new shoes, Knowledge: Sally's conflicting feelings about shopping suggest that she may have a fear or anxiety about spending money, which could explain why it is painful for her to buy things even though she loves getting what she wants. The phrase "loss of money" suggests that Sally may feel a sense of financial insecurity or stress when she spends money, which would be consistent with her mixed feelings about shopping. The other options do not seem to fit with the context of the sentence or the possible reasons why Sally might find shopping painful. Answer is
--target-- loss of money
--input-- Question: What leads to someone going to to bed? Options: A: bad dreams,B: lazyness,C: get pregnant,D: sleepiness,E: rest, Knowledge: Going to bed is typically associated with the need for sleep, which is often characterized by feelings of sleepiness or tiredness. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Bad dreams may be a reason someone wakes up or has trouble falling asleep, but not necessarily a reason for going to bed. Laziness and getting pregnant are also not directly related to the act of going to bed. Rest could be a reason for someone to take a break or relax, but it is not necessarily a synonym for going to bed. Answer is
--target-- sleepiness

Options: A: creation of art,B: being slapped,C: laughter,D: embarrassment,E: people will understand, Knowledge: The question suggests that expressing oneself in simple terms is likely to have a certain outcome, and the most logical outcome would be that people will understand what is being expressed.

The other options have no apparent connection to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- people will understand
--input-- Question: Where can you play a board game with your family? Options: A: toy store,B: shelf,C: mall,D: house,E: cupboard, Knowledge: The question suggests that playing a board game with family is an activity typically done in a domestic setting, which is why the correct answer is "house." The other options do not fit the context of the question. A "toy store" and "shelf" are not places where one would typically play a board game, and a "mall" is a public space that is not typically associated with playing games. "Cupboard" is also not a suitable option, as it refers to a storage space, rather than a location for an activity. Answer is
--target-- house
--input-- Question: How does a police officer report his work? Options: A: charge person with crime,B: case,C: computer,D: direct traffic,E: retire, Knowledge: A police officer typically reports their work by creating a case file.

The other options do not seem to be related to reporting police work. Answer is
--target-- case
--input-- Question: People needed to find a red telephone box in the country side, where are they looking? Options: A: restaurant,B: england,C: city on street corner,D: the doctor,E: london, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the red telephone box is a common sight in the countryside of a particular country. The option "england" fits this context as red telephone boxes are commonly associated with England, particularly in rural areas. The other options, such as a restaurant or doctor, do not provide any context that would suggest the presence of a red telephone box. The option "city on street corner" may be a possible location for a phone box, but it contradicts the information that the sentence is set in the countryside. Answer is
--target-- england
--input-- Question: What does a confident person do? Options: A: feel important,B: own house,C: trust himself,D: know what time,E: cry, Knowledge: The word "confident" implies that someone is sure of themselves and their abilities. Therefore, it makes sense that a confident person would trust themselves and their decisions. Feeling important or owning a house do not necessarily relate to confidence, while crying suggests the opposite of confidence, which is vulnerability or insecurity. Knowing what time also does not relate to confidence. Answer is
--target-- trust himself
--input-- Question: James wants to go to a large church, what some might call a megachurch.  Where would he look for one of those? Options: A: city,B: commercial area,C: populated area,D: every town,E: christian community, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is looking for a large church, which is often referred to as a megachurch.

The characteristic mentioned in the sentence is that the person had a reputation for something, and the context implies that this characteristic is a positive one. Working hard is a highly desirable trait for an employee, as it shows dedication and a willingness to put in effort for the job. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be traits that would help someone get hired quickly. Answer is
--target-- working hard

--target-- teach each other
--input-- Question: What is killing likely to lead to for legal purposes? Options: A: guilty conscience,B: criminal trial,C: pleasure,D: retribution,E: a fun day out, Knowledge: The question is asking about the legal consequences of killing. Killing is usually considered a crime, which could result in a criminal trial.

--target-- criminal trial

--target-- encyclopedia

Options: A: slip on ice,B: fall down,C: fall over,D: sweat,E: maintain balance, Knowledge: The question suggests that learning to ski was a challenging activity, and the answer options provide possible difficulties that the person might have encountered. The option "maintain balance" is the most likely answer, as skiing requires a significant amount of balance and coordination to stay upright on the slopes. The other options, such as slipping on ice or falling down, are common occurrences while learning to ski but are not the most challenging aspect of the activity. Sweat is not directly relevant to the question and is not a difficulty that would typically be associated with learning to ski. Answer is
--target-- maintain balance

Options: A: canon,B: baseball,C: battle field,D: war zone,E: tornado, Knowledge: A tornado is a natural disaster that can cause high-speed winds and can pick up objects and hurl them through the air.

Options: A: upper respiratory tract,B: missile,C: boomerang,D: head,E: aircraft, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a weapon that has the specific capability of targeting the nose of an aircraft. This narrows down the choices to options that are weapons and can target a specific part of an aircraft.

The other options are not weapons or do not have the capability of targeting a specific part of an aircraft. Answer is
--target-- missile
--input-- Question: Spending too much time contemplating can lead to what kind of pain? Options: A: relaxation,B: deciding,C: regret,D: revelations,E: headache, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spending too much time contemplating something can lead to a negative outcome, specifically a type of pain. The options "relaxation" and "deciding" do not fit with this negative connotation, and "regret" also doesn't make sense as a result of merely contemplating something. "Revelations" could potentially fit, but it is not typically associated with pain. The remaining option, "headache," is a well-known effect of prolonged mental strain or excessive thinking, making it the correct option. Answer is
--target-- headache
--input-- Question: They burned the record, they were trying to do what to history? Options: A: compact disc,B: tape,C: rewrite,D: play music,E: erase, Knowledge: The verb "burned" suggests that they destroyed the record intentionally, and the phrase "trying to do what to history" implies that it was an attempt to alter or erase history.

--target-- erase

--input-- Question: Where is a dentist office likely to be? Options: A: hospital,B: office building,C: shopping mall,D: street,E: minnesota, Knowledge: Dentist offices are often located in office buildings, as these offer a professional atmosphere and convenient location for patients. Hospitals may have dental clinics, but they are typically located within the hospital complex and may not be accessible to the general public. Shopping malls and streets are also unlikely locations for a dental practice, as they do not offer the necessary privacy and infrastructure for medical procedures. The location of Minnesota is not relevant to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- office building
--input-- Question: The neolithic person was hungry, so what was their solution to the prblem? Options: A: thank god,B: hunt for food,C: feel humiliated,D: sleep,E: prepare to go, Knowledge: The sentence tells us that the neolithic person was hungry, which suggests that they needed to find a way to obtain food. Out of the given choices, "hunt for food" is the most logical solution to this problem. In prehistoric times, hunting and gathering were the primary ways of obtaining food, so it makes sense that this would be the neolithic person's solution. The other options do not provide a practical solution to the problem of hunger. Answer is
--target-- hunt for food
--input-- Question: Where can just a few passengers ride? Options: A: car,B: transportation,C: bus depot,D: vehicle,E: train station, Knowledge: The phrase "just a few passengers" suggests a small vehicle, which points to the option of a car.

Options: A: believe in jesus christ,B: forlorn,C: reconciled,D: go astray,E: live forever, Knowledge: Christianity teaches that believers can be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus Christ, and that death is not the end, but a transition to eternal life with God.

--target-- reconciled
--input-- Question: Where do you store your deodorant when not using it? Options: A: medicine cabinet,B: spray,C: medicine chest,D: own bathroom,E: shower, Knowledge: A medicine cabinet or medicine chest is typically where people store personal hygiene products such as deodorant, as well as other health and beauty items like toothbrushes, razors, and medications. The other options, such as using a spray or keeping it in the shower, do not make as much sense because they may decrease the shelf-life or effectiveness of the product. Keeping deodorant in one's own bathroom is plausible, but the most commonly associated storage location is the medicine cabinet or medicine chest. Answer is
--target-- medicine cabinet

Options: A: express emotion,B: quiet mind,C: beautifull,D: boredom,E: irritate, Knowledge: The sentence states that the person created music to share how they felt with another, which suggests that their goal was to convey their emotions through music. The option "express emotion" is the only one that aligns with this idea. The other options do not match the context of the sentence, for example, "quiet mind" and "beautiful" do not relate to creating music to share emotions. "Boredom" and "irritate" have a negative connotation, which seems unlikely to be the intended goal of the person creating the music. Answer is
--target-- express emotion
--input-- Question: What is food that is able to be eaten? Options: A: spoiled,B: necessary to live,C: edible,D: supermarket,E: unhealthy, Knowledge: The question is asking for a term that describes food that can be consumed without causing harm or discomfort. The term "edible" specifically refers to food that is safe and suitable for consumption. The other options do not accurately describe food that is safe for consumption. "Spoiled" implies that the food is rotten or inedible, "necessary to live" describes a basic need that food fulfills, "supermarket" is a place where food is sold, but it doesn't indicate whether the food is safe to eat or not, and "unhealthy" describes the quality of the food, but again, not its edibility. Answer is
--target-- edible
--input-- Question: When someone is pretending to cry they are? Options: A: acting,B: yelling,C: got injured,D: hurt,E: miserable, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is not actually crying but pretending to do so.

Options: A: wardrobe,B: jar,C: pocket,D: purse,E: backseat of car, Knowledge: The question mentions that the person is not a man, which indicates that they likely carry a purse or some type of bag with them. The question also suggests that the change will be used soon, which means it needs to be easily accessible. Putting change in a wardrobe or backseat of a car would not be practical as it would be difficult to access when needed. A jar is not a common place to store change outside of a home or office, so the most practical option is to put the change in a purse. Answer is
--target-- purse
--input-- Question: What is the worst part of playing games? Options: A: learning,B: happiness,C: competition,D: losing,E: fatigue, Knowledge: The question is asking about the negative aspect of playing games, and losing is a common frustration that many people experience when playing games. Learning may also be challenging, but it is not necessarily the "worst" part for everyone. Happiness and competition are positive aspects and do not fit the question's premise. Fatigue may be a physical challenge, but it is not necessarily the worst part of playing games for everyone. Answer is
--target-- losing

Options: A: sea,B: library,C: driveway,D: top of mountain,E: home, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mother's desired destination is associated with peace and quiet.

Gas stations and supermarkets may have coffee available for purchase, but they may not offer it in a way that allows the person to stay in their car. Grocery stores and friend's houses are unlikely places to stop for coffee if the person is looking for convenience. Answer is
--target-- fast food restaurant

Options: A: city hall,B: apartment building,C: mall,D: book of stories,E: tall building, Knowledge: The sentence describes a storey (or level) that contains multiple small restaurants. This is a common feature of a mall, which often has multiple levels with a variety of stores and restaurants. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. City halls typically contain government offices, an apartment building usually contains residential units, and a book of stories is a literary work, not a physical structure. Tall building is too broad and does not provide enough information. Answer is
--target-- mall
--input-- Question: What is a synonym for faith? Options: A: trust,B: move mountains,C: uplift,D: belief,E: experience, Knowledge: A synonym is a word that has a similar meaning to another word. In this case, the word "faith" means a strong belief in something, often without proof or evidence.

The other options do not have the same meaning as "faith" or are expressions that are used in a different context. Answer is
--target-- belief
--input-- Question: What type of plant is the tallest found on earth? Options: A: tree,B: orbit,C: pressure,D: space,E: solar system, Knowledge: The sentence is referring to the tallest plant found on Earth, and trees are the most common type of plant that can grow to great heights.

Options: A: speechless,B: voiceless,C: screaming,D: stumbling,E: muttering, Knowledge: The sentence implies that James is typically good at expressing himself, but on this particular occasion, he was struggling to communicate. The word "eloquent" suggests that James has a way with words, while "muttering" implies that he was struggling to articulate his thoughts. The other options (speechless, voiceless, screaming, stumbling) do not fit the context of the sentence because they do not describe someone who is trying to speak but having difficulty doing so.

--input-- Question: What might I use to grow a ficus on my patio? Options: A: tropical forest,B: arboretum,C: soil,D: pots,E: large pot, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a way to grow a ficus on their patio. The options "tropical forest" and "arboretum" refer to natural environments and do not provide any guidance on how to grow a plant in a specific location. "Soil" is important for growing plants, but it is not a suitable answer for this question because the speaker is looking for a container to grow the ficus in. "Large pot" is a more specific answer than "pots" and may be correct in some cases, but the size of the pot depends on the size of the plant and the space available on the patio. Therefore, the best answer is "pots," which suggests that the speaker should consider using multiple containers to grow the ficus on their patio. Answer is
--target-- pots
--input-- Question: Where would you not be able to find a diaphragm if there is no one in it? Options: A: drugstore,B: human,C: woman's body,D: human body,E: valve, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the word "diaphragm" refers to a form of birth control that is designed to be inserted into a woman's body. Therefore, the answer must be a location where a diaphragm would not be found if there is no one to insert it. A drugstore sells various forms of birth control, so it is not a viable option. The other options are all related to the human body, which is where a diaphragm would be found. Answer is
--target-- drugstore
--input-- Question: What businesses  serve liquor? Options: A: bar,B: cabinet,C: fraternity house,D: soft drink,E: state farm, Knowledge: Bars are establishments that serve alcoholic beverages, making them the most logical choice for businesses that serve liquor.

Soft drinks do not contain alcoholic content, so they cannot be considered as businesses that serve liquor. Answer is
--target-- bar
--input-- Question: The house wasn't connected to anything but rather was randomly plopped down in the woods, what did it need to have visitors? Options: A: city,B: residential area,C: milk man,D: street,E: subdivision, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the house is located in a remote area and not connected to any other buildings or infrastructure, which means that it would need a street to allow visitors to access it. A street provides a pathway and connection to other areas, which is necessary for visitors to reach the house. The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence, as a city, residential area, subdivision, or milk man would not necessarily help visitors access the house. Answer is
--target-- street

The other options, such as "complicated" or "square," do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- diverse

Options: A: salt,B: checkers,C: shopping mall,D: old west,E: meat store, Knowledge: The items listed are commonly associated with the time period of the Old West, such as whiskey and saddles for cowboys and grain for agriculture.

--target-- active
--input-- Question: As the company was concerned about profit, what were they looking to cut? Options: A: losses,B: expense,C: losing money,D: lose money,E: eat cake, Knowledge: The sentence makes it clear that the company was concerned about profit, which suggests they were looking to cut something that was costing them money. Expenses are costs associated with running a business, so it makes sense that they would be the target of the cost-cutting measures. "Losses", "losing money", and "lose money" all refer to the same thing and could be considered redundant answers. "Eat cake" is a nonsensical option that does not relate to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- expense

Options: A: basement,B: air,C: ceiling,D: water,E: sky, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something in the building is located at a significant height from the ground floor. This would usually be the ceiling of the building, which is above all the floors and can be very far from the ground level.

This suggests that the correct answer is "attempt to fly." The other options, such as "school together" or "hatred," do not make sense in the context of a fish flapping its fins in the air. Answer is
--target-- attempt to fly
--input-- Question: His boss told him that he would be speaking to the group that afternoon, he needed him to share his knowledge at the next what? Options: A: university,B: class,C: office party,D: book,E: meeting, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the boss asked the person to speak to a group that same afternoon. The word "meeting" is the only choice that fits this context, as all the others imply a different audience or setting. A "university" or "class" would suggest a more formal or educational environment, while an "office party" or "book" would imply a more casual or festive atmosphere. Therefore, "meeting" is the most fitting answer. Answer is
--target-- meeting

Muscles are the primary focus of weightlifting, and in order to gain muscle mass, one must consistently lift weights and challenge their body.

Answer is
--target-- muscles
--input-- Question: What happens when glass has been hit? Options: A: melted,B: break easily,C: shattering,D: hold water,E: many different colors, Knowledge: The word "hit" suggests forceful impact, which would cause glass to shatter rather than melt.

While glass can come in many different colors, this information is not relevant to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- shattering
--input-- Question: What can cause someone to want to go somewhere else because it's so smelly? Options: A: rose bush,B: go back,C: die,D: arrive there,E: fart, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a bad smell is causing someone to want to leave and the word "fart" specifically refers to a bodily function that can produce an unpleasant odor. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A rose bush, for example, is unlikely to emit a strong odor that would make someone want to leave, and "go back," "die," and "arrive there" are not related to the topic of bad smells. Answer is
--target-- fart
--input-- Question: What is the result of more people getting in line? Options: A: anxiety,B: wait turn,C: late,D: longer lines,E: have to wait for, Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a line and the more people who join the line, the result is (blank).

--target-- longer lines
--input-- Question: They really needed the information prisoner, so they did the least human thing and began to what the prisoner? Options: A: better himself,B: think and reason,C: have fever,D: hurt,E: torture, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the interrogators resorted to extreme measures to get the information they needed from the prisoner. The phrase "least human thing" implies that the action was cruel and inhumane, which rules out options like "better himself" and "think and reason". "Have fever" does not make sense in this context, leaving "hurt" and "torture" as the only plausible options. However, since the sentence specifies that they "began to", it is more likely that the correct answer is "torture" as this suggests a prolonged and intentional action rather than a one-time act of violence. Answer is
--target-- torture

Options: A: like,B: stupidity,C: relaxation,D: enjoyment,E: loved, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James watches films as a way to alleviate his high-strung state.

Options: A: uncommon,B: an adult,C: bad,D: special,E: hyperbolic, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the kids had low self-esteem and did not believe they were exceptional in any way. However, the teacher's statement contradicts this and implies that each child has unique qualities that make them special. The word "special" is commonly used in this context to encourage and motivate children. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- special

Options: A: make sick,B: doctor,C: water,D: stream,E: mouth, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hikers were concerned about the safety of the water they would encounter on their hike, which is why they brought a filtering straw. The context of the sentence implies that the hikers wanted to purify the water they drank to avoid getting sick. Therefore, the correct answer is water. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- water
--input-- Question: John put something on the night table.  But he forgot about it in the morning because it was unfamiliar. Where was he? Options: A: in jail,B: homes,C: hotel,D: furniture store,E: hallway, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John was in a temporary lodging, specifically a hotel room, where he placed an unfamiliar item on the night table. The other options do not make sense in this context. He is unlikely to be in jail or a furniture store, while hallway and even homes do not provide enough information to be definitive. Answer is
--target-- hotel
--input-- Question: James loved his workplace.  He was a cashier but he has a lot of leisure time which he spent browsing the new releases and bestsellers.  Where might he be working? Options: A: bookstore,B: pharmacy,C: supermarket,D: fast food restaurant,E: shop, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James's workplace has new releases and bestsellers, which are typically associated with bookstores. Additionally, the fact that James has leisure time to browse these titles suggests that he works in a relatively quiet environment, which is also a common characteristic of bookstores. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- bookstore
--input-- Question: What would someone be if he or she killed the biggest amount of people? Options: A: effusive,B: enabled,C: accidental,D: asomatous,E: detestable, Knowledge: The language in the question suggests that the act of killing a large number of people is morally repugnant or detestable. The word "detestable" means deserving intense dislike or hatred, which is an appropriate term for describing someone who has committed such a heinous act. The other options do not have any clear relation to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- detestable
--input-- Question: James searched his hotel for the return ticket.  He needed to find it before he left for where? Options: A: home,B: tickets,C: pocket,D: plane,E: airport, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that James needs to find his return ticket before he leaves for his next destination. The options "home," "tickets," and "pocket" do not make sense in this context because James is already at the hotel and is clearly searching for something specific. "Plane" could be a possible answer, but the sentence does not provide enough information to suggest that James needs to find his ticket before boarding the plane. "Airport" makes the most sense because it is the most likely place for James to leave from to return to his destination. Answer is
--target-- airport
--input-- Question: cats have how many apendages? Options: A: tail,B: whiskers,C: two eyes,D: four paws,E: four legs, Knowledge: Cats are known to have four legs, which are used for walking, running, jumping, and other forms of movement. While they also have other appendages such as tails and whiskers, these are not considered limbs or legs. Eyes are sensory organs, not limbs, and cats typically have two of them. Paws are the fleshy parts at the end of the legs that provide support and traction, but they are not separate appendages in themselves. Therefore, the correct answer is four legs. Answer is
--target-- four legs
--input-- Question: What do you need to make sure that you are at night while driving? Options: A: car,B: vehicle,C: distraction,D: being awake,E: napping, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is about driving safely at night. Being awake and alert while driving is crucial to ensuring safety on the road, especially at night when visibility may be reduced. The other options, such as having a car or vehicle, are necessary to drive, but do not directly relate to driving safely at night. Distractions and napping are potential hazards to safe driving, and should be avoided while driving. Answer is
--target-- being awake
--input-- Question: He needed to sign the papers, he got his good fountain pen from the sliding what? Options: A: calligrapher's hand,B: shirt pocket,C: desk drawer,D: portfolio,E: blotter, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needed to sign some papers and retrieved their fountain pen from a specific location. The options "calligrapher's hand," "shirt pocket," and "portfolio" do not make sense in the context of retrieving a pen. "Blotter" is not a location where someone would typically store a pen. This leaves "desk drawer" as the most likely option, as it is a common place to keep writing instruments. Answer is
--target-- desk drawer
--input-- Question: How do most people feel about a person they love? Options: A: popularity,B: know all,C: own house,D: care about,E: flu, Knowledge: The question is asking about emotions people feel towards someone they love.

--target-- care about

What might she do to better help people? Options: A: people helped,B: learning new skills,C: better circumstances,D: practice,E: happiness, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sarah went to school to become a nurse, which suggests that she has already acquired some skills in providing assistance to people. However, to better help people, the sentence implies that Sarah needs to continually improve her skills by learning new ones. The other options do not match the context of the sentence – "people helped" and "better circumstances" suggest outcomes rather than specific actions, "practice" may relate to skill-building but lacks the implication of seeking out new knowledge, and "happiness" is not clearly connected to the idea of providing assistance. Answer is
--target-- learning new skills
--input-- Question: The man is drunk and angry, what does he look to do to others? Options: A: appear ridiculous,B: fight,C: throw up,D: raise hell,E: walk off, Knowledge: The phrase "raise hell" typically refers to someone causing a disturbance or creating chaos, which would be in line with someone who is drunk and angry. The other options don't fit the context as well - appearing ridiculous, throwing up, and walking off may be potential consequences of being drunk, but they don't necessarily involve the person taking action against others. Fighting could be a possibility, but "raise hell" is a more appropriate phrase to use in this context. Answer is
--target-- raise hell
--input-- Question: Joe was running around his home and crossed a property boundary, running into a meticulously manicured rosebush and doing damage to both it and himself.  Where might the rosebush been located? Options: A: neighbor's yard,B: in the ground,C: field,D: nature,E: botanic garden, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Joe crossed a property boundary, which implies that he left his own property and entered someone else's. If he ran into a rosebush, it is likely that the bush was located in the neighbor's yard, which is a common place to find plants and landscaping. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- neighbor's yard
--input-- Question: The bald eagle can be a symbol, it elicits feeling of patriotism where? Options: A: forrest,B: grand canyon,C: canada,D: u.s,E: india, Knowledge: The bald eagle is a well-known symbol of the United States and is often associated with patriotism and national identity. The other choices do not have a clear connection to the bald eagle or its symbolism. Canada also uses the bald eagle as a symbol, but it is not as commonly associated with that country as it is with the U.S. Answer is
--target-- u.s
--input-- Question: What divider is often between two buildings that cars drive on? Options: A: fork in road,B: sidewalk,C: living room,D: street,E: binder, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a physical divider between two buildings that cars drive on. Sidewalks are typically located next to buildings and are not meant for cars, while a fork in the road would generally lead to different directions rather than dividing two buildings. A living room and binder are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is street. Answer is
--target-- street
--input-- Question: Many people gather together on Sundays, they tend to believe that earth is what? Options: A: one moon,B: flat,C: god's creation,D: milky way,E: universe, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people who gather together on Sundays share a belief about the origin of the Earth.

--target-- god's creation
--input-- Question: Billy is an animal, but he is alergic to trees. He hates them very much.  Still, he wants to have a picnic and can't stand the idea of buying food from a restaurant.  Where would he have his picnic? Options: A: addidas,B: north america,C: cafe,D: outside,E: woodland, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy wants to have a picnic outside because he doesn't want to buy food from a restaurant. The option "addidas" is a brand of clothing and not related to the context of the sentence. "North America" is a continent and not a location suitable for a picnic. "Cafe" implies buying food from a restaurant, which Billy doesn't want to do. "Woodland" would not be a suitable location for Billy because he is allergic to trees and hates them. Therefore, the correct answer is "outside." Answer is
--target-- outside
--input-- Question: Driving to work late is never pleasant, but you still shouldn't what? Options: A: listen to radio,B: sing,C: speed,D: anger,E: statue, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that driving to work late can be unpleasant, but it implies that speeding is an inappropriate action to take. Speeding can be dangerous and can result in accidents or legal consequences. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- speed
--input-- Question: Where is a dining area likely to be extravagant? Options: A: cruise ship,B: coming together,C: restaurant,D: mall,E: home, Knowledge: Cruise ships are known for providing luxury experiences for their passengers, with extravagant dining areas being a common feature. The limited space on a ship also means that every area needs to be utilized to the fullest, with dining areas often taking up a significant portion of the ship's interior. In contrast, a home or restaurant may have limited space and resources for extravagant dining areas, while a mall or "coming together" are not typically associated with dining areas at all. Answer is
--target-- cruise ship
--input-- Question: Where is the milky way? Options: A: fog,B: candy bar shelf,C: stars,D: space,E: refrigerator, Knowledge: The Milky Way is a term used to describe the galaxy in which our solar system resides.

The other choices are either unrelated or do not make sense in the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- space
--input-- Question: Danny liked to watch birds.  Birds don't have arms.  What do they have instead of arms? Options: A: beak,B: ability to fly,C: feet,D: wings,E: learn to fly, Knowledge: Birds are known for having wings, which they use to fly. The sentence mentions that birds do not have arms, which is a characteristic that distinguishes them from mammals. The other options either do not relate to the anatomy of birds or are redundant (such as "ability to fly," which is already implied by the mention of wings). Answer is
--target-- wings
--input-- Question: Why would a person go to school? Options: A: party,B: own house,C: more leisure time,D: successful in life,E: not feel pain, Knowledge: Going to school is often associated with obtaining an education or training that can lead to greater opportunities and success in life. While some individuals may go to school for socializing purposes, such as partying, the primary motivation for attending school is to gain knowledge and skills that can help one achieve their personal and professional goals. The other options, such as owning a house, having more leisure time, or not feeling pain, are not relevant factors in the decision to attend school. Answer is
--target-- successful in life
--input-- Question: What does your body do when walking? Options: A: exercise,B: move,C: getting somewhere,D: moving forward,E: keep moving forward, Knowledge: The verb "walking" implies movement, so the correct answer should also relate to movement. "Exercise" is too broad and does not specifically describe what the body does while walking. "Getting somewhere" and "moving forward" are both correct, but "move" is the most general and accurate answer that encompasses all types of walking. "Keep moving forward" implies a specific direction, which is not necessarily true for all walks. Answer is
--target-- move
--input-- Question: What could happen to a car when you press one of its pedals? Options: A: gain speed,B: go forward,C: rush away,D: go fast,E: suffer damage, Knowledge: Pressing a pedal in a car typically controls some aspect of the car's movement. In this case, the options "go forward," "rush away," and "go fast" all generally mean the same thing as "gain speed," but are less specific. "Suffer damage" does not accurately describe the effect of pressing a pedal, and is therefore not a correct answer. Answer is
--target-- gain speed
--input-- Question: The man owned a lot of guns, he thought more gun control was what? Options: A: controlled in canada,B: a great idea,C: bad,D: semiautomatic,E: very dangerous, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man who owned a lot of guns did not agree with the idea of more gun control. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be an option that is the opposite of "a great idea" or "controlled in Canada," which suggests gun control is a positive thing. The option "semiautomatic" refers to a type of gun and is not related to the man's opinion. The option "very dangerous" also does not fit the sentence because it describes the guns, not the man's opinion. Answer is
--target-- bad
--input-- Question: John was an important person, but when wronged he could be what? Options: A: trivial,B: petty,C: slight,D: negligible,E: impoite, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John had an important role or position, but when he was wronged, he could exhibit a negative trait. The word "petty" means to focus on small or insignificant details, which suggests that John may become irrationally fixated on minor wrongs or grievances. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not describe negative traits that John might exhibit when wronged. Answer is
--target-- petty
--input-- Question: The park had a refuse and littering problem, so they added another what? Options: A: tip,B: park officer,C: incinerator,D: dump,E: wastebasket, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the park was facing a problem with people leaving trash and litter around, and that they took measures to address this issue. The most logical solution would be to add more garbage cans or wastebaskets to the park, which would make it easier for visitors to dispose of their trash properly. The other options, such as a tip or incinerator, do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence. A park officer could help enforce littering rules, but they would not directly address the problem of trash disposal. Answer is
--target-- wastebasket
--input-- Question: When someone talk, what does someone else usually do to the person talking? Options: A: don't interrupt,B: sit silently,C: keep silent,D: be silent,E: listening, Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the focus is on what someone else does when someone is talking to them. The verb "talk" refers to speaking out loud, and the other options all suggest being silent or not interrupting, which is not specific enough to address the question. "Listening" is the best answer as it directly correlates to the act of someone speaking and someone else paying attention to what they are saying. Answer is
--target-- listening
--input-- Question: What type of area would you be entering if dressed in a suit when putting your car in a parking lot? Options: A: urban area,B: amusement park,C: house,D: business district,E: shopping center, Knowledge: The phrase "dressed in a suit" suggests a formal attire typically worn for business or professional settings. Therefore, the most likely option is a business district, which is an area with many office buildings and commercial activities. The other options do not necessarily require formal attire, and would not necessarily warrant wearing a suit to park your car. Answer is
--target-- business district
--input-- Question: What is a good place for a potato to mix with other veggies? Options: A: beef stew,B: restaurants,C: garden,D: steak house,E: cooking pot, Knowledge: In many cultures, potatoes are a common ingredient in beef stew. The combination of potatoes and beef creates a hearty and filling meal, and the potatoes absorb the flavors of the other vegetables and spices in the stew. Restaurants, steak houses and gardens do not provide any specific context related to mixing potatoes with other veggies, while cooking pot is a generic term that does not suggest any particular dish or recipe. Answer is
--target-- beef stew
--input-- Question: What can you do before taking final exams to help with them? Options: A: study,B: sweat,C: graduation,D: cheat,E: sleep, Knowledge: Final exams are typically associated with the need to prepare and review material beforehand. Studying is the most common way to do this, and is widely known as the most effective way to improve test results. Sweating is not likely to help with exams, and cheating is unethical and can lead to serious consequences. Graduation is a separate event that occurs after exams are taken, and sleeping may be helpful in some cases but is not a guaranteed way to improve exam performance. Answer is
--target-- study

Options: A: getting hurt,B: ocean,C: stand up,D: standing,E: summer, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that locking one's knees while standing may cause someone to faint or fall.

--target-- standing

Options: A: ike director,B: have fun,C: see what happens,D: interesting,E: pass time, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when someone is deeply involved while watching a film, it means that the film is engaging and captivating.

The other options do not necessarily suggest an emotional connection with the film or a high level of engagement. Answer is
--target-- interesting
--input-- Question: He had a great time with his what brother? Options: A: small,B: horrible,C: awful,D: little,E: terrible, Knowledge: The adjective "little" is often used to describe a younger sibling, indicating that the speaker had a good time with their younger brother. The other adjectives have negative connotations and would not be used to describe a positive experience, making "little" the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- little
--input-- Question: When you are relaxing with friends, what are you doing if you discuss anything? Options: A: side with,B: hang out,C: go to the movies,D: understand each other,E: talking about, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the activity being done while relaxing with friends involves having a conversation or discussion, which is most closely associated with the option "talking about."

--input-- Question: While eating a hamburger with friends, what are people trying to do? Options: A: have fun,B: indigestion,C: death,D: tasty,E: gas, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that people are eating a hamburger with friends, which typically implies a social activity. Eating with friends is often associated with having a good time and enjoying each other's company, which is why "having fun" is the correct answer. The other options, such as "indigestion," "death," "tasty," and "gas," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be correct. Answer is
--target-- have fun
--input-- Question: Humans often have hunting instincts, so what do they do? Options: A: excrete,B: cry,C: play piano,D: make mistakes,E: eat meat, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that humans have a natural inclination to hunt, which is typically done for food.

--target-- eat meat
--input-- Question: Why would someone visit many stores before buying products? Options: A: online shopping,B: running out of money,C: debt,D: comparison shopping,E: overstocking, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is visiting multiple stores with the intention of buying products. However, the reason for doing so is not immediately clear. Among the options provided, only comparison shopping would make sense in this context. Comparison shopping involves visiting multiple stores to compare prices, features, and quality of products in order to make an informed decision about what to buy. The other options (online shopping, running out of money, debt, overstocking) do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- comparison shopping
--input-- Question: What entity would have a fire extinguisher in their boardroom? Options: A: boat,B: apartment,C: public building,D: most businesses,E: chemistry lab, Knowledge: Fire extinguishers are typically found in buildings and spaces where a fire could occur, and most businesses are required by law to have them on hand. Boat and apartment may have fire extinguishers on board/in units, but it is unlikely for them to have one in their boardrooms specifically. Public buildings may have them, but not all of them do, and it is less common for them to have one in a boardroom. A chemistry lab would likely have a fire extinguisher as well, but again, it is less likely to be in their boardroom specifically. Answer is
--target-- most businesses
--input-- Question: What is someone likely to do to someone accused of killing people they love? Options: A: go home,B: sadness,C: retaliation,D: remorse,E: going to jail, Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone has been accused of killing people that another person loves, which suggests that the person who loves the victims may seek revenge or retaliation against the accused. Retaliation is a common reaction to betrayal or harm, especially if the person feels a strong emotional connection to the victims. "Go home", "sadness", "remorse", and "going to jail" are not logical choices for a person's reaction to someone accused of killing their loved ones. Answer is
--target-- retaliation
--input-- Question: A person doesn't have pants that fit, what should he do? Options: A: buy a monkey,B: let himself go,C: buy clothes,D: bank money,E: catch cold, Knowledge: The problem presented in the question is that the person doesn't have pants that fit.

--input-- Question: Horses are big animals that get a lot of exercise.  Because he this, they need to do what? Options: A: run quickly,B: pull wagon,C: go away,D: drink water,E: eat carrots, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that horses require a lot of energy to function properly due to their size and amount of exercise they get. As a result, they need to hydrate themselves properly by drinking water. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence as running quickly or pulling a wagon are forms of exercise that horses are already getting, going away is not a solution or a requirement, and eating carrots does not address the issue of hydration. Answer is
--target-- drink water
--input-- Question: Where would you find a sloth that is not afraid of being hunted? Options: A: forest canopy,B: nature preserve,C: zoo,D: tropical rainforest,E: commercial, Knowledge: The question implies that sloths are commonly hunted, so the answer that makes sense is a location where hunting is prohibited or at least discouraged. A nature preserve is a protected area where animals can live without human interference, so it is the most likely option. A forest canopy and a tropical rainforest are both habitats where sloths live, but they do not provide protection from hunting. A zoo is a controlled environment where animals are kept in captivity, so it does not fit the description of a sloth that is not afraid of being hunted. "Commercial" is not a location where sloths would naturally live. Answer is
--target-- nature preserve
--input-- Question: What is the biggest group of people on the east coast where you will find skyscrapers? Options: A: new york city,B: big city,C: large city,D: metropolis,E: beach, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a group of people on the east coast where there are many skyscrapers.

--target-- new york city
--input-- Question: The students helped build the backdrop, it was just one of the parts of putting on their little what? Options: A: theater,B: theatre,C: stage show,D: photography studio,E: mini project, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the students were involved in some kind of performance, as they were building a backdrop for it. Both "theater" and "stage show" are viable options, but "theater" is spelled differently in British English ("theatre"). "Photography studio" and "mini project" do not make sense in the context of building a backdrop for a performance. Answer is
--target-- stage show
--input-- Question: What is a convenient way for a farmer to preserve their crops? Options: A: can produce,B: harvestation,C: water plants,D: produce food,E: rise early, Knowledge: Canning is a common method of preserving crops for long periods of time. It involves sealing food in an airtight container, like a can, and then heating the can to destroy any bacteria or microorganisms that might cause spoilage.

Answer is
--target-- can produce

Options: A: large office,B: at hotel,C: building,D: real estate office,E: store room, Knowledge: The context suggests that John is trying to make a sale, and he is talking to someone who can help him with that. The fact that he is willing to lower the price also suggests that he is involved in real estate sales, where price negotiations are common. The other options do not make sense in the given context. Answer is
--target-- real estate office

Options: A: sit down,B: would read,C: reading,D: remember,E: write down, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the journalist had a straightforward approach to their work, and the phrase "see story" implies that they were able to quickly identify the key elements of a story. The phrase "write down" suggests that the journalist would take notes or record their observations in order to write their story later. The other options (sit down, would read, reading, remember) do not fit the context of the sentence as well. Answer is
--target-- write down
--input-- Question: The stove had to be moved so the kitchen could be remodeled, where did it go? Options: A: apartment,B: living room,C: boiling liquids like water,D: friend's house,E: restroom, Knowledge: The sentence states that the stove had to be moved due to a kitchen remodel, which implies that the stove was temporarily relocated within the same living space. The most likely option from the given choices is the living room, as it is usually the largest open area in a home where a stove could be placed. The other options, such as apartment, friend's house, and restroom, do not fit the context of the sentence since they are not within the same living space. The option of boiling liquids like water is also unrelated since it does not provide a clear answer to where the stove was moved to. Answer is
--target-- living room

--target-- take pills

These events often have concession stands selling hot dogs and other snacks for attendees to enjoy while watching the game. While hot dogs may be sold in some of the other places listed, such as a park or a theme park like Disneyland, they are not typically associated with those locations as strongly as they are with sporting events. Answer is
--target-- sporting event

Options: A: emotional distress,B: bad feelings,C: richer,D: depression,E: guilty, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the husband received money (alimony) after the divorce. Since he never worked, it can be inferred that the money he received would make him "richer." The other options do not make logical sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- richer
--input-- Question: WHere do you typically buy prescription suntan lotion? Options: A: beach bag,B: grocery store,C: pharmacy,D: shop,E: tanning salon, Knowledge: Prescription suntan lotion is typically only available through a pharmacy, as it requires a prescription from a doctor. The other options, such as a grocery store or tanning salon, do not typically carry prescription medications.

--target-- pharmacy
--input-- Question: If you like your jeans already broken in where should you shop? Options: A: thrift store,B: clothing store,C: outside,D: closet,E: gap, Knowledge: The phrase "broken in" suggests that the person wants jeans that have already been worn and have a more comfortable, relaxed fit. Thrift stores are known for selling secondhand clothing, including items that may have already been broken in by their previous owners. Clothing stores may sell new, stiff jeans that have not yet been worn in, and the options of outside and closet don't make sense in the context of the question. Gap is a specific clothing store, but it does not necessarily specialize in selling pre-worn or broken-in clothing. Answer is
--target-- thrift store
--input-- Question: Where would you put a ficus if you do not want it to damage your floor? Options: A: dictionary,B: middle east,C: earth,D: container,E: tropical forest, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ficus can potentially damage the floor, which indicates that it is a living plant. The correct answer would be a container, as this is a common way to pot plants in order to protect surfaces from damage.

--input-- Question: What does someone committing suicide want to do? Options: A: cut wrist,B: swimming,C: dying,D: die,E: interruption, Knowledge: Suicide is an intentional act of taking one's own life. Therefore, the most appropriate option would be "die" as it accurately describes the intention of the person committing suicide. The other options do not match the context of the question and may even be considered insensitive or inappropriate. Cutting one's wrist is a form of self-harm, and swimming or interruption do not relate to suicide. Answer is
--target-- die

Options: A: history studies,B: geography,C: religion,D: math,E: ghosts, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that science and another field are often viewed as conflicting or opposing, but many people find comfort in both. The other options, such as history studies, geography, math, and ghosts, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.

Options: A: ancient history,B: recent,C: stone age,D: storybook,E: ancient times, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the mammoth is currently extinct, and cloning it would bring it back to life. The term "ancient history" refers to something that happened a long time ago, and since mammoths are extinct, they are considered to be a part of ancient history.

Options: A: ruled,B: harsh,C: abrasive,D: hard,E: sensible, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the troublemaker anticipated a lenient punishment but received a severe or harsh one instead.

Options: A: consumable,B: medicine,C: nutrient,D: dosage,E: antidote, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone has just consumed poison and another person is now taunting them. Given this context, it is logical to assume that the mockingly displayed item is likely to be connected to the poison, such as an antidote to counteract the effects of the poison.

Options: A: theatre,B: subway station,C: train station,D: amusement park,E: store, Knowledge: Turnstiles are commonly used in locations where access needs to be controlled, such as ticketed events or transportation stations.

--target-- amusement park
--input-- Question: Punishing innocent people with the death penalty should cause what? Options: A: public outrage,B: get angry,C: going to jail,D: feel guilty,E: hatred, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that punishing innocent people with the death penalty is a morally reprehensible act that is likely to cause a negative public reaction.

--target-- public outrage
--input-- Question: The fingers do this with the hand. What is it? Options: A: sign language,B: scratch,C: articulate,D: cup water,E: soft, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity involving fingers and hands is related to movement or articulation. "Scratch," "cup water," and "soft" do not involve movement or articulation of the fingers in relation to the hand. "Sign language" is a possibility, but the sentence does not provide any other context or clues that suggest sign language would be the correct answer. Therefore, "articulate" is the best fit as it means to move the joints of the body, such as the fingers, in a precise and flexible way. Answer is
--target-- articulate
--input-- Question: Where is the best place to keep personal lettuce? Options: A: supermarket,B: farmer's market,C: pantry,D: refrigerator,E: salad, Knowledge: Lettuce is a perishable vegetable that can wilt and spoil easily if not stored properly. The best place to store lettuce is in a refrigerator, which helps to keep it cool and crisp. The other options are not suitable for storing lettuce, as they do not provide the same level of temperature control and protection from moisture that a refrigerator does. The supermarket and farmer's market are places where lettuce is purchased, not stored. The pantry is often too warm and dry for lettuce, and salad is a dish that contains lettuce, but not a storage location. Answer is
--target-- refrigerator

Options: A: street,B: windowsill,C: disneyland,D: grow lights,E: summer, Knowledge: The question suggests that a person owns a plant, which implies that the plant is likely located inside their home. Since plants require sunlight to grow, it is likely that the person has placed the plant on a windowsill to receive natural sunlight. The other options, such as street, Disneyland, or summer, do not provide any information about where the plant may be located or where sunlight may be falling on it. Grow lights may be used as an alternative to natural sunlight, but it is not mentioned in the question. Answer is
--target-- windowsill

Options: A: empowerment,B: misunderstanding,C: embarrassment,D: repercussions,E: falling down, Knowledge: The question asks for a positive effect of expressing yourself, which means we should look for an option that has a positive connotation. Empowerment is a positive term that suggests a sense of confidence and control.

The other options have negative connotations and are unlikely to be positive effects of expressing yourself. Answer is

Options: A: cellar,B: car,C: garage,D: closet,E: post office, Knowledge: The sentence implies that Danny is storing something he wants to access easily but doesn't want it in the way. A closet is a logical option because it can be easily accessed but is out of the way.

Answer is
--target-- closet

The other options, such as train or wedding, do not provide these services.

Entertainment is also a vague option that may or may not include bar service or accommodations. Answer is

The correct answer must be a location where mail is collected and processed, such as a post office. Envelopes are the items that letters are sent in, but they are not the location where mail is processed. A mailbox or mail box is where mail is delivered, but it is not where it is processed or forwarded. The front door is not a location where mail is processed or delivered, it is the entrance to a building or house. Answer is

A nursery rhyme fits this description, as they are often simple and catchy tunes that are enjoyable for children.

Answer is
--target-- nursery rhyme

Options: A: spaceship,B: suface of moon,C: space shuttle,D: at the,E: orbit, Knowledge: The question is asking about where astronauts who miss a landing might end up, suggesting that they did not reach their intended destination. The option "spaceship" is not a likely answer, as astronauts would already be in a spaceship to travel to their destination. The option "surface of moon" may be a possibility, but the context of the question suggests that the astronauts are still in space. The option "space shuttle" is not a likely answer, as astronauts would have to be in a shuttle to travel to their destination in the first place. The option "at the" is not a complete sentence and does not make sense in the context of the question. The option "orbit" makes the most sense, as astronauts who miss a landing could end up orbiting the moon, Earth, or another celestial body until they are rescued or can make it back to their intended destination. Answer is
--target-- orbit

Options: A: countryside,B: channels,C: amazon basin,D: temperate zone,E: national park, Knowledge: The use of the word "tropical" suggests that the river is flowing into a region known for its high biodiversity and dense vegetation, which is commonly associated with the Amazon basin. The other options do not fit the description of a tropical forest or a region known for high biodiversity.

Options: A: communing,B: reproducing,C: palpitations,D: perspiration,E: respiration, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is asking about how living things continue their species, which can be interpreted as how they procreate or produce offspring. The word "reproducing" directly relates to this idea. The other answer choices do not fit the context of the question, as "communing" refers to socializing, "palpitations" refers to heartbeats, "perspiration" refers to sweating, and "respiration" refers to breathing. Answer is

Options: A: were very tired,B: rested,C: worked all day,D: exhausted,E: muscles tired, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker hasn't had rest recently, which implies that they may be feeling fatigued or tired. The option "exhausted" best captures this sense of extreme tiredness. The other options, such as "rested" or "muscles tired," do not convey the same level of fatigue as "exhausted."

--target-- exhausted

Options: A: unemployment,B: earn money,C: sleeping,D: relaxation,E: do nothing, Knowledge: The sentence implies that work is difficult, which can make one appreciate moments of rest or leisure. "Relaxation" is the most fitting choice among the options provided, as it relates directly to the idea of finding relief from the daily grind of work. "Unemployment" and "do nothing" are not necessarily positive states, and "earn money" is not a direct contrast to the idea of work being challenging. "Sleeping" may provide some relief, but it does not capture the idea of enjoying leisure time. Answer is

Options: A: lady's boudoir,B: suitcase,C: bedroom drawer,D: safe deposit box,E: department store, Knowledge: The question is asking where to store jewelry if you do not plan to use it soon. A safe deposit box is a secure place to store valuable items, including jewelry, when they are not being used or worn. A lady's boudoir or bedroom drawer may be common places to store jewelry at home, but they may not be as secure as a safe deposit box. A suitcase is not a secure or recommended storage option for valuable items. A department store is not an appropriate storage location as it is a retail establishment, not a storage facility. Answer is

--input-- Question: What is likely true about a dog that escapes regularly? Options: A: very smart,B: very loyal,C: tired,D: friendly,E: faithful, Knowledge: The fact that the dog is able to escape regularly suggests that it is intelligent and perhaps resourceful. Dogs that are highly intelligent may be more prone to escaping because they have a greater awareness of their surroundings and are curious about exploring beyond their normal boundaries. The other options (loyal, tired, friendly, faithful) do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence and are not necessarily linked to a dog that escapes regularly. Answer is
--target-- very smart

Options: A: headaches,B: sidetracked,C: then have,D: disappointment,E: being happy, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the worker is experiencing negative health effects due to poor ventilation, which is a common cause of headaches.

Options: A: emotional,B: very adaptable,C: left or right handed,D: male or female,E: selfish, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the answer is related to how humans are born, and specifically mentions two ways. Male and female are the two primary biological sexes that humans are born as, which makes them the correct answer.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

--input-- Question: How might I procure what I need to eat? Options: A: make food,B: find food,C: prepare food,D: buy food,E: check your cat's mouth, Knowledge: The other options do not relate to the process of obtaining food in the same way as "buy food." Making food and preparing food require ingredients, which would have to be obtained somehow. Although finding food in the wild is a possibility, the sentence suggests that the person is actively seeking a solution to their hunger rather than relying on chance. Checking a cat's mouth has nothing to do with procuring food for oneself. Answer is
--target-- buy food

Options: A: fairness,B: candies,C: compliments,D: well fed,E: arguements, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is dissatisfied with the unequal distribution of cake slices.

Options: A: learn new things,B: memorize,C: falling asleep,D: waking up,E: having fun, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reading material is intended to aid in sleep, which is a common reason people read before bed.

Options: A: mouth wash,B: breathlessness,C: losing weight,D: better health,E: satisfaction, Knowledge: The sentence implies that going for a run has some specific benefit which is not related to illness. One potential benefit of running that is often cited is weight loss, so this choice is likely the correct answer. Breathlessness and satisfaction could be side effects of running, but they do not directly explain why someone would choose to go for a run if they are not ill. Mouth wash and better health are not related to running in any obvious way. Answer is

The other options suggest actions that the police or investigator could take in order to solve the case, but none of them specifically address the hope of uncovering the truth. Additionally, "gathering facts" and "gathering evidence" are similar to each other and are not distinct enough options to be both correct. Answer is

None of the other options offer a viable solution for how the two groups can achieve their goal of vacationing somewhere else for free. Answer is

Rivalry is a common result of competition, as each team tries to outperform the other. Accomplishment is not likely to have developed between the teams in this context, as they were competing against each other rather than working together towards a common goal.

Clogged arteries, indigestion, and weight gain are all negative consequences associated with consuming too much fast food, which suggests they are not typically reasons why people like eating hamburgers. "Having fun" is also a possible reason, as hamburgers are a common food choice for social gatherings and backyard BBQs, but it is not mentioned in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- tasty
--input-- Question: What happens when you try to help someone but make it worse? Options: A: succeed,B: do nothing,C: anticipate,D: hinder,E: hurting, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action of trying to help someone has had a negative effect, which is commonly referred to as "hindering" their progress or situation. The other options do not match the context of the sentence. Succeed and anticipate both suggest a positive outcome, while do nothing suggests no effect at all. Hurting may also suggest a negative outcome, but it does not match the context of trying to help someone. Answer is
--target-- hinder
--input-- Question: Where do older people sometimes want to hear the singer more than the music? Options: A: elevator,B: opera,C: carnival,D: music hall,E: night club, Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a specific type of venue or event where older people are more likely to appreciate the singer's performance than the actual music being played. Opera is a type of musical performance that places a strong emphasis on the vocal performance of the lead singers, and many older people may appreciate the skill and technique required to perform in this style. The other options do not have a strong association with the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- opera
--input-- Question: Alexa needed a safe place to put her acoustic guitar when she wasn't playing it.  Where might she put it? Options: A: drawer,B: music shop,C: house,D: studio,E: closet, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Alexa is looking for a safe and secure place to store her acoustic guitar when she is not playing it. Among the choices provided, a closet would be the best option as it provides privacy and security, and the guitar can be safely stored away from any potential hazards that could damage it. The other options, such as a drawer, music shop, house, or studio, may not offer the same level of security or privacy for Alexa's guitar. Answer is
--target-- closet
--input-- Question: What do you physically do to someone that you love? Options: A: kiss,B: kill,C: forgive,D: paint,E: please parents, Knowledge: The question is asking for a physical action associated with love. Kissing is a well-known expression of love and affection, frequently used in romantic relationships, familial relationships, and even friendships. The other options, such as killing or painting, are not typically associated with expressions of love. Forgiving or pleasing parents may be actions taken out of love, but they are not physical expressions like kissing. Answer is
--target-- kiss
--input-- Question: What do people watch television to become? Options: A: see favorite show,B: be quiet,C: get comfortable,D: you're bored,E: entertained, Knowledge: Watching television is often associated with entertainment, as people tune in to see their favorite shows or programs that are designed to provide amusement or diversion from daily life. While it is true that some people may watch television to be quiet or get comfortable, these reasons do not fully capture the main purpose of watching television, which is to be entertained. Additionally, the option "you're bored" may be a reason someone watches television, but it is not a goal or outcome that someone hopes to achieve. Answer is
--target-- entertained
--input-- Question: How might praying make someone feel as they wait for an outcome? Options: A: relief,B: meditation,C: confusing god,D: being comforted,E: contemplation, Knowledge: The act of praying is often associated with seeking comfort and guidance from a higher power. Therefore, it is likely that someone who is praying while waiting for an outcome may feel comforted by the belief that they are not alone and that their prayer may be answered. The other options may be possible outcomes of praying in different contexts, but they do not necessarily apply to the specific question being asked. Answer is
--target-- being comforted
--input-- Question: What is a risk of going on vacation? Options: A: overspending,B: staying there,C: relaxing,D: pleasant thoughts,E: enjoy, Knowledge: Going on vacation can be enjoyable and relaxing, but it also comes with potential risks. One common risk is overspending, as vacations often involve expenses for transportation, accommodations, food, and activities. This can lead to financial stress or debt if not planned and managed carefully. The other options in the choices are not risks, but rather outcomes or feelings associated with going on vacation. Answer is
--target-- overspending
--input-- Question: The man wanted to have food ready for the work week, so he decided to what his meals ahead of time? Options: A: chew,B: eating,C: digest,D: prepare,E: eat food, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the man wanted to have food ready for the work week, which suggests that he would need to prepare his meals in advance. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence: chewing and eating both refer to the act of consuming food, while digesting is a natural bodily process that occurs after eating. Answer is
--target-- prepare
--input-- Question: Where would someone find freshest possible eggs? Options: A: supermarket,B: grocery store,C: in a salad,D: bird's nest,E: chicken coop, Knowledge: Eggs are typically freshest when they are collected directly from the source, which would be a chicken coop in this case. Supermarkets and grocery stores may sell fresh eggs that are still relatively close to their collection date, but they may not be as fresh as eggs from a chicken coop. Eggs would not typically be found in a salad as a whole, and certainly not fresh ones. Similarly, eggs would not be found in a bird's nest as they would likely already be hatched and gone. Answer is
--target-- chicken coop
--input-- Question: Where will you store a bowl while not in use? Options: A: apartment,B: outside,C: dishwasher,D: cabinet,E: restaurant, Knowledge: Cabinets are a common storage solution for bowls in homes and kitchens. They provide a secure and protected space for the bowl, while keeping it easily accessible for future use. The other options are not viable storage locations for a bowl - apartments are not specific enough, outside leaves the bowl exposed to the elements, the dishwasher is not a storage solution, and a restaurant would not be a personal storage location. Answer is
--target-- cabinet
--input-- Question: The child wanted to test electricity, so what did he feel as a result? Options: A: cause fire,B: shock,C: short fuse,D: kill if used improperly,E: produce heat, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child was experimenting with electricity, which can be dangerous if not handled properly. The word "feel" implies that the child experienced a physical sensation as a result of their experiment. "Shock" is the most common physical sensation associated with electricity and is the correct answer. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential dangers of experimenting with electricity. Answer is
--target-- shock
--input-- Question: Although he didn't reply to the email, what did he do with it since he found it funny? Options: A: ignore,B: delete,C: forward,D: question,E: ask, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person found the email funny, but did not reply to it. The word "although" also implies that the person did something else with the email. Of the choices provided, "forward" is the most likely option, as the person may have wanted to share the funny email with someone else. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as they do not involve any action being taken with the email. Answer is
--target-- forward
--input-- Question: Dad is putting away folding chairs after a party, where does he store them? Options: A: church,B: garage,C: attic,D: room,E: closet, Knowledge: In the context of the sentence, it's reasonable to assume that the folding chairs are larger items that require some space. Churches, attics, rooms, and closets are typically not large enough to store multiple folding chairs. On the other hand, garages are often used for storage of larger items like cars, bicycles, and outdoor equipment, making it the most likely option for storing folding chairs after a party. Answer is
--target-- garage
--input-- Question: If you see policemen outside wearing safety vest and holding flashlights, what are they doing? Options: A: corner thief,B: help,C: searching in dark,D: direct traffic,E: hurry along, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the policemen are wearing safety vests and holding flashlights, which are common tools used for directing traffic. This would be especially likely if the policemen were standing at an intersection or near a construction site, where traffic needs to be redirected for safety reasons. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- direct traffic
--input-- Question: What is a psychological benefit of having fun? Options: A: glee,B: stress relief,C: smiling,D: twinkle,E: may laugh, Knowledge: The question is asking about a psychological benefit of having fun, which implies that the answer should be related to mental or emotional well-being. Out of the options provided, stress relief is the most directly linked to this theme. Studies show that having fun and engaging in enjoyable activities can help to reduce stress levels and improve mood. The other options (glee, smiling, twinkle, may laugh) are related to happiness or expression of emotions, but they do not specifically address the psychological benefits of having fun. Answer is
--target-- stress relief
--input-- Question: The school has three wings and had enough space for 5000 students. How might one describe it? Options: A: buffalo,B: hospital,C: birdhouse,D: mansion,E: large building, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the school has three wings and enough space for 5000 students, which implies that it is a large building capable of accommodating a significant number of people. The other choices, such as buffalo, hospital, birdhouse, and mansion, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to describe a school in this manner. Answer is
--target-- large building
--input-- Question: Where are you if you're hearing a bass clarinet accompanying people singing in German? Options: A: orchestra,B: school band,C: music store,D: opera house,E: symphony, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the setting is one where a musical performance is being held, as there are people singing and a bass clarinet playing. Out of the choices provided, an opera house is the most likely setting for a performance involving singing and orchestral instruments like the bass clarinet. The other options, such as a school band or a music store, do not fit the context of the sentence as well. Answer is
--target-- opera house
--input-- Question: The farmer is making grow a tomato, what does he specialize? Options: A: flowering,B: barn,C: growth,D: plants,E: more of, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the farmer is growing a specific type of plant, which is a tomato. Therefore, it can be inferred that the farmer specializes in cultivating plants. The other choices, such as flowering or barn, do not have any logical connection to the context of the sentence. The word "growth" could be a potential answer, but it is not specific enough as it does not mention what is growing. Answer is
--target-- plants
--input-- Question: James was planning a vacation. he was doing this because he worked hard and needed something. What did he need? Options: A: stock options,B: arguments,C: spending money,D: relaxation,E: enjoying, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was planning a vacation as a way to fulfill a need he had. The context implies that this need was related to his work and a desire to take a break or unwind. The option "relaxation" fits this context, whereas the other options do not directly relate to the need or reason mentioned in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- relaxation
--input-- Question: The alley cats were all beginning to gather together, but one loud crash sent them all what? Options: A: disburse,B: charming,C: scattering,D: spread,E: dispense, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the alley cats were all gathering together, but then something caused them to suddenly move or scatter in different directions. The word "scatter" is a synonym of "disperse" or "spread out," which fits the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the sudden and chaotic movement described in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- scattering
--input-- Question: What is something that comes from your voice? Options: A: volume,B: loud,C: being heard,D: beautiful,E: sound, Knowledge: The question is asking for something that is produced by the voice, and the word "sound" is a direct result of vibrations in the vocal cords. Volume and loudness both refer to the level of sound produced, while being heard is more of a passive action that results from the sound being produced. "Beautiful" is subjective and not necessarily related to the production of sound itself. Answer is
--target-- sound
--input-- Question: What might someone be trying to achieve by getting wet? Options: A: could,B: get cold,C: shrinking,D: cool off,E: shower, Knowledge: The act of getting wet is often associated with trying to achieve a cooling effect. When we get wet, whether through swimming or taking a shower, the water helps to lower our body temperature by conducting heat away from our skin. The option "get cold" may seem like a viable choice given the context, but it implies a passive state rather than an active pursuit. "Shrinking" is not a practical goal for most people when getting wet, and "shower" is a specific way of getting wet rather than a general purpose. Answer is
--target-- cool off
--input-- Question: Where would the heifer go to join her herd? Options: A: slaughterhouse,B: cow palace,C: dairy farm,D: cow pasture,E: barnyard, Knowledge: The word "herd" refers to a group of grazing animals, typically cows or other livestock. The options "slaughterhouse" and "dairy farm" suggest that the heifer will be used for meat or milk production, which is not mentioned in the question. "Cow palace" is not a typical term used to describe a place where cows graze or live. "Barnyard" could be a possibility, but it is a more general term that could refer to any area where livestock are kept, while "cow pasture" specifically refers to an open grazing area for cows. Answer is
--target-- cow pasture
--input-- Question: The audience sits enthralled watching a spectacular battle full of shooting and explosions.  Where is the audience most likely to be? Options: A: church,B: hockey game,C: movie theater,D: new york stadium,E: stadium, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that what the audience is watching is a form of entertainment. Out of the given choices, only a movie theater is typically associated with showing movies that contain scenes of battles, shooting, and explosions. The other options, such as a church or a hockey game, do not typically involve this type of content. While stadiums may host events that feature battles or explosions, the mention of "New York Stadium" in particular is unlikely to be relevant to the sentence. Answer is
--target-- movie theater
--input-- Question: When not playing your mandolin, where would you store it? Options: A: closet,B: musical instrument store,C: instrument case,D: music shop,E: music store, Knowledge: The question implies that the mandolin needs to be stored somewhere when not in use. Among the options provided, closet is unlikely to be the correct answer since it does not provide proper protection for the instrument. Musical instrument store, music shop, and music store are not suitable answers as they are places where instruments are sold, not stored. The most logical answer is instrument case, as it is designed specifically for the purpose of storing and protecting musical instruments. Answer is
--target-- instrument case
--input-- Question: How do the bosses share knowledge in person at work? Options: A: meeting,B: dinner,C: encyclopedia,D: class,E: university,  Answer is

Options: A: movie theater,B: stadium,C: church,D: show,E: arena, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the audience is likely watching a sports game or activity where a ball is being used. This type of event usually takes place in a stadium, where there is a large open space for players to move around and spectators to watch from various angles. The other options do not typically have events that involve a ball being thrown or hit. Answer is
--target-- stadium
--input-- Question: If children are happy, what do they do? Options: A: enjoyed,B: skip,C: sleep,D: awesome,E: watch television, Knowledge: The sentence implies that when children are happy, they engage in some kind of physical activity that indicates their joy, as opposed to passive activities like watching TV or sleeping. Skipping is a form of physical expression that is often associated with happiness and carefree behavior in children, hence it is the most appropriate option among the given choices. 'Enjoyed' is a past participle and cannot be used to describe actions in the present tense. 'Sleep' and 'watch television' are not indicative of children's happiness in this context, and 'awesome' is an adjective that does not describe an action. Answer is
--target-- skip
--input-- Question: If a phoneless person needs to make a call from a public phone, where might they find one? Options: A: office,B: desktop,C: neighbor's house,D: movie theater,E: rest area, Knowledge: Public phones are typically found in places where people may need to make calls but do not have access to a personal phone, such as rest areas along highways. The other options do not typically have public phones available, and it would be unusual to find a public phone in an office or someone's house. Answer is
--target-- rest area
--input-- Question: A quarter of it was twenty five pounds, so the whole was what? Options: A: school year,B: hundredweight,C: upper,D: century,E: hour, Knowledge: A "quarter" typically refers to 25% of something, and in this sentence, it is specified that the quarter in question has a weight of 25 pounds. This suggests that the item being weighed is likely measured in pounds or something similar, which rules out choices like "school year," "upper," and "century." "Hour" is also not a likely answer, as it is a unit of time rather than weight. "Hundredweight," on the other hand, is a unit of weight that equals 100 pounds, and therefore fits with the information provided in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- hundredweight
--input-- Question: John didn't have to ride his bike.  He did it for only one reason. What reason is that? Options: A: thirst,B: enjoyment,C: for fun,D: pleasure,E: fatigue, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John did not have to ride his bike, but he still did it for a reason. The reason is likely to be something that is enjoyable or pleasurable to him, since he was not doing it out of necessity such as thirst or fatigue. The options "for fun" and "pleasure" are synonymous with enjoyment and fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- enjoyment
--input-- Question: The play was nearly starting, everybody took their seat in the what? Options: A: show,B: in cinema,C: theatre,D: bench,E: martorell, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the play was about to start, which is a clear indication that the setting is a theatrical performance. The choice "theatre" refers to a venue specifically designed for stage performances, which would be the most likely location for the play to take place. The other options, such as "show" or "in cinema," are too vague to accurately describe the setting implied by the sentence. "Bench" and "Martorell" are unlikely options as they don't directly relate to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- theatre
--input-- Question: Where does a cast act? Options: A: perform,B: stage,C: cast net,D: film,E: broken leg, Knowledge: In the context of theater or acting, a cast typically refers to the group of actors who perform on stage. The word "perform" is also commonly associated with acting and theater, further supporting the idea that the correct answer is "stage." The other options, such as "cast net" and "broken leg," are unrelated to acting or theater. "Film" might also be a valid answer, but it is less specific than "stage" and could refer to acting in movies or television shows as well. Answer is
--target-- stage
--input-- Question: Dancing poorly in public may make you feel what? Options: A: exhaustion,B: recognizance,C: blisters,D: humiliation,E: fatigue, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that dancing poorly in public can lead to a negative emotional experience. The word "humiliation" specifically denotes a feeling of shame or embarrassment, which would be appropriate in this context. The other options don't necessarily convey a negative emotional experience related to dancing poorly, such as exhaustion or fatigue (which are physical sensations) and blisters or recognizance (which don't necessarily indicate a negative emotional experience). Answer is
--target-- humiliation
--input-- Question: What is the object with a point used for mountain climbing? Options: A: hat,B: arrowhead,C: needle,D: alpenstock,E: waterpoint, Knowledge: The sentence describes an object with a point that is used for mountain climbing. This eliminates choices such as hat, arrowhead, and needle, which are not associated with mountain climbing equipment. Waterpoint is also unlikely, as it does not have a point and is not used for climbing. Alpenstock, on the other hand, is a type of pole or stick used specifically for mountain climbing and is known for its pointed tip. Answer is
--target-- alpenstock
--input-- Question: THe apiarist bought a new queen, where was the queen bound? Options: A: england,B: beehive,C: farmyard,D: monarchy,E: deck of cards, Knowledge: Apiarists are beekeepers, and the term "queen" refers to the female bee responsible for laying eggs and leading the hive. To introduce a new queen to a hive, the apiarist typically cages her or binds her wings to prevent her from leaving. The logical answer to the question, therefore, is "beehive." The other options, such as "England," "monarchy," or "deck of cards," have no apparent connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- beehive
--input-- Question: Where are there more than 1 trillion planets like earth? Options: A: god's creation,B: ball stopped,C: gravity,D: milky way,E: universe, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are more than 1 trillion planets that are similar to Earth. This is a statistical estimate that is difficult to confirm, but it suggests that the number of planets like Earth is very large. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. "God's creation" is a religious concept and not a scientific explanation for the existence of planets. "Ball stopped" and "gravity" are physical concepts that do not relate to the number of planets in the universe. The Milky Way is a galaxy, but the sentence suggests that there are more than 1 trillion planets like Earth in the entire universe, not just one galaxy. Answer is
--target-- universe
--input-- Question: John and George are camping together.  They're sitting around a pile of sticks and john is lighting a match.  Why is john lighting a match? Options: A: illumination,B: set on fire,C: make fire,D: making flame,E: frustration, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John is attempting to start a fire, which is commonly done by using a match or other ignition source. The other options do not fit the context as there is no indication that John is frustrated, trying to illuminate anything, or trying to intentionally set something on fire. Answer is
--target-- make fire
--input-- Question: The monkey was hopping around, climbing things, and swinging around his habitat.  What might he have been feeling? Options: A: treetops,B: playful mood,C: brazil,D: rain forest,E: busy, Knowledge: The behavior described in the sentence is typical of a monkey who is feeling playful and energetic. Monkeys are known for climbing, jumping, and swinging, especially within their habitat. The other options do not provide any clues as to the monkey's behavior or emotions. Brazil and the rain forest are locations that monkeys are found, but they do not necessarily tell us about the specific behavior of the monkey in the sentence. Treetops and busy are also not directly related to the monkey's behavior or emotions. Answer is
--target-- playful mood
--input-- Question: What is likely to be a child's reaction to going to play? Options: A: happiness,B: tears,C: sit,D: being entertained,E: laugh, Knowledge: Going to play is typically seen as a fun and enjoyable activity for children, which would lead to a positive emotional response such as happiness. Tears and sitting would suggest negative or indifferent emotions, while being entertained and laughter are more general emotions that can apply to a variety of situations and do not necessarily indicate a specific reaction to going to play. Answer is
--target-- happiness
--input-- Question: LEds  are commonly found on kehyboards and other what? Options: A: television,B: electronic devices,C: pc board,D: electrical machine,E: dashboard, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that LEDs (light emitting diodes) are commonly found on keyboards and other items, indicating that they are typically used in electronic devices.

The chemistry lab is not a place to buy food or alcohol, and restaurants and pubs may sell alcohol but may not have a wide selection of nourishing items for purchase. Answer is
--target-- supermarket
--input-- Question: Where is a flat likely to be grouped with other flats? Options: A: london,B: city,C: town,D: apartment building,E: condominium, Knowledge: Flats are typically found in larger structures like apartment buildings, whereas options like London, City, and Town are too broad and do not appropriately capture the context of the question. Condominiums can also refer to individual units like flats, but they are not always grouped together in a larger building as frequently as flats are. Answer is
--target-- apartment building
--input-- Question: I only like fiction books, why should I read a non-fiction book? Options: A: knowledge,B: been printed new,C: many words,D: for fun,E: cover, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person only enjoys reading fiction books, but there may be a benefit to reading a non-fiction book. The answer "knowledge" is the most logical choice, as non-fiction books are often written to teach readers about a particular subject or provide information about real events. By reading a non-fiction book, the person could expand their knowledge and learn something new. The other options (been printed new, many words, for fun, cover) do not provide a compelling reason to read a non-fiction book. Answer is
--target-- knowledge
--input-- Question: Where would you be most likely to see a cow? Options: A: road,B: slaughter house,C: ranch,D: switzerland,E: tennessee, Knowledge: Cows are typically raised on farms or ranches for their milk, meat, or as draft animals. Therefore, the correct answer would be "ranch."

Answer is
--target-- ranch

Options: A: misrepresent,B: cover up,C: offer price,D: deceive,E: leave town, Knowledge: A real estate agent's primary job is to help their customers find a suitable property within their budget. Offering a price is a common action that a real estate agent could take in order to negotiate a deal with the seller of a house. Misrepresenting, covering up, deceiving, or leaving town are all unethical or illegal actions that a real estate agent should not engage in. These options do not align with the responsibilities of a real estate agent. Answer is
--target-- offer price
--input-- Question: What is someone looking for in a new mattress when returning one that had lots of rigidity? Options: A: ductility,B: empity,C: softness,D: flexibility,E: malleability, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person did not like the previous mattress because it was too rigid or hard, so they are likely seeking a mattress that is softer and more comfortable. Out of the choices given, ductility, malleability, and flexibility all refer to a object's ability to bend or change shape, which is not directly related to comfort. Empity is not a word, and therefore cannot be the answer. Answer is
--target-- softness

Options: A: reproduction,B: junior,C: copy,D: derivative,E: remake, Knowledge: The question refers to creating a new version of an existing movie, which is commonly known as a remake. The term reproduction refers to creating a copy of an original artwork or document, and may not fit the context of the question. Junior is not commonly used in this context. Copy and derivative could apply to many types of media, not only movies, and may not provide enough specificity to answer the question accurately. Answer is
--target-- remake
--input-- Question: An over-heated snake will hide where in a house? Options: A: bedroom,B: tropical forest,C: oklahoma,D: basement,E: river, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that an over-heated snake will seek shelter in a house, and the correct answer is likely a location in a house that is cooler than other areas.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- basement

Options: A: workplace,B: gravesite,C: shelter,D: interesting place,E: temperate climate, Knowledge: The question asks for the easiest place to live, which suggests a place that provides ideal conditions for survival. A temperate climate is typically characterized by moderate temperatures, with neither extreme heat nor extreme cold, which can be ideal for humans and many other animals to live in.

--target-- temperate climate
--input-- Question: There is a hard substance that must take on different forms, what are these forms? Options: A: ice cream ,B: chipped,C: formed into cubes,D: antarctica,E: found in artic, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a hard substance can take on different forms, which implies that it is something that can be manipulated or molded in different ways. The option "formed into cubes" best fits this description, as it suggests a solid substance that can be shaped into different forms.

Answer is
--target-- formed into cubes

Options: A: pot,B: garden center,C: front lawn,D: formal garden,E: backyard, Knowledge: The question asks for a location to put a rosebush if the person does not want to keep it outside, implying that the rosebush needs to be kept indoors.

Options: A: hockey game,B: home,C: hospital,D: emergency room,E: doctor's office, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person sustained a significant injury that requires medical attention. While a doctor's office or an emergency room could also be options for medical care, the mention of a "bad" injury implies that the person may need more extensive treatment than a doctor's office could provide.

Options: A: with others,B: with people,C: crowded,D: together,E: contact, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when two people who love each other are alone, they will want to be in each other's company and not be with other people or in a crowded setting.

Options: A: clean bathroom,B: cleaning house,C: an affair,D: clean room,E: clean house, Knowledge: The word "maid" typically refers to someone who is hired to clean and maintain a house, so the end result of hiring a maid is likely to have a clean house.

Options: A: contemplate,B: win,C: gain,D: money,E: profit, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject has experienced a loss and is looking for something to help them feel better. "Win" is the most likely answer as it is the opposite of "loss" and could bring a sense of victory or accomplishment. "Contemplate" and "gain" may be too abstract or unrelated to the context. "Money" and "profit" may have a positive connotation, but they do not necessarily suggest a solution to the problem at hand. Answer is

Options: A: battle field,B: air,C: gun,D: weapon,E: baseball, Knowledge: A projectile is an object that is launched into the air and travels through it until it hits a target. In this question, the options "battlefield," "gun," and "weapon" suggest a context of warfare where projectiles might be used, but none of them correctly answer the question as they do not describe what the projectile passes through. "Baseball" is also unrelated to the question. The correct answer is "air" because it is the medium through which a projectile travels. Answer is

Options: A: sleeping,B: momentum,C: stress,D: excitement,E: working, Knowledge: The question is asking what beginning work is likely to lead to, which implies that the answer should be related to work or the workday. While options like sleeping and excitement may be things we experience before or after work, they do not directly answer the question of what beginning work is likely to lead to.

Therefore, the most logical answer is "working," as beginning work is likely to lead to a day of work. The option "stress" could also be a possibility, but it would depend on the context and personal experience of the individual. Answer is

The other options (church basement, wedding party) do not have any clear connection to waiting for food. The misspelling of "restaurant" as "restorand" is irrelevant to the context of the sentence.

Hamburger is a relatively high protein food, so this aligns with the sentence. "Crack" and "cook one" are not related to the context of the sentence and "good to eat" and "satisfy hunger" are too general and do not provide a clear answer. Answer is
--target-- protein

Options: A: winch,B: factory,C: roller coaster,D: ship,E: building, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the steel cable has not been completed yet, which means it is in the process of being manufactured. A factory is the most likely place to find a steel cable that has not been completed yet because it is where steel cables are typically produced.

Options: A: there,B: nearby,C: far,D: in sight,E: being here, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being referred to has moved to a different state, which implies a significant physical distance from the speaker. "Far" is the most appropriate word to describe this type of distance. "There" refers to the location where the person has moved and does not inherently imply a specific distance. "Nearby" implies close proximity, which contradicts the idea of the person being far away. "In sight" and "being here" imply that the person is still nearby and visible, which again contradicts the idea of them being far away. Answer is

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- opera house

Options: A: smelling,B: hearing,C: seeing,D: sight,E: sniff, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a song has the ability to emotionally affect the listener, and this effect is achieved through one of the five senses. The phrase "touch your heart" implies that the effect is emotional, rather than physical. The options "smelling" and "sniff" are related to the sense of smell, which is not commonly associated with music. "Seeing" and "sight" refer to the sense of sight, which is not directly related to the experience of listening to music. Therefore, "hearing" is the most appropriate answer, as it is the sense directly related to the experience of listening to music. Answer is
--target-- hearing

Options: A: discomfort,B: anxiety,C: solitude,D: falling asleep,E: play games, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was sitting quietly and not doing something easily because the speaker was having trouble with something. The options discomfort, anxiety, and solitude may suggest that James was either feeling uncomfortable, worried, or alone. However, the option of falling asleep does not fit with the context of the sentence as it suggests that James was feeling tired and sleepy, which is not relevant to the situation described. The option of playing games also does not fit with the context as it is not mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is he was not falling asleep easily. Answer is

Options: A: conclave,B: playground,C: stadium,D: mortuary,E: school, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the place being described is one that contains dead bodies, which is typical of a mortuary. The use of the word "morbid" reinforces this idea, as mortuaries deal with death and are often associated with negativity. The phrase "something very human" suggests that there is an emotional component to the place, which could be related to the grieving process or the solemnity of the situation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- mortuary

The options of deceive, manipulate, and lie, all suggest unethical behavior, which would not be a desirable trait in someone in real estate.

Answer is

Options: A: collaboration,B: make person sick,C: progress,D: static,E: transfer of information, Knowledge: The word "static" typically refers to interference or noise in the communication channel that can disrupt or distort the transmission of information.

The word "celebrate" is the most appropriate choice as it aligns with the idea of getting together to acknowledge and enjoy the accomplishment. The other options, such as "pride" and "gratification," suggest a more personal feeling of satisfaction rather than a communal celebration.

In this context, "ship goods" is the most logical choice because it implies that the company is responsible for transporting the products to their customers. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they have no clear connection to the sale of products.

"Competitiveness," "losing," and "winning" are less likely because they are not qualities that typically require intentional practice or instruction.

The options "wedding," "fraternity house," and "movie" do not fit the context of two friends communicating from different countries. "Smoke signals" are not a practical or reliable communication method in modern times. Therefore, "internet cafe" is the most logical option as it is a place where one can use the internet to communicate with people remotely. Answer is
--target-- internet cafe
--input-- Question: If you see a fox in Fargo, what state are you in? Options: A: west virginia,B: arkansas,C: new hampshire,D: north dakota,E: england, Knowledge: The question specifically mentions seeing a fox in Fargo, which is a city located in North Dakota.

--input-- Question: When doing housework, what would be most useful to clean the patio? Options: A: mop,B: mobility,C: vacuuming,D: toothbrush,E: broom, Knowledge: A patio is typically an outdoor space that is made of hard, durable materials such as concrete or stone. It is likely that the surface of a patio would be best cleaned by sweeping away dirt and debris with a broom, rather than using a mop or toothbrush, which would be better suited for cleaning a softer or more delicate surface. Vacuuming may also be effective, but it may not be as efficient as sweeping, particularly if the surface is rough or uneven. Mobility is unrelated to cleaning the patio. Answer is
--target-- broom
--input-- Question: how might someone get injured when driving a car? Options: A: getting somewhere,B: go somewhere,C: stoplight,D: car crash,E: pollution, Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a potential danger when driving a car, and one of the most common and serious risks is a car crash. This is an accident that can result in various injuries, such as whiplash, broken bones, or even fatalities. The other options do not relate to the physical danger of driving a car, but rather the purpose or environmental impact. Answer is
--target-- car crash
--input-- Question: Where are fish from salt water happiest? Options: A: river,B: boat,C: aquarium,D: brackish,E: ocean, Knowledge: Fish from saltwater are adapted to living in an environment with high salt levels, which is characteristic of the ocean. Rivers and brackish water have lower salt content and would not be ideal habitats for saltwater fish. Boats and aquariums are man-made environments and the happiness of a fish in these settings depends on factors other than salt content. Answer is
--target-- ocean
--input-- Question: The doctor noticed the nerve and suggested a scan of everything, what would be scanned? Options: A: brainstem,B: skeleton,C: organism,D: animal,E: human body, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the doctor noticed a nerve in a patient and recommended a scan of something related to the patient. The most likely option is the human body since it is the most relevant in a medical context. The brainstem is a part of the nervous system that is located in the brain, but the context suggests that the scan is more comprehensive. The skeleton is a part of the human body, but it is not a primary focus for a nerve-related scan. Organism and animal are very broad terms that do not provide any specific information related to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- human body
--input-- Question: What areas does a cat tend to seek out? Options: A: the place i don't want it,B: relaxed position,C: soft place,D: barn,E: urban settlement, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat is looking for a particular type of location. Cats are known for seeking out soft, comfortable places to rest, which is likely why "soft place" is a viable option in the choices. "The place I don't want it" and "barn" are unlikely options because they suggest locations that may not be conducive to a cat's comfort or safety. "Relaxed position" is a trait or behavior, not a location. "Urban settlement" is too general and does not provide any useful information about where a cat may seek out. Answer is
--target-- soft place
--input-- Question: Something that people do when they are sneezing a lot and have a runny nose? Options: A: inhale,B: blow nose,C: close eyes,D: cover face,E: spray, Knowledge: When someone is sneezing a lot and has a runny nose, they are likely dealing with a cold or allergy symptoms. Blowing one's nose is a common action people take to clear out excess mucus and relieve congestion during these times. While inhaling and covering the face are also actions people may take when sneezing, they do not directly address the issue of a runny nose. Closing one's eyes is simply a reflexive response to the forceful expulsion of air during a sneeze. Spray could refer to a nasal spray, but this choice is less commonly associated with the act of sneezing and having a runny nose. Answer is
--target-- blow nose
--input-- Question: Where are not many people allowed to go? Options: A: street corner,B: supermarket,C: space shuttle,D: an airport,E: public place, Knowledge: The phrase "not many people allowed to go" suggests a limited access area. Among the choices, only the space shuttle is limited in terms of the number of people who can actually go on board. The other choices, such as a street corner, supermarket or public place, do not have any clear restriction in terms of the number of people who are allowed to go. An airport may have security restrictions, but the number of people who can go is not strictly limited. Answer is
--target-- space shuttle
--input-- Question: What is a facial sign of having fun? Options: A: laughter,B: pleasure,C: smiling,D: being happy,E: showing teeth, Knowledge: Smiling is a common facial sign of having fun, as it is a natural response to feeling happy or enjoying oneself. While laughter and pleasure can also indicate fun, they may not always manifest in a visible facial expression. Being happy is a more general emotion and does not necessarily indicate specifically having fun. Showing teeth could be a sign of aggression or a forced smile, and may not necessarily indicate having fun either. Answer is
--target-- smiling
--input-- Question: She was a human in America who wanted to live well, what was a given for her situation? Options: A: think critically,B: need money,C: say hello,D: think critically,E: drink tea, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being described is living in America and desires a comfortable life, which would indicate that having sufficient financial resources is a necessity for her situation. The phrase "wanting to live well" implies a standard of living that most likely requires a certain level of income. The other options, such as saying hello or drinking tea, do not relate to the context of the sentence and therefore cannot be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- need money
--input-- Question: Where does a potato enlarge? Options: A: garden patch,B: ireland,C: vegetable stew,D: grocery store,E: optical device, Knowledge: Potatoes grow in the ground, so it would make sense that they would enlarge in a garden patch or other similar outdoor growing environment. Ireland may be known for its potatoes, but it is not where a potato physically enlarges. Vegetable stew and grocery store are not places where a potato would enlarge. An optical device is not relevant to the growth of a potato. Answer is
--target-- garden patch

Options: A: eat cake,B: end badly,C: communicating moral,D: near end,E: floor, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Simon's book is missing and that his father is looking for it.

Options: A: insubstantial,B: mind,C: intangible,D: ethereal,E: spiritual, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hippy girl helped him experience something beyond the physical realm. The words "tangible" and "corporeal" indicate that he had only experienced things that could be touched or felt, while the other choices suggest non-physical or abstract concepts. "Spiritual" is the best choice because it refers to matters related to the soul, faith, or higher power. The other options, such as "insubstantial" or "ethereal," do not necessarily connote a spiritual awakening. Answer is
--target-- spiritual
--input-- Question: A person who is well off has the simplest of luxuries that they can just do what? Options: A: perfect world,B: be a snob,C: headache,D: eat well,E: live comfortably, Knowledge: The phrase "well off" typically refers to someone who is financially affluent and able to afford a comfortable lifestyle.

Options: A: an infestation,B: civilisation,C: homes,D: graveyard,E: spacecraft, Knowledge: An infestation is a term used for a large number of pests or insects that cause harm, while homes are individual dwellings and a graveyard is a place where dead people are buried. A spacecraft is a vehicle designed to travel in space. Civilization is a term used to describe a human society that has developed to a level of complexity with a large population, infrastructure, and culture. Therefore, civilization is the correct answer as it refers to a large group of human beings. Answer is

--input-- Question: Where would you buy a disk with software on it? Options: A: computer hard drive,B: computer to store data,C: cd player,D: computer store,E: electronic department, Knowledge: A disk with software on it is typically called a "software installation disk" or a "software CD." These types of disks are sold in computer stores where consumers can purchase new software or updates to existing programs. Computer hard drives are used to store data, but they do not typically come with pre-loaded software. CD players are used for playing music or other media, but they are not used for installing software. The electronic department may include computer stores, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer. Answer is

--input-- Question: Polly didn't know her way around, so she navigated by landmark.  She used statues, stores, and distinctive building.  Where might she be? Options: A: countryside,B: national park,C: map,D: neighbourhood,E: city, Knowledge: The use of landmarks for navigation is a common practice in urban areas with a lot of distinctive buildings, statues, and stores. The other options such as the countryside, national park, and map, do not suggest the presence of recognizable landmarks in the same way that a city would. A neighborhood might also have landmarks, but it would not likely be as useful for navigating if one is not familiar with the area. Answer is
--target-- city
--input-- Question: If I am playing a xylophone with a large, professional ensemble, what am I a member of? Options: A: museum,B: abc book,C: planet,D: orchestra,E: high school band, Knowledge: The term "large, professional ensemble" suggests that the context is related to music performance. The term "xylophone" also suggests that the musical instrument is being played. The term "orchestra" refers to a large group of musicians playing various instruments, including the xylophone. The other choices, such as museum, abc book, planet, and high school band, do not have any connection to the context of music performance or playing a xylophone. Answer is
--target-- orchestra
--input-- Question: Where could you see a sloth that is not real? Options: A: bad dream,B: picture book,C: another place,D: universe,E: zoo, Knowledge: The question is asking where you can see a fake or not real sloth. A picture book is a common place to see illustrations of animals, including ones that are not real. A bad dream and the universe are not typical places to see illustrations of animals, and "another place" is too vague to be a correct answer. While a zoo might seem like a possible answer, the question specifies that the sloth is not real, meaning it's not an actual animal on display at a zoo. Answer is
--target-- picture book

Options: A: revelations,B: frustation,C: new insights,D: hesitation,E: enlightenment, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is considering or exploring different opinions, which implies a desire to gain something. The options "revelations", "frustration", and "hesitation" do not necessarily imply a positive outcome, while "enlightenment" implies a more profound or spiritual experience than what is suggested in the sentence. "New insights" is the most fitting choice as considering different opinions is often done to gain a deeper understanding or new perspectives on a topic. Answer is
--target-- new insights
--input-- Question: What is someone likely to feel after the act of procreating? Options: A: exhaustion,B: feeling good,C: having children,D: overpopulation,E: hair loss, Knowledge: The act of procreating typically refers to sexual intercourse with the intent to have children.

--target-- feeling good
--input-- Question: Where might you find dirt on a place you would see a gutter and rubber hit it regularly? Options: A: race track,B: bed,C: ground,D: street,E: subway, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where gutters and rubber hit the ground regularly, which is typically seen on a street. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A race track may have gutters, but rubber hitting it regularly is not a typical occurrence. Dirt on a bed or subway would be unlikely, and while dirt could be found on the ground, this option does not account for the presence of gutters and rubber. Answer is
--target-- street
--input-- Question: What happens to the person that is well known for frequent farting? Options: A: social ostracism,B: evil,C: loud noise,D: bad smell,E: stinking, Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is well-known for frequent farting, which may be seen as socially unacceptable behavior. The consequence of this behavior may be social ostracism, where the person is excluded from social activities or events due to their behavior. The other options, such as evil or loud noise, do not directly relate to the context of the question. The options bad smell and stinking are relevant, but they are both consequences of the behavior rather than the actual consequence the question is asking about. Answer is
--target-- social ostracism
--input-- Question: Sam thought that it was beautiful outside, even though it was what? Options: A: rainy,B: repulsive,C: unbeautiful,D: horrible,E: bad, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam found the outside to be beautiful despite a particular weather condition.

--target-- rainy
--input-- Question: He was learning about the use of color and all their tints, and even how to use what technique? Options: A: black white,B: old timey,C: white black,D: dark,E: monochromatic, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is studying the use of color and its various shades, which is a characteristic commonly associated with the use of monochromatic colors. Monochromatic color schemes use variations of a single hue, often adding shades of white or black to create a range of tints. Therefore, the technique being referred to in the sentence is likely the use of monochromatic color. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- monochromatic
--input-- Question: Where do airplanes usually go?

Options: A: greenhouse,B: surface of earth,C: television,D: windowsill,E: garden, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that plants are covering something, which is most commonly associated with the surface of the earth.

A television and windowsill also do not have any connection to the context. A garden may have plants, but it is not mentioned specifically in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- surface of earth
--input-- Question: What can someone do after going to bed? Options: A: pregnancy,B: drowsiness,C: insomnia,D: make a sandwich,E: sleeping in, Knowledge: The question is asking for an action someone can do after going to bed, which implies that they are already asleep. Therefore, the correct answer would not be an action that is typically taken before going to bed (such as making a sandwich) or a medical condition (such as pregnancy or insomnia). "Sleeping in" is a common phrase used to describe the act of continuing to sleep past one's usual wake-up time. "Drowsiness" is not an action, but a state of being that someone may feel before falling asleep. Answer is
--target-- sleeping in
--input-- Question: What is a health benefit of jumping rope? Options: A: increased heart rate,B: get weight,C: having fun,D: sweating,E: hopping, Knowledge: Jumping rope is a cardiovascular exercise that increases the heart rate, which is beneficial for overall heart health. Getting weight is not a health benefit and can be a negative consequence if it leads to overweight or obesity.

Hopping is a synonym for jumping and does not provide any information about the health benefits of jumping rope. Answer is
--target-- increased heart rate

Options: A: painting,B: england,C: wooded areas,D: ask them first,E: chicken coop, Knowledge: The question is asking how an artist would create a fox, which suggests that the answer should relate to the process of making art. Painting is a common medium for creating animal portraits, including foxes, so it is the most likely answer.

"Ask them first" and "chicken coop" are irrelevant and do not make sense as answers. Answer is
--target-- painting

Options: A: foot,B: sandal,C: loaf of bread,D: shoe,E: boot, Knowledge: The word "heel" typically refers to the back end of something that is curved or angled, like the heel of your foot or the heel of a shoe. In the context of food, a "loaf of bread" is the option that makes the most sense as it has a curved back end that is sometimes referred to as the "heel" of the loaf. The other options, such as "foot" or "sandal," do not have any clear connections to food, and "shoe" and "boot" do not have any curved or angled ends that could be called a "heel." Answer is
--target-- loaf of bread

Options: A: canada,B: spring,C: active,D: outside,E: washington state, Knowledge: The question asks about the location of a person when they see an apple tree.

--target-- car dealership

Options: A: zoo,B: cafe,C: park,D: outside,E: woodland, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location where Bill saw the wild animal was unexpected. Out of the given options, a cafe would be the most unexpected place to encounter a wild animal. The other options, such as a zoo or park, are more likely places where one might see wild animals. The option "outside" is too general and does not provide enough context to make a guess. Woodland could be an unexpected place to see a wild animal, but the sentence suggests that it was a specific location where Bill did not expect to see a wild animal. Answer is
--target-- cafe
--input-- Question: The plates needed to be stored in their proper place, which was where?

Answer is
--target-- shelf
--input-- Question: Where do nurses work with one doctor? Options: A: resuscitate,B: doctor's office,C: hospital,D: reception,E: nursing home, Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about a situation where one nurse works alongside one doctor. Out of the choices given, a doctor's office is the most likely setting where this would occur.

Answer is
--target-- doctor's office

Options: A: mailcatcher,B: post office,C: usps,D: neighbor's house,E: table, Knowledge: The sentence states that the mail scattered in the wind, which implies that it was blown away from the mailbox. The most likely place it would land in this scenario is the nearest object that could stop or redirect its path, which in this case could be the neighbor's house. The other options, such as a mailcatcher or post office, do not make sense in this context as they are not related to the scenario of scattered mail due to wind. Answer is
--target-- neighbor's house

Options: A: continue to grow,B: turn brown,C: changes color with seasons,D: dry,E: burn, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the grass did not receive any sunlight because of the car parked over it, which is likely to result in the grass being deprived of essential nutrients, leading to its death. This is a common phenomenon observed in lawns and gardens when sunlight is restricted. Turning brown is a common sign of grass dying due to lack of sunlight. The other options do not seem to be logical consequences of a lack of sunlight, except for 'dry,' which could also potentially happen. Answer is
--target-- turn brown

Options: A: garbage can,B: garbage dump,C: sewer,D: street,E: gutter, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the city needed a way to handle garbage waste, which implies a larger-scale solution than individual garbage cans or sewers. The options "street" and "gutter" are not appropriate solutions for managing garbage waste, and while garbage cans are a more localized solution, they would not be sufficient for managing the waste of an entire city. A garbage dump, on the other hand, is a common solution for managing large amounts of garbage waste, which makes it the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- garbage dump

In this setting, it is likely that there will be flowers around, making it a natural choice for the child to gather. The other options, such as cleaning a room or setting a table, are not appropriate activities to be doing in a meadow. Additionally, the phrase "play with toys" is too general and does not provide any context-specific clues. "Forming opinions" is also not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- gather flowers

--input-- Question: Where is a good place to set an attache case other than a desk? Options: A: business meeting,B: hospital,C: lawyer's office,D: chair,E: professional, Knowledge: The question is asking where it is appropriate to place an attache case, which suggests that the answer should be a location where someone might need to temporarily place and store their attache case. The options "business meeting," "hospital," and "lawyer's office" are all locations where people may need to bring an attache case, but it is not clear where in those locations it would be appropriate to place it. "Chair" is the best answer because it is a piece of furniture that someone can place an attache case on while still keeping it within reach, and "professional" is not a location, but rather a general descriptor that does not help answer the question. Answer is

The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is

Options: A: sore feet,B: death,C: twenty six,D: feel tired,E: short breath, Knowledge: Running a marathon (26 miles) is a physically demanding activity that can cause fatigue and exhaustion. The phrase "what does someone feel" indicates that the question is asking about a subjective experience. While sore feet may be a common consequence of running a marathon, it is not necessarily the primary feeling one would have. Death is obviously not a common outcome of running a marathon. "Twenty six" is not a feeling, it is simply the distance of the marathon. Short breath may be experienced during the run, but the question is asking about the post-run feeling. Answer is
--target-- feel tired

Options: A: kitchen,B: doctor's office,C: hospital,D: bathroom,E: jar, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people tend to keep their medicine in a specific location, and the most logical option would be the bathroom because it is a private and easily accessible space. Additionally, many medications need to be taken with water or other liquids, which are typically found in a bathroom. While medicines can also be found in a kitchen or stored in a jar, these options are less likely given the context of the sentence. A doctor's office or hospital would not be locations where people would typically keep their medicine. Answer is

Options: A: refrigerator,B: ocean,C: pay debts,D: stream,E: market, Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the question is asking about a place where fish are sold.

These roles are typically found in a rock band, which often includes these instruments. The other options, such as string quartet or music store, do not fit the description given in the sentence.

This means that their demands, which caused the strike in the first place, must have been met by the management. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. If the company had closed, the union workers would not have gone off strike. If the management had given more money, the union workers would have been happy and not gone on strike in the first place.

Options: A: closed container,B: art room,C: sticky,D: desk drawer,E: cabinet, Knowledge: The question is asking where glue will stay usable, which implies that there are certain conditions that will keep the glue in good condition. The correct answer is "closed container" because once opened, glue can dry out or harden if left exposed to air. This is why it's important to keep glue tightly sealed when not in use. The other options, such as "art room" or "desk drawer," don't necessarily provide the necessary conditions for preserving the glue's usability. "Sticky" is not a location and "cabinet" gives no indication of whether the container is open or closed, so these options can be eliminated. Answer is

--target-- friendly

Options: A: car show,B: home,C: truck,D: airport,E: repair shop, Knowledge: The sentence implies that John was putting in extra effort to make his vehicle look its best, which suggests that he was preparing it for public display. Additionally, the option "car show" specifically mentions an event where people showcase their cars, which fits with the context of the sentence.

Options: A: watch film,B: see favorite show,C: play chess,D: surf net,E: play cards, Knowledge: The context suggests that the entertainment option should not require electricity, which rules out watching a film or seeing a favorite show.

These individuals are often referred to as "important" people, and their stories are considered worth telling. While it is possible for a book to be written about someone who is entertaining or engaging, these characteristics alone are not typically enough to warrant an entire book.

--input-- Question: Where can a person buy a snake? Options: A: tropical forest,B: walmart,C: north america,D: feild,E: pet shops, Knowledge: While snakes can be found in tropical forests and fields, these are not locations where one typically buys a pet snake.

--input-- Question: I need to store my honey, where should it go? Options: A: stick to fingers,B: jar,C: farmer's market,D: beehive,E: house, Knowledge: Since honey is a liquid, the most practical option for storing it would be in a jar with a lid. This will prevent the honey from spilling or attracting pests like ants. The other options do not make sense in the context of storing honey. "Stick to fingers" is not a storage option but rather a result of handling honey. "Farmer's market" refers to a place where goods are sold but not stored. "Beehive" is where bees produce honey rather than where it's stored. "House" is too broad and does not answer the question specifically. Answer is
--target-- jar

Options: A: able to hear,B: concentrate,C: pay attention,D: stop talking,E: eyes on her, Knowledge: When a teacher asks their students to "listen," it typically means that they want the students to focus and actively engage with what is being said. The other options may be related to listening, but they do not fully capture the meaning of actively engaging with someone speaking to you. For example, being able to hear simply means that sound reaches your ears, but it doesn't necessarily suggest active engagement with the speaker. Similarly, having your eyes on the teacher may show that you are physically present and looking in their direction, but it doesn't necessarily capture the idea of actively listening and engaging with them.

Options: A: generosity,B: spend money,C: earn money,D: have money,E: generous, Knowledge: The question is asking what is necessary in order to buy presents for others, which implies a need for a certain amount of money. The options "spend money" and "earn money" suggest actions that can lead to having money, but do not guarantee the presence of money. "Generosity" and "generous" suggest a willingness to give, but do not address the practical matter of having the means to give. Therefore, the correct answer is "have money" as it directly addresses the requirement for purchasing gifts. Answer is
--target-- have money
--input-- Question: What is important for a couple to do? Options: A: live together,B: row about,C: plan to marry,D: communicate,E: marry each other, Knowledge: The other options may be related to a couple's relationship, but the sentence specifically mentions something that is important for them to do.

Options: A: refigerator,B: screened porch,C: clay pot,D: shady places,E: arboretum, Knowledge: Ficus plants require well-draining soil and good air circulation around their roots. Clay pots are a popular choice for planting ficus because they allow excess moisture to evaporate and provide good air flow. Refrigerators and shady places would not be appropriate for a plant that needs sunlight to thrive. A screened porch or arboretum could be suitable locations for a ficus, but the question is specifically about the container needed, not the location of the plant. Answer is
--target-- clay pot

Options: A: glee,B: injuries,C: being happy,D: sandwiches,E: pleasure, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Bobby's action of jumping off the slide had negative consequences when he landed. The word "injuries" suggests physical harm or damage, which makes sense in the context of jumping off a playground slide. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and the words "glee" and "being happy" have a positive connotation that does not fit with the idea of Bobby's action having negative consequences. Answer is
--target-- injuries
--input-- Question: I was having a bath for 4 hours, what might I suffer from physiologically? Options: A: have fun,B: cold,C: get wet,D: being clean,E: wrinkled skin, Knowledge: When skin is exposed to water for prolonged periods of time, it can become wrinkled due to water absorption.

Sam did not like going to the concert hall because of the loud noise, which suggests that he may prefer a quieter setting for entertainment.

The word "exceptional" fits this context as it means unusually good, outstanding, or remarkable. The other options like "strange" or "unusual" have negative connotations and do not fit the context of the sentence.

Options: A: misfire,B: explode,C: jam,D: break,E: take life, Knowledge: When guns get wet, the water may cause the gunpowder to become damp and less effective, leading to misfires or failure to fire. Explosions are rare and usually only occur if the gun is severely damaged or if the ammunition has been tampered with. Jams can occur if debris or moisture gets into the gun's action, causing it to malfunction. Guns can break if they are not properly maintained, but it is not a common occurrence when they get wet.

Options: A: plenty,B: empty,C: abundant,D: plentiful,E: available, Knowledge: The phrase "out of stock" implies that the product was not available for purchase. Therefore, if the product has been restocked, it is now available once again. The other choices, such as "plenty," "empty," and "abundant," do not suggest that the product is available for purchase again. "Plentiful" and "plenty" suggest that there is a large amount of something, but not necessarily that it is available for purchase. "Empty" implies that there is nothing left or available, and "abundant" suggests that there is a lot of something, but not necessarily that it is available for purchase. Answer is
--target-- available

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- bridge

Options: A: surface of earth,B: library,C: potato,D: most buildings,E: desktop, Knowledge: The sentence contrasts Mars with something that has a variety of features, which suggests that the correct answer must also have a diverse range of components. The surface of Earth contains a variety of materials, such as soil, rocks, water, and vegetation, which makes it the most appropriate choice. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either do not have diverse features (e.g. potato and desktop), or are unrelated to the topic (e.g. library and most buildings). Answer is
--target-- surface of earth

--input-- Question: After chewing food and swallowing it during meals, what needs to happen for you to be able to successfully use the bathroom later? Options: A: good digestion,B: aid digestion,C: eating,D: sore mouth,E: toothache, Knowledge: Digestion is the process by which our body breaks down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed into our bloodstream and used for energy, growth, and repair. Good digestion is essential for the body to properly absorb nutrients and eliminate waste. Eating is the process of putting food in our mouth, and sore mouth and toothache are conditions that may affect the ability to chew and swallow food, but they do not affect the process of digestion itself. Aid digestion may refer to medications or supplements that assist the digestive process, but the sentence is not referring to these interventions. Answer is
--target-- good digestion

Options: A: throw away,B: disregard,C: being rude,D: humiliate,E: abhor, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Ben doesn't have much respect for Sue and would act in a way that is contrary to her wishes. "Disregard" means to ignore or pay no attention to, which fits the context of the sentence. "Throw away" and "humiliate" do not fit the context and seem too extreme. "Being rude" is not specific enough and could apply to a variety of actions. "Abhor" means to hate or detest, which doesn't make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- disregard

Options: A: appear,B: sound well,C: become broken,D: belong to person,E: gain speed, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person on the phone was sick and the speaker could no longer hear the sickness in their voice.

--target-- sound well
--input-- Question: Where should you keep a pet lizard? Options: A: desert,B: garden,C: galapagos archipelago,D: wild,E: glass cage, Knowledge: A pet lizard should be kept in a glass cage or tank, as it provides a secure and controlled environment that allows for temperature regulation and protection from predators.

Options: A: mainstream,B: conventional,C: straight,D: standard,E: ordinary, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy's characteristic of being "kooky" has no relation to his sexual orientation, specifically not being gay. The word "straight" is commonly used to refer to someone who is heterosexual, so it is the best option that accurately describes Billy's sexual orientation based on the given sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- straight
--input-- Question: When people are playing sports for to long what happens? Options: A: running,B: cheat,C: have fun,D: break out in purple polka dots,E: get tired, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence that occurs when people play sports for too long. Since the other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, we can eliminate them. Running and cheating are both actions that could potentially happen during sports, but they are not necessarily related to the negative consequence mentioned in the sentence. Having fun is generally considered a positive outcome of playing sports, so it is also not a likely answer. Finally, breaking out in purple polka dots is an absurd option that is clearly meant to be humorous, but it does not provide any useful information for choosing the correct answer. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is getting tired, which is a common consequence of physical activity. Answer is
--target-- get tired
--input-- Question: A monkey is native to what place that usually has no people? Options: A: research laboratory,B: south africa,C: rain forest,D: playful mood,E: canada, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the animal being referred to is a monkey and that it is native to a place without people. Given this information, it is most likely that the monkey is found in a natural habitat rather than a research laboratory. The options "south africa" and "Canada" are geographic locations, but they do not provide any information on where monkeys can be found. "Playful mood" is not a place, and is not relevant to the question. "Rain forest" is a type of natural habitat, which is commonly associated with primates such as monkeys. Therefore, "rain forest" is the most appropriate answer. Answer is
--target-- rain forest
--input-- Question: John didn't like getting in line.  He  had been working for a long time and was suffering from what?

Options: A: complete test,B: died,C: answer question,D: study book,E: read book, Knowledge: The act of raising one's hand in a classroom setting typically indicates the desire to answer a question or provide a comment. The other options, such as completing a test, reading a book, or studying a book, do not involve raising one's hand in the same way that answering a question does. "Died" is clearly not a valid option as no one would raise their hand in response to someone dying. Answer is
--target-- answer question

Options: A: produce sounds,B: roof,C: conference,D: desktop,E: concert, Knowledge: Computer speakers are typically kept on the desktop, which is the surface on which the computer monitor and other hardware sits.

Options: A: slow down,B: go fast,C: roll over,D: crash,E: fly, Knowledge: Stop signs are used to regulate traffic flow and require drivers to come to a complete stop before proceeding.

--input-- Question: where do some monkeys tend to live taht is hot? Options: A: rain forest,B: tree tops,C: treetops,D: great outdoors,E: tropical areas, Knowledge: The word "hot" suggests that the monkeys prefer a warm climate. "Tropical areas" are known for having warm and humid weather, making it a suitable habitat for many monkey species. "Rain forest" may also be a suitable habitat for monkeys, but the choice of the word "hot" makes "tropical areas" a more likely answer. "Tree tops" and "treetops" are not habitats themselves, but rather a location within a habitat, and "great outdoors" is too broad of a term. Answer is
--target-- tropical areas
--input-- Question: Other than school or from text where can one gain knowledge? Options: A: book,B: class,C: thinking,D: head,E: meeting, Knowledge: While books and classes are common sources of knowledge, the question asks for sources other than school or text. Meetings are a source of knowledge because they provide an opportunity for individuals to share their experiences and expertise with others. Meetings can also serve as a forum to discuss new ideas and learn from others. "Thinking" and "head" are not sources of knowledge, but rather describe a potential internal process. Answer is
--target-- meeting

Options: A: destroy enemy,B: wage war,C: fight enemy,D: have lunch,E: stab to death, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the soldiers are preparing to confront the invading soldiers with hostility, which is commonly associated with fighting.

--target-- fight enemy

Options: A: get angry,B: talk to each other,C: gather together,D: run a race,E: facing each other, Knowledge: The question is asking about a common activity that people in a family do during holidays. Gathering together is a common tradition among families during holidays, where they come together to celebrate and spend time with each other. Getting angry or facing each other do not necessarily relate to holiday traditions, while running a race is a specific activity that not all families may do. Talking to each other may occur during holiday gatherings, but it is not unique to holiday traditions. Answer is
--target-- gather together
--input-- Question: Reaching tentative agreement is the first result when two side make what to come closer together? Options: A: uncertainty,B: hug,C: compromises,D: fucking,E: calmness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when two sides work together to come closer, reaching a tentative agreement is the first result.

--target-- compromises

Options: A: room,B: hall,C: palace,D: spacecraft,E: villa, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cabin is larger than it appears at first glance and is actually made up of multiple rooms. The word "connected" also implies that there is some sort of passageway or hallway that links these rooms together. The word "bunkrooms" suggests that the cabin may be used for lodging or sleeping arrangements, further supporting the idea that it is made up of multiple smaller rooms. The other options, such as palace, spacecraft, and villa, do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be the correct answer. Answer is

Options: A: enemies,B: humiliation,C: aggression,D: defeat,E: stress, Knowledge: When people are competing, the main goal is usually to win. However, it is also possible to lose or be defeated. This outcome is often associated with feelings of disappointment, sadness, and frustration. The other options, such as enemies and humiliation, are not necessarily outcomes of competition in general and may not be directly related to the context of the sentence. Aggression and stress are potential effects of competition but are not necessarily outcomes in and of themselves. Answer is
--target-- defeat

Options: A: pool,B: reflecting pool,C: fish tank,D: ocean,E: sewage treatment plant, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that water is being used as a mirror, which is a design feature commonly associated with reflecting pools. Reflecting pools are often used in landscape architecture to create a calm and reflective surface that enhances the aesthetic and natural beauty of a surrounding area.

Options: A: chickens,B: slashes,C: great relief,D: beauty,E: new look, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Van Gogh was worried about something related to the appearance of his painting. The phrase "appeared different" implies that the painting did not look the way he wanted it to. The option "new look" best fits this context as it suggests a change in appearance. The other options, such as "chickens" and "slashes" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- new look

Options: A: atlantic ocean,B: fish market,C: sea of japan,D: water,E: rock band, Knowledge: The fugu blowfish is a type of fish that is generally found in the waters around Japan, particularly in the Sea of Japan. This fish is known for its toxic flesh, which can be deadly if not prepared properly, and is a delicacy in Japan.

--target-- sea of japan
--input-- Question: The nose dipped and alarms went off inside the what? Options: A: car,B: sniff,C: aircraft,D: upper respiratory tract,E: missile, Knowledge: The use of the word "nose" suggests that the context is related to an aircraft, as the nose of an aircraft refers to the front part of the plane.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- aircraft

Options: A: night time,B: run away,C: sleep all day,D: see at night,E: cast shadow, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the car is able to hunt in the dark, which implies that it has some ability to see in low light conditions. The only answer option related to this ability is "see at night." The other options are not relevant to the context of the sentence or are simply opposite in meaning to what is being discussed. Answer is
--target-- see at night
--input-- Question: The bachelor was too lazy to take the groceries out of the shopping bag, he just put the full bags right in his pantry what? Options: A: retail store,B: refrigerator,C: supermarket,D: car trunk,E: storage cabinet, Knowledge: The sentence suggests the bachelor stored the groceries in a place where they could be forgotten, which suggests a place in the home where he wouldn't see them often. The choice 'storage cabinet' makes the most sense, as it's a place where people commonly store non-perishables, such as canned goods and dried foods. The other options, like 'refrigerator' and 'car trunk', wouldn't make sense since the former is a place for perishables and the latter is an inconvenient place to store goods for everyday use. Answer is
--target-- storage cabinet
--input-- Question: If people are scared, why would they get a gun? Options: A: arm themselves,B: to drive their property value down,C: talk to each other,D: lose touch,E: share ideas, Knowledge: The context suggests that people are scared and getting a gun as a response to that fear.

--target-- arm themselves
--input-- Question: When someone is watching a film, what are they hoping for? Options: A: insight,B: being entertained,C: fear,D: erection,E: expectations, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is related to the experience of watching a film. The word "hoping" indicates that the person is looking for a particular outcome or emotional response. While insight may be a secondary goal for some viewers, the primary reason for watching a film is usually to be entertained. Fear and erection may be responses to certain types of films, but they are not universal goals for all viewers. Expectations may be a factor in choosing which film to watch, but they do not directly relate to the experience of watching the film itself. Answer is
--target-- being entertained
--input-- Question: Remembering a terrible event is likely to cause what? Options: A: problems,B: inspiration,C: going to a therapist,D: crying,E: trauma, Knowledge: The sentence implies that remembering a terrible event can have negative emotional consequences, which is commonly associated with the term "trauma."

The other options do not reflect the negative emotional consequences of remembering a traumatic event. Answer is
--target-- trauma

Options: A: park,B: disneyland,C: apartment,D: cows,E: sporting event, Knowledge: The sentence mentions "intermission," which is a term typically used in reference to a break during a performance or event. The fact that hot dogs were selling fast suggests that they were being sold at a venue where people were gathering for an event, such as a sporting event. The other options, including park, Disneyland, apartment, and cows, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- sporting event
--input-- Question: Where might someone go to watch a flute? Options: A: park,B: symphony,C: orchestra,D: music shop,E: musical instrument store, Knowledge: Flute is a musical instrument commonly used in orchestras and symphonies.

--target-- symphony
--input-- Question: Billy is going to sleep.  What will he be for the next few hours? Options: A: snoring,B: not awake,C: loss of consciousness,D: latency,E: sleep walking, Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that Billy is going to sleep, which implies that he will not be awake for the next few hours. The other options may occur during sleep, but they do not accurately describe what Billy will be for the next few hours after he falls asleep. Snoring and sleepwalking are specific behaviors that may occur during sleep, but they do not describe the overall state of being asleep. Loss of consciousness and latency may refer to medical or psychological concepts related to sleep, but they do not accurately describe what Billy will be for the next few hours. Answer is
--target-- not awake
--input-- Question: what period did mammoth's live in? Options: A: ancient times,B: marwell comics,C: forest,D: prehistory,E: museum of natural history, Knowledge: Mammoths are extinct animals that lived during prehistoric times, which is a period of history that dates back millions of years ago.

--target-- prehistory
--input-- Question: What might someone not wanting a hamburger want? Options: A: sandwiches,B: resturant,C: pizza,D: fast food restaurant,E: mouth, Knowledge: The question is asking for an alternative to a hamburger, which is typically a type of fast food made from ground beef. Among the choices, only pizza is also a popular fast food alternative to hamburgers. Sandwiches are too broad of a category and could include hamburgers, while a restaurant or fast food restaurant could serve hamburgers as well. The option "mouth" is clearly a nonsensical choice. Answer is
--target-- pizza

Options: A: office,B: house,C: automobile,D: living room,E: public building, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is facing a long winter commute and that the heater in some vehicle has stopped working.

--target-- automobile
--input-- Question: What would a sick person do if he or she is not treated? Options: A: get better,B: train,C: battle cancer,D: throw up,E: take medicine, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sick person may experience side effects if they do not receive treatment. "Throw up" is a common side effect of many illnesses and may be a sign of an underlying condition that needs to be addressed. "Get better" is unlikely to be the correct answer, as the sentence implies that the person is not getting better without treatment. "Train" and "battle cancer" are not relevant to the context of the sentence, and "take medicine" is the opposite of what is being suggested in the sentence- that the person is not receiving any treatment. Answer is
--target-- throw up
--input-- Question: John thought that Mary was beautiful despite her injury.  But Mary believed that she was what? Options: A: wrong,B: overcast,C: homely,D: bad,E: misshapen, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mary has an injury that affects her appearance, and she believes that this injury makes her less beautiful. The word "misshapen" means that her injury has caused her body to be deformed or distorted in some way, which would explain why she believes she is not beautiful. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- misshapen
--input-- Question: What is typically the attitude of a child waiting for something? Options: A: wisdom,B: anxiety,C: impatience,D: tiredness,E: boredom, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the child is waiting for something, which often leads to impatience. Wisdom, tiredness, and boredom are unlikely attitudes for a child waiting for something specific. Anxiety could be a possible answer, but it would depend on the situation and the child's personal disposition. However, impatience is commonly associated with waiting, especially among children who may lack the emotional maturity to handle delayed gratification. Answer is
--target-- impatience
--input-- Question: What does someone experience after eating lunch? Options: A: numb,B: farts,C: late for work,D: feel full,E: feel sleepy, Knowledge: After eating a meal, especially lunch, it is common to feel full due to the amount of food consumed.

The other options are not associated with the experience of eating lunch, and may not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- feel full
--input-- Question: The committee had more responsibility, they were a fast growing what? Options: A: doughnut shop,B: church,C: office building,D: business,E: government, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the committee had a lot of responsibility and they were part of a fast-growing entity. Doughnut shops, churches, and office buildings may have committees, but they are not typically associated with rapid growth. The term "business" is commonly used to refer to an organization or company, and it is often associated with growth and expansion. Additionally, government is typically not referred to as a "fast-growing" entity, so it is not a likely choice. Answer is
--target-- business
--input-- Question: What is listening a big part of? Options: A: empathy,B: knowlege,C: hear things,D: well being,E: learning, Knowledge: The question is asking for what listening is a "big part" of, suggesting that it is a significant aspect.

--target-- empathy

Options: A: small apartment,B: backyard,C: big house,D: living room,E: mansion, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the reason they only had a small dog is because their living conditions limited their ability to have a larger pet, such as in a small apartment where there may not be enough space for a bigger animal. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they imply more space or different types of living arrangements that are not mentioned in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- small apartment
--input-- Question: He always traveled up the mountain when winter arrived, he had a passion and desire to do what? Options: A: play volleyball,B: play hockey,C: ski,D: knit,E: skate, Knowledge: The sentence mentions winter and traveling up a mountain, which suggests that the person has a sport or activity that he enjoys during the winter season. Among the choices, skiing is the most common winter sport that is often done on a mountain. Playing volleyball, hockey, knitting, or skating do not require traveling up a mountain during winter. Answer is
--target-- ski
--input-- Question: When their engagement has ended what do soldiers get to do? Options: A: use weapons,B: follow orders,C: die in battle,D: hope,E: coming home, Knowledge: The use of the phrase "when their engagement has ended" implies that the soldiers in question were engaged in some sort of military conflict. The choices "use weapons" and "follow orders" are both common activities for soldiers during a conflict, but do not necessarily relate to the end of their engagement. "Die in battle" is a grim option but does not address what happens when the soldiers' engagement has ended. "Hope" is too vague to be a correct answer. "Coming home" is the most logical choice as it suggests that the soldiers will be returning home once their engagement has ended. Answer is
--target-- coming home
--input-- Question: The advertisement appeared outside of a central Wisconsin town, where was it located? Options: A: web page,B: la ville,C: magazine,D: email,E: fargo, Knowledge: The phrase "outside of a central Wisconsin town" suggests that the advertisement was physically placed somewhere near the town. "La ville" means "the town" in French, so this is likely the correct answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- la ville
--input-- Question: It may have many an eye but it doesn't see you peel it's skin off, what is it? Options: A: potato,B: faces,C: lizard,D: person's head,E: mammal, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being described has many eyes but cannot see, and that it has skin that can be peeled off. Only potatoes have "eyes" in the sense of small indentations on their surface from which new shoots can grow. Potatoes also have skin that can be peeled off, unlike faces or people's heads, which have flesh and bone structure, or lizards and mammals, which have scales or fur. Answer is
--target-- potato
--input-- Question: Where would you buy wearable gold? Options: A: church,B: treasure chest,C: jewelry store,D: zoo,E: fort knox, Knowledge: Wearable gold is typically sold in jewelry stores. Jewelry stores specialize in selling all types of jewelry, including pieces made of precious metals like gold. The other options do not make sense, as gold would not typically be sold in a church, treasure chest, zoo, or Fort Knox (which is a United States Bullion Depository). Answer is
--target-- jewelry store
--input-- Question: What is the responsibility of many an adult? Options: A: drink beer,B: drive train,C: sweeping the floor,D: work,E: marry, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the question is asking about a common responsibility that many adults have.

--target-- work
--input-- Question: Where would you store a board game? Options: A: shelf,B: home,C: house,D: basement,E: cupboard, Knowledge: Board games are often stored on shelves or in cupboards as they are typically flat and can be easily stacked or stored in a compact manner. "Home" and "house" are too general and do not suggest a specific location within the home, while "basement" is too specific and not everyone has one. Answer is
--target-- shelf
--input-- Question: What do you do to learn new things for a test? Options: A: television,B: study,C: go to school,D: ask questions,E: fun, Knowledge: The question is asking for a method to learn new material for a test. "Study" is the most relevant choice because it specifically refers to reviewing material in order to learn and remember it. The other choices, such as watching television or having fun, do not necessarily contribute to the process of learning new material. Going to school can be helpful, but it is not specific enough to be the best answer. Finally, while asking questions can be a useful study technique, it is not always applicable or necessary depending on the subject matter. Answer is
--target-- study
--input-- Question: Mary was in motion the whole time.  From per perspective, it looked like everyone else was what? Options: A: stopped,B: stillness,C: standing still,D: static,E: being still, Knowledge: The key phrase in the sentence is "Mary was in motion the whole time," which suggests that everyone else was not moving as much as Mary. The word "standing" also implies a lack of movement, so "standing still" is the most appropriate choice. The other options ("stopped," "stillness," "static," "being still") are either redundant or do not convey the sense of relative movement that is implied in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- standing still
--input-- Question: The fox was caught by animal control, where was it released? Options: A: english hunt,B: burrow,C: woods,D: mountains,E: rural area, Knowledge: The fact that the fox was caught by animal control implies that it was removed from an urban or suburban area, where it may have been causing problems or could be in danger. The options "english hunt," "burrow," and "woods" all suggest confined spaces where the fox would not have been released, while "mountains" may not be a suitable habitat for the animal. "Rural area" is a more general and appropriate option that could be suitable for the release of a wild animal into its natural environment. Answer is
--target-- rural area
--input-- Question: How much water would there be if there was not a little amount of water? Options: A: bog,B: big,C: rain,D: lot of,E: large, Knowledge: The question is asking about the amount of water, and suggests that there is currently only a small amount of water present. The phrase "not a little amount" implies that there is actually a significant amount of water, so the correct answer would be an option that indicates a large quantity. "Big" and "large" both suggest a substantial size or amount, but "lot of" specifically refers to a large quantity of something, making it the most appropriate choice. "Bog" and "rain" do not necessarily indicate a large amount of water, so they can be eliminated as options. Answer is
--target-- lot of
--input-- Question: Where do you get petrol? Options: A: burn hot,B: fuel tank,C: burn hot,D: car,E: gas station, Knowledge: "Petrol" is a term commonly used in British English to refer to gasoline or fuel for vehicles. In this context, the most likely place to get petrol would be a gas station, as that is where vehicles typically go to refuel. The other options, such as "burn hot" and "fuel tank," are not locations where petrol can be obtained. "Car" is also not a suitable option as it is a vehicle that requires petrol to run, not a place to obtain it. Answer is
--target-- gas station

Options: A: mountains,B: arkansas,C: louisiana,D: california,E: south carolina, Knowledge: The question specifies that the person is standing in a coastal, eastern seaboard state.

The other options are not related to this context - a trip suggests traveling, running in could have multiple meanings and falling down implies an accident or injury. Answer is
--target-- working out
--input-- Question: Where can you see a mountain in your own home? Options: A: park,B: switzerland,C: pennsylvania,D: picture,E: canada, Knowledge: The question implies that the answer can be found in the context of one's own home, which rules out options like park or Switzerland which are physical locations. The word "see" suggests that the answer may have to do with visual perception, and "mountain" is a physical object. Therefore, the option "picture" is the most likely answer, as one can see a mountain in a picture or photograph displayed in their home. The other options again do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- picture
--input-- Question: What is a sport that involves hurdles? Options: A: get tired,B: winning,C: have fun,D: hoping,E: running, Knowledge: The question asks about a sport that involves hurdles, indicating that it requires someone to run and jump over obstacles.

--target-- running
--input-- Question: What is a clever way to say someone isn't very good at what they do? Options: A: clumsy,B: dull,C: stupid,D: dummy,E: ineffectual, Knowledge: The word "clever" suggests that the answer is not straightforward or obvious. "Clumsy" implies physical awkwardness rather than lack of skill, "dull" implies boring rather than bad, "stupid" and "dummy" imply a lack of intelligence rather than lack of skill. "Ineffectual," on the other hand, suggests that someone is not getting the job done or achieving their goals, which could imply a lack of skill. Answer is
--target-- ineffectual
--input-- Question: Joe learned some relaxing exercises from his therapist.  They all centered around what sort of action? Options: A: feeling good,B: deep breathing,C: sleeping,D: taking a bath,E: fall asleep, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe learned some exercises to help him relax from his therapist, and that these exercises all had a common focus. The phrase "centered around" implies that there was a central theme or action that the exercises all revolved around.

The other options do not have a strong connection to relaxation or the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- deep breathing

Options: A: anxiety,B: dedication,C: surprised,D: solutions,E: acknowledgment, Knowledge: The word "unexpected" suggests that the person will experience a feeling of surprise when confronted with something they did not anticipate. The other options may not be necessarily related to the context of being confronted with something unexpected. Anxiety may be a possible response, but not all people react this way.

The other options, such as "very heavy" or "very dense" describe physical properties of lead, but do not address its effects on human health. Answer is

Options: A: important,B: calm,C: thundershock,D: surprised,E: expected, Knowledge: The sentence states that James was in shock upon learning something, and the word "not" in the question indicates that it was the opposite of what he expected.

--input-- Question: When I go to Spain, what should I try to practice first? Options: A: stand upright,B: courtesy,C: further education,D: speak spanish,E: cross street, Knowledge: The question is asking for advice on what to practice when going to Spain. Since Spain is a Spanish-speaking country, it makes sense to prioritize practicing speaking the language.

Answer is
--target-- speak spanish

Options: A: hidden,B: synagogue,C: street corner,D: fairy tale,E: hospital, Knowledge: The sentence provides information about the location of the church, which is near a store.

--target-- street corner
--input-- Question: What would happen if you are sleeping well? Options: A: sweat,B: nightmares,C: dreams,D: have fun,E: relaxation, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that sleeping well has a positive effect on the body and mind. One of the primary benefits of sleeping well is relaxation, as the body is able to rest and rejuvenate during the sleep cycle. Sweating and nightmares are not necessarily indicative of good sleep, and while dreaming can occur during sleep, it is not the primary result of sleeping well. "Have fun" is also an unlikely outcome of a good night's sleep. Answer is
--target-- relaxation
--input-- Question: The teen was required to go to school, which made him a what? Options: A: student,B: register,C: old enough,D: put on shoes,E: grouchy, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person mentioned is required to attend school, which is a common characteristic of someone who is a student. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Register" might be a possible answer if the sentence had mentioned the teen needing to register for classes, but that is not the case here. "Old enough" and "put on shoes" are also not relevant to the sentence. "Grouchy" is a possible descriptor of the teen's mood, but it does not answer the question of what the teen is. Answer is
--target-- student

Options: A: accomplishment,B: injuries,C: enemies,D: rivalry,E: death, Knowledge: People often compete in sports in order to achieve a sense of accomplishment, whether it be personal or within a team. Winning can bring a sense of pride and satisfaction, and the feeling of achieving something difficult can be motivating. Injuries are a risk associated with sports, but they are not usually a reason people choose to compete. Enemies and rivalry may be present in some sports, but they are not the primary motivation for most athletes. Death is not a motivation for sports, as it is not an expected outcome of competition. Answer is
--target-- accomplishment
--input-- Question: Sally likes to create art. It's better than sex. Putting brush to canvas gives you what sort of feeling? Options: A: frustration,B: pride,C: communication,D: pleasure,E: work of art, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally enjoys creating art more than having sex, which implies that creating art gives her a feeling of pleasure. Painting can be a form of self-expression and a way to escape from the stresses of everyday life, which may explain why Sally finds it so enjoyable. The other options do not align with the positive connotation of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- pleasure

Options: A: healthy living,B: adventure,C: neatness,D: getting tired,E: injury, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a potential danger associated with cleaning on the 10th floor of an unfinished building.

--input-- Question: Where would you put your foot if it is already covered in cloth? Options: A: desk,B: shoe,C: ground,D: sock,E: table, Knowledge: Since the question mentions that the foot is already covered in cloth, it suggests that the person is wearing some kind of footwear. Out of the options provided, only "shoe" is a type of footwear. It is common to put a cloth-covered foot into a shoe rather than on the ground, desk or table. "Sock" is also a type of footwear, but it is worn underneath a shoe, so it is not the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- shoe
--input-- Question: He truly was a marathon runner, even after running twenty six miles he wasn't even beginning to what? Options: A: vomit,B: getting tired,C: excruciating pain,D: tiredness,E: death, Knowledge: The statement suggests that the person being described is a successful marathon runner, which requires a great deal of physical endurance and stamina. Therefore, after running for such a long distance, it's natural to assume that the person might experience some physical discomfort. However, the use of the phrase "wasn't even beginning to" implies that the person is still feeling relatively good, and not yet facing any major physical symptoms. The other options, such as vomiting, excruciating pain, or death, all suggest much more severe consequences of running a marathon and are less likely to be seen as a natural part of the process. Answer is
--target-- getting tired
--input-- Question: She needed a diaphragm, she went to buy one where? Options: A: valve,B: drugstore,C: human,D: organ,E: person's chest, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a contraceptive device called a diaphragm, which can be purchased from a drugstore. A diaphragm is a type of birth control that is inserted into the vagina, so none of the other options make sense in this context. A valve is a mechanical device used to regulate the flow of fluids or gases, while a human organ and a person's chest are not relevant to the conversation. Answer is
--target-- drugstore
--input-- Question: One reason to keep going to work is what? Options: A: promotions,B: stress,C: bad mood,D: for a party,E: exhaustion, Knowledge: The question asks for a reason to keep going to work, which implies a positive outcome or motivation. "Promotions" is the most logical choice, as it suggests that there is potential for career advancement and increased job responsibilities. "Stress," "bad mood," and "exhaustion" are all negative factors that could make someone want to quit their job, while "for a party" is an irrelevant and nonsensical option. Answer is
--target-- promotions
--input-- Question: Bar service is a very important part of what kind of celebration? Options: A: wedding,B: entertainment,C: hotel,D: train,E: pool party, Knowledge: Bar service is typically a key feature of weddings, where guests often gather to toast the newlyweds and enjoy a celebratory atmosphere. Entertainment venues such as nightclubs and concert halls may also offer bar service, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Hotel bars and train bars may be important amenities for travelers, but this is not necessarily related to celebrations. Pool parties often involve alcohol and socializing, but they are generally more casual and less formal than weddings. Answer is
--target-- wedding
--input-- Question: Where can food stay cold? Options: A: cupboard,B: fridge,C: oven,D: glass,E: table, Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where food can be kept cold, which suggests that the correct answer will be a type of storage container or area that is designed to keep food at a lower temperature. The options "cupboard," "oven," "glass," and "table" do not fit this description, but the option "fridge" does. A fridge (short for refrigerator) is a common household appliance that is designed to keep food at a low temperature to slow down the growth of bacteria and keep food fresh longer. Answer is
--target-- fridge
--input-- Question: Where might you find a penny beside your shoe? Options: A: piggy bank,B: coin purse,C: pocket,D: on the table,E: ground, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the penny is not in a contained space, such as a piggy bank or coin purse, but rather in an open or unsecured location. Additionally, the phrase "beside your shoe" implies that the penny is located on the ground. Therefore, the correct answer is ground. The other options are containers or surfaces where one would typically store or place money. Answer is
--target-- ground
--input-- Question: Why would someone light a fire? Options: A: to burn down a house,B: help people,C: warm hands,D: warm room,E: cleansing, Knowledge: Lighting a fire is commonly done to generate heat and warmth, particularly in colder environments. This can help to make a room more comfortable and pleasant to be in, especially during the winter. The other choices do not necessarily have a clear link to the idea of intentionally lighting a fire. For example, burning down a house would be an act of arson rather than a practical reason for lighting a fire. Helping people or cleansing could potentially involve fire in some cultural or symbolic contexts, but these are less common or specific reasons than warming a room. Answer is
--target-- warm room
--input-- Question: Simon put crayon pictures on the wall of what? Options: A: classroom,B: labyrinth,C: zoo,D: art show,E: prison, Knowledge: The sentence provides context clues that suggest that Simon placed drawings on a wall in a setting related to education. The term "crayon pictures" implies that these were drawn by a child, which would make a school or classroom a likely location. The other options are not connected to education in any obvious way and do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- classroom
--input-- Question: What is someone who is bad unlikely to be called? Options: A: delinquent,B: exceptional,C: advantageous,D: sufficient,E: virtuous, Knowledge: The question asks for a word that a bad person is unlikely to be called. "Virtuous" is a word that describes someone who has high moral standards and behaves in an honorable way, which is the opposite of what a "bad" person would be expected to do. The other words do not necessarily describe behavior or character traits and are not antonyms of "bad." Answer is
--target-- virtuous
--input-- Question: Where would you find a window in a house? Options: A: front door,B: space shuttle,C: wall,D: office,E: car, Knowledge: A window is a type of opening in a wall that allows light and air into a building.

--target-- wall
--input-- Question: What is the reason that playing games sometimes take on a more serious tone? Options: A: entertainment,B: forgetting,C: relaxation,D: competitiveness,E: happiness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that playing games can sometimes become more serious, which implies that there is a competition or challenge involved.

The other options do not explain why games would take on a serious tone. Answer is
--target-- competitiveness

Options: A: entertainment,B: get fat,C: arguments,D: break couch,E: wasting time, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman chose to watch TV instead of going to the gym for physical exercise. This puts her at risk of gaining weight or becoming less fit, which is why "get fat" is the correct answer. The other options may be indirectly related to the situation, but they don't address the immediate risk the woman is facing. Answer is
--target-- get fat
--input-- Question: What is the primary reason for visiting a shop? Options: A: spending of money,B: spend too much,C: purchasing,D: sell items,E: compare prices, Knowledge: The question is asking for the primary reason for visiting a shop, which would likely be to purchase something. While spending money may be necessary to make a purchase, it is not the primary reason for visiting a shop. Spending too much is not a reason for visiting a shop, but rather a potential consequence. Selling items is the purpose of the shop, not the reason for visiting it. Comparing prices may be a step in the purchasing process, but it is not the primary reason for visiting a shop. Answer is
--target-- purchasing
--input-- Question: Businesses giving assistance to those in need build what? Options: A: fear,B: dependence,C: happiness,D: smiles,E: good will, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that businesses that provide assistance to those in need are doing so in a positive and charitable manner. "Good will" refers to the beneficial or favorable attitude or relationship between individuals, businesses, or groups, and is often associated with acts of kindness or generosity.

--target-- good will
--input-- Question: What can be the result of meeting people with similar attitudes? Options: A: anxiety,B: being bored,C: love,D: making new friends,E: new job, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that meeting people with similar attitudes can lead to a positive outcome. People with similar attitudes often share common interests and values, which can lead to a natural connection and potential for friendship.

Love and a new job are possibilities, but are not as directly related to meeting people with similar attitudes as making new friends. Answer is
--target-- making new friends

Options: A: draw,B: listen to music,C: play chess,D: play basketball,E: watch television, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that children engage in a particular activity at home that can be described as addictive. Out of the given choices, watching television is often associated with addictive behavior due to its immersive nature and the availability of countless programs and channels to choose from.

Answer is
--target-- watch television

--target-- green
--input-- Question: What kind of flight cannot be taken to s foreign country? Options: A: imaginary flight,B: american,C: native,D: indigenous,E: domestic, Knowledge: The word "foreign" suggests that the flight in question is leaving the country. Domestic flights are flights that only operate within the borders of a particular country, so they cannot take you outside that country. All the other options (imaginary flight, American, native, and indigenous) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- domestic
--input-- Question: A school is necessary for every one of these. What are they? Options: A: every city,B: community,C: playground,D: residential neighborhood,E: town, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a school is a necessary part of a community. This is because schools provide education and learning opportunities for children and young people who live in that community. The other options may have schools, but the sentence doesn't imply that having a school is necessary for those places to function as they do. For example, playgrounds are important for communities, but not essential for their existence. Answer is
--target-- community

Options: A: advertisement,B: nebraska,C: countryside,D: fairy tale,E: iowa, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a state north of Kansas where cows outnumber people 4 to 1.

In order for the message to be effective, the speaker would likely hope that they are being heard by the listener. The other options do not relate to effective communication or conveying a message. Answer is

--input-- Question: What always happens to someone after he or she finishes getting divorce? Options: A: no spouse,B: lot of grief,C: freedom,D: children suffer,E: party time, Knowledge: The sentence refers to the aftermath of getting a divorce, which typically results in the dissolution of the marriage and the end of the relationship between the spouses. Therefore, the correct answer is "no spouse." The other options, such as "lot of grief" or "children suffer," may be common experiences associated with divorce, but they do not address the specific question of what happens to someone after the divorce is finalized. "Freedom" may be a possible choice, but it lacks the specificity and certainty of "no spouse." "Party time" is unlikely to be a correct answer as it is not a natural consequence of divorce, but rather a personal choice. Answer is
--target-- no spouse

Options: A: sloth,B: condition heart,C: lazy,D: work out,E: couch potato, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exercise is not a common habit for some people, specifically those who are described as "just plain" something. The word "lazy" is commonly used to describe people who don't like to put effort into physical activities, including exercise. The other options, such as "sloth" and "couch potato," are also associated with a lack of physical activity, but they are not as commonly used in everyday language as "lazy." "Condition heart" and "work out" are both related to exercise, but they do not fit the context of the sentence, which is discussing people who do not like to exercise. Answer is
--target-- lazy
--input-- Question: What requires a very strong leader? Options: A: grocery store,B: country,C: organization,D: army,E: pack, Knowledge: The phrase "very strong leader" is often associated with contexts that require strict discipline and command, such as military or army contexts.

Options: A: criticized,B: ask questions,C: make happy,D: have compassion for,E: of service to, Knowledge: The sentence states that the person volunteered to help after a disaster, suggesting that they wanted to provide assistance to those affected. The phrase "able-bodied" further supports this idea, as it implies that the person was physically capable of providing help. The option "of service to" best captures this intention, while the other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Critiqued" and "ask questions" imply a different motive than providing help, while "make happy" does not address the issue of disaster relief, and "have compassion for" suggests a more passive response. Answer is
--target-- of service to

--input-- Question: The meteorologist said that there was a storm coming.  This forced John to delay his trip to what location? Options: A: tropical seas,B: cuba,C: tropics,D: caribbean,E: weather report, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the storm is relevant to a specific location, which is likely where John was planning to go. The options "tropical seas" and "tropics" are too general and could refer to many places, while "Cuba" is a specific country and may not necessarily be where John was headed. "Caribbean" is a region that is often associated with tropical storms and would be a logical location for John to delay his trip to given the meteorologist's warning. "Weather report" is not a location and does not relate directly to John's travel plans. Answer is
--target-- caribbean
--input-- Question: Why might someone continue smoking? Options: A: the smell,B: bad breath,C: pleasure,D: death,E: lung disease, Knowledge: The option "pleasure" is the most likely correct answer because smoking is often associated with feelings of relaxation and enjoyment due to the nicotine content in cigarettes. The other options, such as "death" and "lung disease," are negative consequences of smoking and are generally not reasons why someone would continue to smoke. Additionally, the option "smell" might be a personal preference for some people, but it is not a common reason for smoking. Answer is
--target-- pleasure
--input-- Question: What do you do to meet interesting people? Options: A: online date,B: socialize,C: explore,D: friendly,E: say hello, Knowledge: The word "interesting" suggests that the question is about meeting new people who are engaging or fascinating in some way. One common way to do this is by socializing, which typically involves attending events, joining clubs/groups or engaging in conversations with people. Online dating might also help meet people, but the focus is usually more on finding a romantic partner rather than just making connections. Exploring or saying hello to people can also lead to meeting new people, but it is less likely to result in long-lasting social connections. Being friendly is important, but it's not an action that leads directly to meeting people. Answer is
--target-- socialize

Options: A: cloudy,B: hideous,C: grotesque,D: ugly,E: rain, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that although clear blue skies are nice, there isn't much to see up there if it isn't a little something else. This implies that a little bit of clouds in the sky would make the view more interesting. Therefore, the correct answer is "cloudy." The other options are all negative descriptors and do not fit with the positive tone of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- cloudy
--input-- Question: Billy loved choose, but he didn't put it on his meal because he was watching his weight. He even used a low fat what? Options: A: lot of fat,B: salad dressing,C: strong odor,D: age to get better,E: age well, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy liked something that could be added to a meal, but he chose not to add it because he was watching his weight. The fact that he used a low fat version of it also implies that it is a food item that typically contains fat. Salad dressing is a common food item that is often high in fat, but can also be found in low fat versions. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- salad dressing

Revising and rejecting refer to the process of negotiating the terms and conditions of the contract before it is signed. Written in blood is not a legal requirement for a contract to be valid, and written on paper is another necessary component as it provides a written record of the agreement. Answer is
--target-- signed

Options: A: wins,B: defeat,C: stress,D: aggression,E: sweat, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that competing is a way for some people to release aggression.

Options: A: attached,B: lovable,C: companionable,D: close,E: likely, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people who always hold a remote are not likely to possess a certain trait. The options "attached," "lovable," and "close" refer to emotional connections, and there is no clear connection to remotes. The option "likely" doesn't make sense grammatically. Therefore, the best answer is "companionable," which suggests that those who always hold a remote may not be easy to spend time with because they are focused on their electronic device rather than engaging with those around them. Answer is
--target-- companionable
--input-- Question: Billy wanted to see a Forrest. Where might he go? Options: A: national park,B: temperate zone,C: the forest,D: countryside,E: amazon basin, Knowledge: National parks are often known for their preserved natural sites, including forests. Forests can be found in many places, such as the countryside or the Amazon basin, but the question specifically mentions Billy wanting to see a forest, so the answer that directly relates to forests and their preservation is the national park option. The temperate zone does not provide enough context to know if a forest would be present in that area. Answer is
--target-- national park
--input-- Question: James stove didn't work, so he had to cook where? Options: A: bathroom,B: tent,C: living room,D: apartment,E: friend's house, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is unable to use his stove, so he needs to find an alternative location to cook. The most logical answer is the one that provides an alternative cooking location, which is a friend's house.

--target-- friend's house

Options: A: listen to each other,B: live lives,C: bite,D: fight each other,E: smile, Knowledge: The sentence implies that animals are natural and unencumbered by self-consciousness, which means they behave authentically and without restraint. An animal's primary activity is its biological imperative to survive, which requires it to live a life in accordance with its instincts. The other choices, such as listening, biting, fighting, or smiling, do not accurately capture the essence of how animals behave in the wild. Answer is
--target-- live lives
--input-- Question: This can set in after going to work with to little sleep? Options: A: anger,B: bad mood,C: poor judgement,D: exhaustion,E: boredom, Knowledge: The question states that the condition sets in after going to work with too little sleep. This suggests that the condition is related to being tired, which is a characteristic of exhaustion. Anger and bad mood may be related to exhaustion, but the question specifically mentions going to work, so poor judgement and boredom are less likely to be related to the context. Answer is
--target-- exhaustion
--input-- Question: What would sex in a happy relationship be called? Options: A: nice act,B: wonderful thing,C: making love,D: last hour,E: feel good, Knowledge: The phrase "sex in a happy relationship" suggests an intimate and emotional connection between the individuals involved, which is often associated with the term "making love." The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional and relational aspects of sex in a happy relationship. "Nice act" and "wonderful thing" are vague and could refer to any positive experience, while "last hour" is unrelated to the topic and "feel good" is too general. Answer is
--target-- making love

Options: A: nest,B: everglades,C: high places,D: in washington,E: natural habitat, Knowledge: The sentence mentions the bald eagle as a protected species, which suggests that something has threatened their survival. The word "dwindling" indicates that the thing that threatened the bald eagle's survival was decreasing in number or quantity. The phrase "natural habitat" refers to the environment where a species naturally lives and thrives, so it makes sense that protecting this would help preserve the bald eagle population. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence as well. Answer is
--target-- natural habitat

Options: A: car accident,B: nightmares,C: inspiration,D: wake up,E: hallucination, Knowledge: The context suggests that the artist is not actively creating art, but is waiting for something to happen to spark their creativity. The word "dreaming" implies that the artist is imagining and contemplating rather than actively engaging in their work. The options "car accident" and "nightmares" are negative and have no clear connection to the context. "Wake up" is also unrelated as it suggests the artist needs to snap out of something, while the sentence describes a longer-term issue.

Options: A: oceanography,B: tide pool,C: south pacific,D: dictionary,E: sea water, Knowledge: The term "anemone" is not specific to any one subject or field of study.

Options: A: getting fat,B: being full,C: weight gain,D: hungry,E: eating food, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person has stopped having food, which means that they are no longer eating. The other options suggest reasons why someone may continue to have food, such as getting fat or being hungry, which do not fit the context of the sentence. Being full, on the other hand, is a common reason why someone may stop eating, as they may feel satisfied and no longer need to consume more food at that time. Answer is
--target-- being full

The option "believe in god" is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the sentence's context. Options such as "gain weight" and "own car" are irrelevant and have no connection to the sentence. "Thank God" and "experience joy" may be associated with religious beliefs but are not the most appropriate answers in this context, as the sentence does not suggest gratitude or pleasure. Answer is
--target-- believe in god

Options: A: soft,B: clear,C: half empty,D: recyclable,E: very fragile, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the glass window was delicate and easily broken. The word "transparent" also implies that the glass was clear and easy to see through. The word "thin" further reinforces the idea that the glass was not strong or sturdy. "Soft" and "half empty" do not make sense in the context of describing a glass window, and "recyclable" is not relevant to the situation. Answer is
--target-- very fragile
--input-- Question: Air conditioning makes summers more comfortable in what work spaces? Options: A: house,B: car,C: offices,D: movie theatre,E: cold rooms, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that air conditioning is being discussed in relation to work spaces. While it may be common to have air conditioning in homes, cars, movie theatres, and even cold rooms, the specific focus on work spaces indicates that offices are the correct answer. Air conditioning is often used in office buildings to help regulate temperature and create a more comfortable environment for employees to work in. Answer is
--target-- offices
--input-- Question: What does passionate kissing cause? Options: A: shortness of breath,B: strong feelings,C: feeling good,D: herpes,E: falling down, Knowledge: The word "passionate" suggests intense emotions, and the act of kissing is often associated with romantic or sexual feelings.

Options: A: entertainment,B: getting tired,C: turning off,D: check email,E: fall asleep, Knowledge: Television is commonly used as a form of entertainment, whether it's watching a favorite show, movie, or sporting event. While it's possible to use television to check email or even fall asleep, the context of the answer suggests that the primary purpose is for enjoyment and leisure activities.

--target-- entertainment

Options: A: white house,B: school,C: friend's house,D: museum,E: apartment, Knowledge: The sentence describes a personal space that is decorated with posters, suggesting that it is a place where someone can freely decorate to their liking. It is unlikely to be the White House or a museum, which are public spaces with specific decorum. A school or apartment may not allow for personal decorations in shared areas. Therefore, the most likely option is a friend's house where Suzie can decorate her personal space with posters of her favorite celebrities and interests. Answer is
--target-- friend's house
--input-- Question: Where would you expect to see a human eye? Options: A: faces,B: potato,C: person's head,D: mammal,E: skull, Knowledge: The human eye is a feature commonly found on the face of a person, which is why "faces" and "person's head" are likely answers. "Potato" and "skull" do not have any connection to the context of the question and therefore can be eliminated as options. While "mammal" might be technically correct, it is too general and does not narrow down the answer enough. Answer is
--target-- person's head
--input-- Question: Dave worked hard because he wanted to know what his wife was thinking and feeling.  He put effort into listening to her  and this lead to him understanding her better.  Both of them found something in this. What did they obtain? Options: A: increased knowledge,B: satisfaction,C: friendships,D: compassion,E: increase knowledge, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dave's efforts to listen to his wife and understand her better resulted in both of them finding something. The word "satisfaction" implies that they both felt a sense of fulfillment or contentment as a result of their improved communication and understanding. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence, as they do not necessarily imply a positive outcome from Dave's actions. Answer is
--target-- satisfaction
--input-- Question: What lawn is most likely to be on a street? Options: A: green yard,B: suburbia,C: golf course,D: front yard,E: michigan, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the lawn being referred to is located on a street, which would make the front yard the most probable option. This is because front yards are typically located directly in front of a house and face the street, whereas green yards or suburbia could refer to any type of lawn in any location. A golf course is typically not found on a residential street, and Michigan is a state and not a type of lawn. Answer is
--target-- front yard
--input-- Question: What do many people do to a person on their birthday? Options: A: give gifts,B: receive letters,C: feel embarrassed,D: go to the club,E: thank god, Knowledge: The question is asking about a common practice that occurs on a person's birthday. Giving gifts is a common tradition for birthdays, whereas the other options do not have a clear connection to birthdays. Receiving letters may occur on some birthdays, but it is not as common as giving gifts. Feeling embarrassed, going to the club, and thanking God may occur on some birthdays but are not universal practices. Answer is
--target-- give gifts
--input-- Question: Both sides in World War I used what to cause death that is now banned? Options: A: homicide,B: poisonous gas,C: cyanide,D: nuclear weapons,E: massive weapons, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that during World War I, both sides used a method of causing death that has since been banned. This eliminates options such as nuclear weapons, which did not exist during World War I. Homicide is a general term for killing someone and doesn't specifically refer to the use of a weapon or method of causing death. Cyanide is a poisonous substance, but it was not used on a large scale during World War I as a weapon. "Massive weapons" is also a vague term and does not provide any specific information about what was used during the war. Thus, the correct answer is poisonous gas. Answer is
--target-- poisonous gas
--input-- Question: Where would you expect to see a white fox? Options: A: great outdoors,B: open meadow,C: forest,D: arctic tundra,E: mountains, Knowledge: White foxes, also known as arctic foxes, are commonly found in cold regions such as the arctic tundra. Their white fur helps them blend in with the snowy environment and stay camouflaged from predators. The other options, such as the great outdoors or mountains, are too broad and do not necessarily indicate a specific habitat where white foxes are commonly found. Answer is
--target-- arctic tundra
--input-- Question: What would a person working in an office need after a system crash? Options: A: peaceful sleep,B: compliments,C: freedom from want,D: understand themselves,E: new computer, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person working in the office experienced a system crash, which would likely affect their ability to work on their computer. Therefore, they would need a new computer to continue their work. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- new computer
--input-- Question: Life goes different ways for different folks, sometimes good friends have to what? Options: A: comfort,B: keep secrets,C: leave,D: eat cake,E: part ways, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that life can take different paths for different people, and sometimes that means good friends need to separate or move in different directions. The phrase "part ways" often refers to the end of a friendship or relationship, indicating that this may be the correct answer. The other options (such as "comfort" or "eat cake") do not fit the context of the sentence and do not make logical sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- part ways
--input-- Question: I am hungry, what would be a way to alleviate this? Options: A: very much,B: have food,C: eat vegetables,D: eat quickly,E: make bread, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is in need of nourishment, so the most appropriate solution would be to have some food. The other options may not address the specific need for sustenance and may not effectively alleviate hunger. Eating quickly, for example, may cause discomfort and indigestion. Eating vegetables or making bread may not readily provide an immediate solution to the need for food. Answer is
--target-- have food
--input-- Question: What effect did the TV have on the kids? Options: A: become adults,B: wonder about,C: open door,D: became healthy,E: distracting, Knowledge: The word "effect" implies that the TV had a negative impact on the kids, and the word "distracting" suggests that it prevented the kids from focusing on more productive activities. To "become adults" is a natural process that cannot be attributed to the TV, while "wonder about" and "open door" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Became healthy" is unlikely to be the correct answer as it is not related to the topic of the TV's impact on the kids. Answer is
--target-- distracting
--input-- Question: Billy was doing his homework at the last minute but he could barely think straight.   What might he have been suffering from? Options: A: sneezing,B: cleanliness,C: exhaustion,D: seizure,E: allergies, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Billy was doing his homework at the last minute and was struggling to think clearly, which suggests that he may have been tired or exhausted. Sneezing and allergies don't necessarily cause difficulty thinking, while cleanliness is not related to this context at all. Seizures are a possibility, but there is no direct indication in the sentence that Billy was experiencing one. Answer is
--target-- exhaustion
--input-- Question: Where should watch to avoid being pinched by a crab? Options: A: eastern coast,B: sandy beach,C: fish market,D: north carolina,E: sand dunes, Knowledge: The sentence mentions being pinched by a crab, which implies that the question is related to a beach or shoreline environment. The option "sandy beach" is the most likely correct answer because crabs are commonly found in coastal areas, and sandy beaches are a common type of beach environment where crabs may be present. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not specific enough. Answer is
--target-- sandy beach
--input-- Question: James spent his days at his cottage trying to capture the beauty of the landscape, but he wasn't good at it. He was never good at it.  What isn't he good at? Options: A: mountains,B: dense areas,C: village,D: countryside,E: painting, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is trying to capture the beauty of the landscape, but he isn't good at it. This implies that James lacks skill in the specific area of capturing the beauty of landscapes. The phrase "he was never good at it" reinforces this idea. The other choices may be elements within the landscape, but they are not directly related to James' lack of skill in painting. Answer is
--target-- painting
--input-- Question: After washing clothes in what condition are they? Options: A: cold cloth,B: wet clothes,C: shrinkage,D: wear out,E: get wet, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that clothes have been washed. After washing, clothes typically come out wet and need to be hung up or put in a dryer to dry. The other options are not likely outcomes of washing clothes. "Cold cloth" does not make sense in this context, "shrinkage" and "wear out" describe negative effects that may occur over time with repeated washing, and "get wet" is redundant as clothes already are wet after washing. Answer is
--target-- wet clothes
--input-- Question: Where is pavement usually found? Options: A: ground,B: town,C: city block,D: a race track,E: driveway, Knowledge: Pavement is a hard surface material used to cover the ground in order to make it easier to walk, drive, or ride on. It is commonly found on roads, sidewalks, and other public spaces that are meant for vehicular or pedestrian traffic. While it may often be associated with urban areas such as towns and city blocks, it can also be found in rural areas for things like driveways and pathways. A race track may also have pavement, but it is not a common use for this material. Answer is
--target-- ground
--input-- Question: What do people feel when something good happens? Options: A: experience joy,B: believe in god,C: sadness,D: get sick,E: ask questions, Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a common emotion people feel when something good happens.

--input-- Question: What should one do in order to relieve burnout from staying too long at home? Options: A: elapsed time,B: relaxation,C: exit,D: uneasiness,E: getting there, Knowledge: The sentence mentions "burnout from staying too long at home," indicating that the person is experiencing exhaustion or fatigue from being stuck inside for an extended period of time. The best way to combat burnout in this scenario would be to engage in relaxation activities, such as meditation, yoga, or taking a warm bath. "Elapsed time" does not provide a solution to the problem, "exit" is not relevant to the context, "uneasiness" is the opposite of what is desired, and "getting there" is not applicable to resolving burnout from staying at home. Answer is
--target-- relaxation
--input-- Question: If you are getting in shape you cannot do this when trying to achieve your goals? Options: A: jogging,B: drink water,C: period of recovery,D: give up,E: dieting, Knowledge: The question is asking for something that should not be done when trying to get in shape.

--target-- give up
--input-- Question: The teacher walked up and down the rows of seats checking the belts, then gave the okay for the what to leave? Options: A: school,B: theatre,C: bus,D: hockey game,E: theater, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher is checking belts, which is a common safety measure for buses. The context of the sentence also indicates that the students are getting ready to leave, which further supports the idea that they are on a bus. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- bus
--input-- Question: What do airplanes do? Options: A: carry freight,B: catch on fire,C: stall,D: in the clouds,E: accelerate, Knowledge: While airplanes can certainly catch on fire or stall, and can also fly in the clouds and accelerate, the primary purpose of airplanes is to transport people or cargo. In this case, the language choice "carry" implies something being transported, and "freight" specifically refers to cargo or goods being shipped. Answer is
--target-- carry freight
--input-- Question: Where can you find people trying to alleviate suffering? Options: A: hospital,B: hockey game,C: apartment,D: kitchen,E: water cooler, Knowledge: Hospitals are known for being places where people go to get medical treatment for illnesses or injuries.

In contrast, a hockey game, apartment, kitchen, or water cooler do not have the same connotations of people attempting to alleviate suffering. Answer is
--target-- hospital

Options: A: wings,B: pocket,C: music shop,D: blues band,E: mouth, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is one thing that is necessary for every human to play a harmonica, and the answer choice "mouth" is the only option that makes sense in the context of playing a musical instrument. The other options, such as "wings" and "pocket," are not relevant to playing a harmonica. "Music shop" and "blues band" may be helpful in obtaining a harmonica or playing with others, but they are not necessary for playing the instrument itself. Answer is
--target-- mouth

Options: A: kick and kiss,B: punishment,C: jail time,D: will resent,E: bad karma, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone has hurt someone else that the person loves. In this context, it is likely that the person will feel resentment towards the person who caused harm to their loved one.

Options: A: wrong,B: pleasure,C: encouragement,D: depression,E: relief, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the situation described involves a loss or separation, and the context of ending a marriage implies a significant emotional event. If the person is still in love but the relationship isn't working out, they are likely to feel sad or depressed about the end of the marriage, even if they may also feel relief from the struggles they were facing. The other options do not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- depression

Options: A: know truth,B: own house,C: friendship braclets,D: wonderful memories,E: intelligent children, Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the person and their friends had a "wonderful" weekend trip, indicating that they likely enjoyed their time together and created positive experiences. Memories are lasting and can be cherished for a lifetime, making them a logical answer choice. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, as the sentence does not suggest that the group gained any new knowledge, property, or offspring. Friendship bracelets, while a nice gesture, do not necessarily last a lifetime. Answer is
--target-- wonderful memories
--input-- Question: Tim flies airplanes, but not passenger planes.  He doesn't have to worry about passengers. All he has to do is what? Options: A: arrive late,B: teach,C: catch on fire,D: taxi,E: carry freight, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Tim flies airplanes that are not used for carrying passengers, which leaves only a few possible options. Arriving late, catching on fire, and teaching do not seem relevant to the context. Taxiing might be an option, but the sentence emphasizes that Tim doesn't have to worry about passengers, which suggests he is not transporting people. Therefore, carrying freight is the most likely choice. Freight planes are commonly used to transport cargo, and do not have the same concerns as commercial passenger planes. Answer is
--target-- carry freight
--input-- Question: If you listen to someone talk without talking yourself, you might do what? Options: A: conversation,B: communicate,C: exchange of ideas,D: sharing information,E: obtaining information, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is only listening and not speaking, which implies that they are not actively participating in a conversation or exchanging ideas.

--target-- obtaining information
--input-- Question: As he left he questioned her love, he said if her was true she would what him? Options: A: paint,B: entertain,C: draw,D: wait for,E: please parents, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is questioning the sincerity of the woman's love for him, and implies that if her love were true, she would wait for him. This suggests that the speaker is leaving and may be gone for some time, which would require the woman to wait for him if she truly loves him. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- wait for
--input-- Question: Mice live many places, but what is their native habitat? Options: A: attic,B: laboratory,C: loft,D: town,E: countryside, Knowledge: The word "native" suggests that the answer is referring to the natural or original habitat of mice. While mice can live in a variety of places, their natural habitat is typically in fields or wooded areas, which are typically found in the countryside. The other options, such as attic or laboratory, are not a mouse's native habitat but rather places where they may end up due to human activity. Answer is
--target-- countryside

Options: A: throw up,B: scuba dive in the bath,C: battle cancer,D: get better,E: take medicine, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the sick person is no longer sick, which is typically associated with getting better. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not correspond with the idea of recovering from an illness. "Throw up" and "scuba dive in the bath" are unrelated actions, while "battle cancer" implies a more serious and ongoing illness, and "take medicine" refers to a treatment that may help the sick person get better, but not necessarily guarantee their recovery. Answer is
--target-- get better

Therefore, the most likely option for what someone would call a bazaar in the US is "festival", which can refer to a variety of events that involve food, music, and vendors selling goods. The other options refer to specific regions or cities and do not have a direct connection to the concept of a bazaar. Answer is
--target-- festival
--input-- Question: He drank coffee every morning on his commute, he said it gave him energy for what? Options: A: play sports,B: obesity,C: work,D: wrestle,E: fatigue, Knowledge: The sentence implies a connection between drinking coffee in the morning and gaining energy for a particular activity. The context of drinking coffee during a commute suggests that the activity in question is likely work, as many people drink coffee to help them stay alert and focused during work hours. The other options, such as playing sports or wrestling, do not align with the context of the sentence or the typical benefits of drinking coffee. Obesity and fatigue may be negative effects of a lack of energy, but they are not activities or goals that require extra energy. Answer is
--target-- work
--input-- Question: What might happen after buying too much beer? Options: A: self control,B: intoxication,C: pleasure,D: problems,E: relaxation, Knowledge: Beer contains alcohol which, when consumed in large quantities, can lead to intoxication. Intoxication can cause impaired judgment, loss of coordination, and other effects that would not be associated with self control or relaxation. While pleasure may be a side effect of drinking beer, it is not necessarily a result of buying too much beer specifically. Problems could also be a consequence of buying too much beer, but the question is specifically asking about what might happen after the purchase. Answer is
--target-- intoxication
--input-- Question: The man was in a rut of selfish thoughts and decided to commit suicide, he didn't think of the what it would cause others? Options: A: would die,B: dying,C: pain,D: jubilation,E: end life, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man did not consider the impact his suicide would have on others, specifically the pain it would cause them. This is a common consequence of suicide, as the loved ones left behind often experience intense grief and emotional pain. The other options do not accurately reflect the consequences of suicide or the emotions associated with it. Answer is
--target-- pain

Options: A: experience sadness,B: choke,C: remember everything,D: breathe,E: forget nothing, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the elephant's trunk is above the water while swimming, suggesting that it is using it to breathe. Elephants are known to use their trunk as a snorkel while swimming to breathe, as they cannot hold their breath for long periods of time. The options "experience sadness," "choke," "remember everything," and "forget nothing" do not relate to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- breathe
--input-- Question: Hurting else is a crime, if convicted you could face what? Options: A: jail time,B: punishment,C: bad karma,D: will resent,E: a fight, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hurting someone is a crime and the person could face consequences for it. Jail time is a common punishment for committing a crime and is therefore the most likely option. Punishment is a more generic option that could apply to any type of consequence, but jail time is a specific consequence that is commonly associated with crimes. Bad karma and will resent are not legal consequences and are therefore unlikely options. A fight is also not a legal consequence and is not a appropriate response to a crime. Answer is
--target-- jail time
--input-- Question: Where do you store your groceries when you drive home? Options: A: grocery cart,B: supermarket,C: pantry,D: shelf,E: trunk, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is about where to store groceries while driving home in a car.

Pantry and shelf are not applicable choices as they are not part of a car. Answer is
--target-- trunk
--input-- Question: Where can someone buy a fresh potato? Options: A: farmer's market,B: deep sea,C: bushel basket,D: ireland,E: grocery bag, Knowledge: Fresh produce, including potatoes, is commonly sold at farmer's markets, which are known for carrying locally grown and harvested fruits and vegetables. Deep sea and bushel basket have no connection to potatoes. While Ireland is known for potatoes, the answer is asking where one can buy a fresh potato, and not necessarily in Ireland specifically. A grocery bag may contain potatoes, but it does not specify if they are fresh or not, as grocery stores may sell both fresh and pre-packaged potatoes. Answer is
--target-- farmer's market
--input-- Question: What does waiting for something for a response from an interview cause? Options: A: have fun,B: patience,C: anxiety,D: tedious,E: impatience, Knowledge: The context of waiting for a response from an interview suggests that the individual is likely experiencing feelings of uncertainty, nervousness, and anticipation. These emotions are commonly associated with anxiety, which is a state of heightened mental and physical arousal in response to perceived threats or challenges. The other options, such as having fun or feeling tedious, do not fit the context of waiting for a response from an interview. Patience and impatience are related to waiting, but they do not accurately reflect the emotional state that typically accompanies waiting for an important outcome like a job interview. Answer is
--target-- anxiety
--input-- Question: The ranch house was built outside of Butte, where was it located? Options: A: countryside,B: neighborhood,C: desert,D: montana,E: subdivision, Knowledge: The sentence provides a specific location, Butte, which is a city in the state of Montana. "Countryside" might be a possible option, but it is too broad and generic of a term to accurately describe the location of the ranch house. "Neighborhood" and "subdivision" imply a more urban or suburban setting, while "desert" is not a likely location for a ranch house in Montana. Therefore, "montana" is the best answer. Answer is
--target-- montana
--input-- Question: What device with a lens would you use to take photos? Options: A: microscope,B: device requires optics,C: telescope,D: spoon,E: camera, Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a device with a lens that is used for taking photos. While a microscope and telescope also require optics (lens), they are not typically used for taking photos. A spoon is obviously not a device for taking photos. A camera, on the other hand, is specifically designed to take photos using a lens. Answer is
--target-- camera
--input-- Question: Joe got his kid a plush bald Eagle.  Where did he probably get it from? Options: A: pet shop,B: great outdoors,C: nature reserve,D: canada,E: toy store, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe got a toy for his child (a plush bald eagle), rather than a live animal. This rules out options like pet shop, great outdoors, and nature reserve. The fact that it is a plush toy implies that it was purchased from a store that sells toys, which would be a toy store. Canada is an unlikely option as it is not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- toy store

--input-- Question: The act of traveling is simple, you're just what? Options: A: relocation,B: disorientation,C: meeting new people,D: statue,E: getting somewhere, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of traveling is straightforward and uncomplicated. The phrase "just" implies that the answer is something basic or easy. "Relocation" implies a permanent move, rather than just traveling. "Disorientation" implies confusion or unease, which contradicts the idea that traveling is simple. "Meeting new people" is not necessarily a requirement for traveling. "Statue" is not related to the context of the sentence. "Getting somewhere" is the most straightforward and simple answer that aligns with the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- getting somewhere

The other options either don't make sense or would be harmful to the environment (e.g. leaving leaves in the street could block drains and cause flooding). Answer is
--target-- trees

"Judgement" is a term often used in legal settings to describe a decision reached by a court or jury. "Court house" and "go to jail" are not relevant to this particular sentence, while "death" and "appeals" are potentially related to legal proceedings but do not directly address the question of what the jury had to do to pass sentence.

Options: A: minnesota,B: office building,C: city,D: street,E: fights, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a connection between hockey and a dentist being busy, indicating that there may be an increased demand for dental services in an area where hockey is popular.

Options: A: pennsylvania,B: silo,C: supermarket,D: husks,E: container, Knowledge: The question asks where to get corn if you don't have any, which suggests that you need to acquire it from somewhere else. The most common place to buy corn is at a supermarket, which is a retail store that sells groceries and other household items. The other options do not seem relevant to the context of the question, as Pennsylvania is a state, silos and containers are storage facilities, and husks are a part of the corn plant. Answer is

Options: A: youngstock,B: aged,C: mature,D: old,E: senior, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the young lady was drawn to the man's wealth and did not mind his age. "Old" is the only option that directly relates to age, while the other options do not provide any direct clue to the man's age. "Youngstock" may refer to young animals, "aged" may refer to something that has been aged, but it does not necessarily refer to age in humans, and "mature" and "senior" are often used to denote a certain stage in life but do not necessarily mean old age. Answer is

Options: A: wild,B: glass cage,C: restaurant,D: garden,E: galapagos archipelago, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lizard was originally kept in captivity at the zoo, but the protester stole it and returned it to its natural habitat. Therefore, the correct answer is "wild." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a glass cage is still a form of captivity, a restaurant is not a suitable habitat for a lizard, a garden may not be a suitable habitat for the specific type of lizard in question, and the Galapagos Archipelago is too far away and too specific to be a plausible answer. Answer is
--target-- wild

Options: A: sleepwalking,B: memory loss,C: hypnotized,D: confusion,E: peacefulness, Knowledge: The word "trance" suggests a state of altered consciousness that is often associated with relaxation and peacefulness. The other options, such as sleepwalking or memory loss, do not match the typical characteristics of a trance state. Hypnotized individuals may feel relaxed, but the term "trance" typically refers to a self-induced state of deep relaxation rather than a state induced by a hypnotist. Confusion is not typically associated with trance states. Answer is
--target-- peacefulness
--input-- Question: Sarah tried to manage the evacuation, but it was difficult.  She needed special supplies because all around them was what? Options: A: egypt,B: work area,C: hospitals,D: city,E: desert, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah was managing an evacuation in a location that was difficult to navigate. The phrase "all around them" implies that the environment was a factor in why managing the evacuation was challenging. Of the options listed, "desert" is the most likely to present logistical difficulties during a crisis situation. The other options, such as "Egypt" or "city," could be challenging in their own right, but do not necessarily suggest the same kinds of obstacles as a desert environment. Answer is
--target-- desert

--input-- Question: Where is a person doing housework likely to work? Options: A: house guest,B: nice home,C: boredom,D: become tired,E: low pay, Knowledge: The question is asking about where someone doing housework is likely to work, so it makes the most sense that they would be working in a nice home, as housework is typically associated with maintaining a clean and tidy living space.

The sentence also suggests that Charlie had a desire to learn, which makes it more likely that he turned to self-education. Of the choices, reading books is the most likely method for self-education, as it can be done at any time and from any location. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well. Answer is
--target-- read book

Options: A: dashing each others,B: intimacy,C: riots,D: happiness,E: headaches, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that celebrating sports teams can sometimes become uncontrollable and chaotic. "Riots" is the most logical choice as it is commonly associated with such situations. "Dashing each others" is nonsensical and "intimacy" and "happiness" do not fit the context of the sentence.

--target-- riots

Options: A: lose your laces,B: getting hot,C: feeling tired,D: working out,E: lack of energy, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is related to physical activity or exercise, specifically running. When you run, your body warms up and generates heat, which can cause your feet to sweat and your shoes to feel hot.

Options: A: make eye contact,B: language,C: listening,D: compliment,E: smile, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question valued formality and likely made an effort to display proper social behavior.

--target-- house
--input-- Question: Where would you keep a business telephone directory? Options: A: office,B: house,C: book shelves,D: phone booth,E: building, Knowledge: A business telephone directory is typically used in a professional or work setting, so it would make sense to keep it in an office where it would be easily accessible to employees who need it. The other options, such as a house or phone booth, do not make sense as places to keep a business telephone directory. Book shelves or a building might be possible options, but office is the most specific and appropriate choice given the context. Answer is

--input-- Question: James's duffel bag was too heavy to carry with him, so he left it where? Options: A: bag lady's shopping cart,B: army barracks,C: bus station,D: locker room,E: transit, Knowledge: The sentence implies that James needed to store his duffel bag temporarily because he couldn't carry it with him. The options "bag lady's shopping cart" and "army barracks" are not likely locations for James to store his personal belongings. "Bus station" and "transit" are also unlikely options as they imply that James was travelling, which is not specified in the sentence. "Locker room" is the most suitable option as it is a common place for people to store their personal items when they don't want to carry them around. Answer is
--target-- locker room
--input-- Question: He chuckled to himself while hiking because of a saying, he had spotted a what on the mountain? Options: A: plains,B: molehill,C: crash plane,D: dale,E: anthill, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the protagonist found something amusing while hiking, and that it was related to a saying. The next part of the sentence mentions "spotted a what," implying that the protagonist saw something on the mountain. The word "Chuckled" suggests that whatever he saw was not serious or dangerous. Thus, among the options, a molehill fits the context best. It is a small and harmless feature of the landscape that is not commonly spotted while hiking, and it can be humorously compared to a mountain. The other options don't fit as well because they are either too big or too difficult to spot while hiking. Answer is
--target-- molehill

Going to jail is a common punishment for criminal activities and is a reasonable choice for Joe to be worried about.

Answer is
--target-- going to jail

Options: A: canter,B: trot,C: eat oats,D: herd,E: drink water, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the horses are moving quickly in a specific direction, which is a characteristic of the canter gait. Canter is a three-beat gait that is faster than a trot, but not as fast as a gallop. Trot is a two-beat diagonal gait, while eat oats and drink water are completely unrelated to the question.

The YMCA and California are both too broad to determine whether they have isolated swimming pools. Answer is
--target-- resort hotel

Options: A: medicine cabinet,B: pharmacy,C: jar,D: medicine bottle,E: box, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object is specifically designed for storing and dispensing pills. The options "medicine cabinet," "pharmacy," and "box" are too general and could refer to a variety of objects that may or may not be used for storing pills. "Jar" is too vague and does not necessarily imply a twisting motion to dispense pills. "Medicine bottle" is the most specific and appropriate option, as it is a common household item used for storing and dispensing medication, and often requires a twisting motion to open. Answer is
--target-- medicine bottle

Options: A: sweden,B: health centre,C: backyard,D: house,E: country club, Knowledge: The question asks about a place where a spa is likely to be found alongside similar services, which suggests a location that specializes in health and wellness. Out of the given options, a health centre is the most likely option to offer a spa alongside other health-related services such as massages or acupuncture, for example. Sweden, backyard, house or country club do not necessarily have a clear connection to health and wellness services or spas. Answer is

--input-- Question: Thrill seeking people who love competition might be found in one of these? Options: A: learn from each other,B: fight each other,C: fear death,D: a taxi cab,E: race cars, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that thrill seeking people who love competition could possibly be found in one of the choices provided. Out of the options, "race cars" is the most likely choice as it is a competitive sport that involves speed and danger, attracting thrill seekers who enjoy taking risks. The other choices, such as "a taxi cab," "learn from each other," and "fear death," do not correlate with the idea of competing and seeking thrills. "Fight each other" could be seen as competitive, but the sentence implies that the choice is related to a specific activity or location, rather than a general behavior. Answer is
--target-- race cars
--input-- Question: When the man was preparing for having a bath, what did he look for in the water? Options: A: being clear,B: get wet,C: bathing soap,D: will drown,E: personal cleanliness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was preparing for a bath and was looking for a specific quality in the water. The phrase "being clear" indicates that the man was searching for water that was transparent and free from impurities or dirt. This is a common expectation when someone is preparing for a bath, as the purpose of the bath is usually to clean oneself. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "get wet" is not something one needs to search for when preparing for a bath, "bathing soap" is an accessory and not a quality of the water, "will drown" is not a desirable outcome of bathing, and "personal cleanliness" is the purpose of the bath, not a quality of the water. Answer is
--target-- being clear

Options: A: bookstore,B: count till,C: supermarket,D: shop,E: preschool, Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sam's job involves handling cash as a cashier, and he is good at it despite the hectic and tiring nature of the job. Among the choices, only a supermarket is commonly known to have cashiers who may work in a standing position and handle a lot of customers, making it a more likely workplace for Sam. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- supermarket
--input-- Question: The gentleman from France wanted to join what? Options: A: suit,B: europe,C: university,D: club,E: church restaurant, Knowledge: The word "gentleman" suggests that the person in question is a male of good breeding and manners. The fact that he is from France is also relevant, as it suggests that he may be interested in joining a social or cultural organization where he can meet fellow French expats, or perhaps an international club where he can network and socialize with people from all over the world. The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, as they are either too general (europe) or unrelated to the idea of socializing and networking (suit, university, church, restaurant). Answer is
--target-- club
--input-- Question: She knew what presents she was getting, none of them were what she wanted and so she felt what? Options: A: excited,B: ownership,C: satisfaction,D: being happy,E: disappointment, Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that the presents she was getting were not what she wanted, which suggests she had expected or hoped for something specific. This indicates that she may have been looking forward to receiving a particular gift that did not end up being part of her presents, leading to disappointment. The other options, such as excitement or satisfaction, would not be appropriate in this context where the speaker is unhappy with the nature of the gifts they were receiving. Answer is
--target-- disappointment
--input-- Question: What do people fear when they speak of crossing over? Options: A: making cake,B: fear death,C: fight each other,D: talk to each other,E: race cars, Knowledge: The phrase "crossing over" is often used as a euphemism for dying or passing away.

--input-- Question: What does someone need when they're feeling hunger? Options: A: starvation,B: eat hamburger,C: eating,D: pizza,E: discomfort, Knowledge: The question is asking what someone needs when they're feeling hunger, so the best answer would be the option that satisfies that need. Hunger is a biological signal that our bodies use to signal the need for food, so the correct answer would be "eating". The other options are either inappropriate (starvation) or specific foods that may or may not be able to satisfy hunger (hamburger, pizza) or a symptom of hunger rather than the need itself (discomfort). Answer is
--target-- eating
--input-- Question: She had to finish reading book for school, but it was late and she kept what? Options: A: fall asleep,B: falling asleep,C: learning,D: sit,E: the light on, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is struggling to finish reading a book because they are tired or sleepy. The phrase "kept" implies that the person is trying to stay awake, but is having difficulty doing so. "Falling asleep" is the most likely choice because it accurately reflects this situation. "Sit" and "learning" do not make sense in this context, and "the light on" is a distractor that does not relate to the sentence. Answer is
--target-- falling asleep
--input-- Question: After the killing of another young member of the community people began to really what? Options: A: get in trouble,B: commit crime,C: die,D: feel anger,E: getting hurt, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the killing of a young community member has caused a strong emotional reaction among people. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Get in trouble" and "commit crime" imply that people are somehow responsible for the killing, which is not necessarily the case. "Die" and "getting hurt" are also not logical responses to the situation. Answer is
--target-- feel anger
--input-- Question: What happens when people have no nourishment? Options: A: board ships,B: suffer hunger,C: study books,D: play computer games,E: believe in god, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when people have no nourishment, they experience a negative consequence. The phrase "suffer hunger" directly relates to the lack of nourishment, whereas the other options do not.

--target-- suffer hunger
--input-- Question: Sahmbi was  lying about the fugitive's location.  He was lying because he wanted to avoid legal what? Options: A: confusion,B: being found out,C: hurt feelings,D: being fired,E: trouble, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Sahmbi was intentionally misleading someone about the location of a fugitive, and the reason he was doing this was to avoid facing consequences or punishment. The term "trouble" is often used to describe negative consequences that someone may face for their actions, which is why it is the most likely choice in this context. The other options do not fit as well because they do not convey the sense of negative consequences that the sentence suggests. Answer is
--target-- trouble
--input-- Question: What could you be doing if you are relaxing and are awake but have your eyes closed? Options: A: read book,B: listening to music,C: falling asleep,D: watching tv,E: reading, Knowledge: The question states that you are relaxing and have your eyes closed, which suggests that you are engaging in an activity that does not require visual focus. The options "read book", "watching tv", and "reading" all involve visual engagement, which is therefore unlikely. "Falling asleep" is also unlikely since the question specifies that you are still awake. "Listening to music", however, is an activity that can easily be done with eyes closed and also fits the context of relaxation. Answer is
--target-- listening to music
--input-- Question: What is a body of water similar to a stream is called? Options: A: synagogue,B: pastry,C: ocean,D: brook,E: cup of coffee, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the answer must be a body of water that is similar to a stream. A brook is a small, shallow stream, while a synagogue and pastry have no connection to the context of the sentence. An ocean is a large body of saltwater and is not similar to a stream. A cup of coffee is a beverage and not a body of water. Answer is
--target-- brook
--input-- Question: Some cars have racing lines on them called? Options: A: seat belts,B: breaks to help stop,C: designs,D: stripes,E: radios, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lines on the car are related to racing, which is a sport associated with speed and competition.

--input-- Question: Why do people primarily partake in surfing? Options: A: getting in shape,B: to get wet,C: getting wet,D: enjoyment,E: shark attacks, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a specific reason why people participate in surfing, and the word "primarily" implies that this reason is the main motivation for most surfers. While getting in shape and getting wet may be secondary benefits of surfing, neither of these options reflects the main reason why people choose to partake in the sport. Shark attacks, although they are a risk associated with surfing, are not a reason why someone would choose to surf. Therefore, enjoyment is the most likely correct answer. Surfing is a popular recreational activity that is enjoyed by many people around the world, and the exhilaration of riding waves is often cited as the primary reason why people choose to participate in it. Answer is
--target-- enjoyment
--input-- Question: If you're releasing energy through running, what will you likely find on your skin? Options: A: sweat,B: movement,C: exercising,D: sex,E: moist, Knowledge: When we exercise and run, our body temperature increases, and we start to sweat to cool down. Sweat is a clear fluid that is released through the sweat glands in our skin, and it helps regulate our body temperature. Movement, exercising, and sex are all associated with physical activity, but they do not specifically relate to the act of sweating during exercise. Moist could be a possibility, but it is not as specific as sweat in this context. Answer is
--target-- sweat

--target-- united states of america
--input-- Question: What in a car could have an led? Options: A: electronics,B: dashboard,C: electronic equipment,D: display,E: pc board, Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the answer refers to a feature found in a car. An LED (light-emitting diode) is commonly used in electronic displays, which are often found on a car's dashboard to show information such as speed and fuel levels. The other options, such as electronics and pc board, are too broad and do not narrow down the answer to a specific part of a car. Answer is
--target-- dashboard

--target-- bowling alley

Options: A: band,B: opera,C: show,D: fine tune instruments,E: ball, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exceptional performances are being referenced, which is typically associated with a live show. While bands, operas, and ball events can all provide live shows, the word "performances" is a key word that highlights the relevance of the choice "show" over the others. The phrase "fine tune instruments" is unlikely to be the correct answer, as it does not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- show
--input-- Question: Where is your condo if you're drinking Schlitz? Options: A: residential area,B: city,C: milwaukee,D: suburbia,E: schlitztown, Knowledge: Schlitz is a beer that was originally brewed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

--target-- beach
--input-- Question: The Mormon owned steak house was always busy, it was a great place to visit where? Options: A: utah,B: nebraska,C: the sun,D: new york,E: strip mall, Knowledge: The reference to the Mormon ownership of the steak house suggests a connection to the state of Utah, which has a sizable population of Mormons. Additionally, the fact that the steak house is always busy implies that it is located in a popular area, and Utah's reputation as a tourist destination makes it a likely choice. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- utah
--input-- Question: What do you conduct drinking out of? Options: A: glass,B: choking,C: smoke,D: swallowing,E: mouth, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a container that one uses to drink out of.

They did this because it gave them more what? Options: A: stress,B: aggravation,C: efficiency,D: freed up time,E: net gain, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that splitting up tasks into nearby blocks was a deliberate choice made by Joe, John, and Sylvia, implying that there was some practical benefit to doing so. The use of the word "efficiency" in the answer reflects this implication, as it suggests that dividing tasks in this manner allows for the completion of all tasks in a quicker and more streamlined manner. The other options (stress, aggravation, freed up time, net gain) do not seem to logically match with the idea of splitting up tasks into nearby blocks. Answer is
--target-- efficiency

While there may be exceptions to this, such as when the lie is told to protect the other person, the question does not provide any context that would suggest that this is the case. The other answer choices are not relevant to the question and do not provide any logical reason or context to support their selection. Answer is
--target-- unhappiness

Options: A: orchestra,B: jazz band,C: rock band,D: music store,E: music studio, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Artie Shaw became famous playing the clarinet, which is an instrument commonly associated with jazz music.

--input-- Question: A kitchenette is common in what dwellings that are stacked on top of each other? Options: A: house,B: dormroom,C: one story apartment,D: apartment,E: hotel room, Knowledge: The word "kitchenette" suggests a small kitchen area, which is often found in apartments rather than houses or dorm rooms. The phrase "stacked on top of each other" implies that the dwelling type is a multi-story building like an apartment complex, and not a one-story apartment or a house. A hotel room may have a mini-fridge and a microwave, but these do not qualify as a kitchenette. Answer is
--target-- apartment
--input-- Question: All the business owners had a monthly committee meeting, it was to introduce new tenants and discuss issues of the what? Options: A: town,B: office building,C: boardroom,D: government,E: city hall, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the meeting was specifically for business owners, suggesting that it was held in a location where multiple businesses are housed together. The term "committee" also suggests that this meeting was held internally among the business owners, rather than a meeting hosted by a city or government entity. The options town, government, and city hall do not fit the context of the sentence, while boardroom does not necessarily imply a meeting among business owners. Therefore, office building is the most fitting choice. Answer is
--target-- office building
--input-- Question: In the city the family didn't have a back yard, but now they did since they lived in a what? Options: A: farm,B: suburb,C: property,D: neighborhood,E: yards, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the family previously lived in the city where they didn't have a back yard, but now they do. This indicates that they likely moved to a more residential area. The options "farm" and "property" imply a larger land area than a typical residential property, making them less likely choices. "Neighborhood" and "yards" are also too generic and do not provide specific information about the family's living situation. Therefore, "suburb" is the most appropriate answer as it implies a residential area with houses and yards. Answer is
--target-- suburb
--input-- Question: Where are student likely to utilize a parking structure? Options: A: college campus,B: mall,C: big city,D: behind the garage.,E: chicago, Knowledge: Parking structures are commonly utilized at places with high traffic and limited space, such as college campuses.

--target-- college campus
--input-- Question: You can hang laundry in the sun to do what? Options: A: warm room,B: dry clothes,C: warm house,D: fade color,E: brown skin, Knowledge: Hanging clothes in the sun is a common method used to dry laundry quickly and naturally. Sunlight helps to evaporate moisture from the fabric, which is why it is often used as a laundry drying method. The other options do not make sense in this context - warming a room or a house would not be achieved by drying clothes outside, fading colors would be an unwanted result of exposure to sunlight, and promoting browning of skin implies sun tanning, which is not related to laundry. Answer is
--target-- dry clothes
--input-- Question: Dinner was finished and the dishes cleared, the bust boy then wiped all the crumbs off the what? Options: A: box of crackers,B: face,C: rug,D: table,E: floor, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bus boy was cleaning up after dinner, and specifically mentions clearing the dishes.

--target-- table
--input-- Question: How is a soldier likely to travel? Options: A: carriage,B: armored car,C: trenches,D: tent,E: battlefield, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about transportation used by soldiers in combat or on the move. Carriages and tents are unlikely choices as they are not practical for military operations. Trenches are not a mode of transportation, but rather a form of defensive structure. The most practical mode of transportation for soldiers on the move or in combat situations is an armored car, which offers protection and mobility. The option "battlefield" is not a mode of transportation, but rather a place where soldiers engage in combat. Answer is
--target-- armored car

Options: A: shelf,B: gas station,C: bed,D: home,E: toy store, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person keeps their teddy bear in their own room, which is typically found in their home. The other options do not make sense in this context. A shelf may be in a home, but it does not necessarily indicate that a teddy bear is kept there. A gas station is not a logical place to keep a teddy bear. A toy store is where teddy bears are sold, not kept by individuals. Answer is
--target-- home
--input-- Question: Where would you go to take a chair home? Options: A: home,B: university,C: office,D: furniture store,E: church, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to acquire a chair to take home, which can be done by purchasing one from a furniture store. A furniture store is a retail business that sells furniture, such as chairs and other household items. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a university, office, or church may not have chairs available for purchase, and going home would not provide a solution for acquiring a new chair. Answer is
--target-- furniture store
--input-- Question: Where can you buy previously owned metal items? Options: A: instruments,B: hobby lobby,C: junkyard,D: ore,E: car, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a place to buy previously owned metal items. Hobby Lobby and instruments may sell metal items, but they are unlikely to sell used items. Ore is a type of raw material used to make metal, not a place to buy used metal items. Cars may contain metal parts, but they are not a place to specifically buy used metal items. A junkyard, on the other hand, is a common place to find previously owned and used metal items, making it the most likely correct answer. Answer is
--target-- junkyard
--input-- Question: where are people likely to be joyous? Options: A: convention,B: supermarket,C: theater,D: wedding,E: church, Knowledge: Weddings are typically joyful events where people come together to celebrate the union and love between two people.

Options: A: introduced,B: foreigner,C: alien,D: immigrant,E: guide foreigners, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sean found his native English speaking ability helpful, implying that Ludwig did not have the same advantage. The word "foreigner" is the only option that directly relates to the idea of not being a native speaker of a language. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- foreigner
--input-- Question: What type of breathing can be dangerous? Options: A: stay alive,B: continue to live,C: hyperventilation,D: relaxation,E: panting, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a type of breathing that can be harmful, which rules out the options "stay alive" and "continue to live" as they are not types of breathing. Hyperventilation is a known medical condition where a person breathes rapidly and shallowly, which can lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide levels in the blood and cause symptoms such as dizziness, tingling, and chest pain. In contrast, "relaxation" and "panting" are not typically associated with any significant health risks. Answer is
--target-- hyperventilation
--input-- Question: What does a person want to fit in with? Options: A: goverment,B: nature,C: society,D: natural world,E: humanity, Knowledge: The word "fit in" implies a desire to belong or conform to a larger group. Out of the given choices, only society refers to a group of people with shared values, beliefs, and customs. The other choices, such as government and nature, do not necessarily involve a sense of belonging or conformity. The natural world and humanity are very broad categories that do not necessarily involve social interaction. Answer is
--target-- society
--input-- Question: When people have conflicts with one another, what might happen? Options: A: party,B: agree or disagree,C: gain weight,D: believe in god,E: become angry, Knowledge: The word "conflicts" suggests a disagreement or argument between people, which often leads to negative emotions such as anger. "Party" and "believe in god" are not necessarily related to conflicts, while "agree or disagree" is an action that may or may not lead to anger. "Gain weight" does not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- become angry
--input-- Question: Living life is about good and bad experiences and doing what from them? Options: A: make love,B: get married,C: have children,D: learning,E: repeating, Knowledge: The sentence states that living life involves both good and bad experiences, and suggests that we should do something with them. "Learning" is the most logical option, as it implies that we can gain knowledge or wisdom from our experiences, both positive and negative, and use that knowledge to improve ourselves or our situations in the future. The other options - making love, getting married, having children, and repeating - do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- learning
--input-- Question: What is a place where every creature lives? Options: A: world,B: zoo,C: dark place,D: lake,E: woods, Knowledge: The question is asking for a place where all creatures live, which suggests a broad and inclusive location. The world is a logical answer because it encompasses all living creatures across different environments such as oceans, forests, and deserts. The other options do not satisfy this requirement: zoos only contain a limited number of species in captivity, dark places like caves and underground tunnels may not support all types of creatures, lakes only support aquatic life, and woods may not have all species in significant numbers. Answer is
--target-- world

Options: A: desk,B: house,C: at hotel,D: bedroom,E: library, Knowledge: A library is a place where multiple people can access and use resources, such as books or newspapers. It is common for libraries to have only one telephone book that patrons can use, as it is not necessary for each individual to have their own copy. The other options, such as a desk or bedroom, are usually private spaces that are not intended for public use. Similarly, while a hotel may have a telephone book, it is not typically available for general use by guests. Answer is
--target-- library

--input-- Question: Where could you find a library that only friends can visit? Options: A: college,B: hotel,C: school,D: house,E: downtown, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the library is restricted to only friends, which implies a personal or private setting. College, hotel, school, and downtown are all public places where anyone can go, so they are less likely to have a restricted-access library. A house, on the other hand, can be a private residence where only friends are allowed, making it a more plausible location for a library that only friends can visit. Answer is

Options: A: shiver,B: shrinkage,C: become cold,D: not dry,E: get melted, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that not using a towel after getting wet could lead to a physical reaction in the body. Shivering is a natural response to feeling cold, and if the body is wet and not dried off, it may feel cold and shiver in an attempt to warm up.

A phone booth is a public space that is specifically designed for making phone calls, whereas the other options do not have any clear connection to public phone calls.

Options: A: front door,B: zoo,C: jail cell,D: residence,E: floor, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat is an indoor-only pet, which implies that it stays inside a residence of some sort. The other options do not make sense in this context - a front door is not a place to stay, a zoo is not a suitable environment for a house cat, and a jail cell is a completely inappropriate location. "Floor" is too general and could apply to any indoor space. Answer is
--target-- residence
--input-- Question: When do you bring a clock to a clockmaker? Options: A: stop working,B: store,C: time event,D: tell time,E: wind down, Knowledge: A clockmaker is someone who repairs and maintains clocks.

Options: A: space shuttle,B: building,C: on the lawn,D: friend's house,E: wall, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the view of stars through a window is not something that occurs commonly or easily. The phrase "out the window" implies a view from above, which suggests that the context is related to flying or being in space.

--target-- space shuttle

Options: A: catch cold,B: yell,C: talk to themselves,D: open doors,E: study greek, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that talking to oneself is a behavior that may lead others to think a person is crazy.

Options: A: mountain,B: hatred,C: gorge,D: fantastic,E: cliff, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is unhappy with the plain landscape of their new home, which could indicate a preference for a different type of geography. The word "miss" also implies that the person had experienced a different type of geography before. Of the options, "mountain" is a type of geography that is often associated with grandeur and beauty, which may explain why the person misses it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- mountain

Options: A: get messy,B: cleaning,C: get dirty,D: getting dirty,E: being dirty, Knowledge: The sentence implies that Brenda made a considerable effort to clean herself, which suggests that she disliked being dirty or unclean. The options "get messy," "cleaning," and "get dirty" are not correct because these actions are not being complained about. The only remaining option is "getting dirty," but this is in present tense which doesn't match the past tense of the sentence. Therefore, "being dirty" is the only logical choice. Answer is
--target-- being dirty
--input-- Question: The lizard tried to stay cool by resting in what sort of location? Options: A: sunny place,B: rocky areas,C: shady spot,D: garden,E: dirt, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lizard is trying to avoid the heat, which means it is likely looking for a cooler location. The options "sunny place" and "rocky areas" are both associated with heat and exposure to sunlight, so they are unlikely to be the correct answers. "Garden" and "dirt" do not provide any specific information that would suggest they are better locations for the lizard to rest. "Shady spot" is the most likely answer because it provides a cooler and more comfortable location for the lizard to rest. Answer is
--target-- shady spot
--input-- Question: After being on his feet all day he told his boss he was taking a break and doing what on the bench? Options: A: not working,B: relaxation,C: renewal,D: sleep,E: sitting down, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was tired from standing all day and decided to take a break.

Options: A: travel,B: go somewhere,C: ride bike,D: play frisbee,E: climb, Knowledge: Mountains are commonly associated with activities such as climbing or hiking. However, these activities can be dangerous or impossible to do if the weather is not good. Mountain climbing requires clear visibility and stable ground conditions, and bad weather like rain or snow can make it difficult to climb safely. The other options (travel, go somewhere, ride bike, play frisbee) are more general and do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- climb
--input-- Question: The roadway had fallen into disrepair, the citizens took their complaints to the where? Options: A: neighborhood,B: city,C: govenor,D: subdivision,E: countryside, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the citizens are complaining about the condition of a roadway, which is something that falls under the responsibility of a city government. Neighborhoods and subdivisions may have their own local authorities, but they would not have the authority or resources to address major road repairs. The governor may have some influence over state-funded roadway projects, but this is unlikely to be the first point of contact for citizens with complaints about local infrastructure. The countryside is too broad a term to have any relevance to this sentence. Answer is
--target-- city
--input-- Question: She said you had to pay extra for her to swallow semen, something you'd only hear from a what? Options: A: you're curious,B: prostitute,C: pornstar,D: gay man in love,E: you're into, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the act of paying for someone to swallow semen is a transactional or commercial one. This is a common practice in the sex industry, especially with prostitutes who may offer additional services for an extra fee. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, as they do not involve the exchange of money or sexual services. Answer is
--target-- prostitute
--input-- Question: Where should you look for your yoyo if it was stolen by a bratty young person? Options: A: toy store,B: toy shop,C: brother's room,D: toy factory,E: own home, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the yoyo was stolen by a bratty young person, which suggests that it may have been taken by someone who had access to the yoyo and knew that it was valuable or desirable. The options "toy store," "toy shop," and "toy factory" are unlikely to have the stolen yoyo because they are not associated with the context of the sentence. "Own home" is also unlikely because the sentence suggests that the yoyo was stolen, which means it is not in the possession of the person who owns it. "Brother's room" is the most likely option because the bratty young person may have been a sibling or someone who had access to the owner's room. Answer is
--target-- brother's room
--input-- Question: Opening business was a passionate dream of his, but he'd be lying if he didn't want to what too? Options: A: busy,B: get rich,C: bankruptcy,D: wealth,E: live the dream, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while the person's passion was to open a business, they also had a desire to become wealthy. This is supported by the use of the phrase "he'd be lying if he didn't," indicating that the desire for wealth is something the person is not admitting openly. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they either have a negative connotation (bankruptcy) or are too broad (live the dream, busy). Answer is
--target-- get rich
--input-- Question: The teach was very enthusiastic, she got all the children involved and they would all what? Options: A: ride horses,B: learn together,C: play games,D: watch tv,E: sing a song, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the teacher got all the children involved, which suggests a learning environment.

Answer is
--target-- learn together
--input-- Question: What does a round glass do? Options: A: break easily,B: many different colors,C: shattering,D: hold my doughnuts,E: hold water, Knowledge: A round glass is typically used for holding liquids, such as water or other beverages.

Options: A: candle,B: room,C: lamp,D: hallway,E: sky, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people were struggling to see which parts of the wall needed a second coat of paint because they did not have enough light. Therefore, it makes sense that they would plug in another light source to provide additional illumination. A lamp is a common household item used for lighting, so it is a likely choice in this context. The other options do not make sense in the given situation. Answer is
--target-- lamp
--input-- Question: If I was using a hairpin on a female customer where do I need to put it? Options: A: woman's hair,B: hair salon,C: bathroom cabinet drawer,D: forehead,E: barber shop, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker is using a hairpin on a female customer, which suggests that the hairpin is intended for use in styling or securing the customer's hair. The options "hair salon" and "barber shop" suggest places where one might use a hairpin, while "bathroom cabinet drawer" and "forehead" are unlikely locations for using a hairpin on someone else's hair.  Therefore, the correct answer is "woman's hair." Answer is
--target-- woman's hair
--input-- Question: Where are pictures kept with magnets? Options: A: bedroom wall,B: newspaper,C: suitcase,D: attic,E: fridge, Knowledge: The question is asking about a location where pictures are kept with magnets.

Options: A: supermarket,B: hotel room,C: garbage,D: closet,E: medicine cabinet, Knowledge: The word "disposable" suggests that the razor is intended to be thrown away after a single use, which means it would likely end up in the garbage. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Supermarkets and hotel rooms have no clear connection to disposable razors, while a closet or medicine cabinet are not likely places for disposing of them. Answer is
--target-- garbage
--input-- Question: What meal usually has carrots and mostly leafy vegetables? Options: A: cellar,B: salad,C: store,D: refrigerator,E: soup, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the meal being referred to contains carrots and leafy vegetables.

Options: A: store,B: book,C: park,D: current,E: lake, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the jellyfish was being moved by something in the water, and the word "pushed" indicates a force pushing the jellyfish.

The other options like "store," "book," "park," and "lake" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

--input-- Question: How can you help a person who is broke? Options: A: give something,B: cross street,C: lend money,D: trust god,E: feel sorry, Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is in need of financial assistance. Giving something or feeling sorry may not necessarily solve the problem, while crossing the street is irrelevant. Trusting God may be a personal belief but does not provide practical assistance.

Answer is
--target-- lend money

Options: A: tuna,B: eaten,C: rooster,D: cow,E: chopped, Knowledge: Roosters are necessary for hens to lay fertilized eggs, which can then hatch into chicks. If there is no rooster present, the hens will still lay unfertilized eggs, but they will not produce new chicks. Therefore, the presence of a rooster is important for sustained egg production. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and do not provide a logical answer. Answer is
--target-- rooster

Options: A: panic,B: debate,C: having fun,D: debt,E: peace, Knowledge: Going on vacation is often associated with taking a break from the routine of everyday life and engaging in enjoyable activities. While some people may experience stress while planning or travelling, "panic" and "debt" are generally not the main goals of a vacation. "Debate" may be applicable if a group is trying to decide on activities, but it is not a common goal of most individuals going on vacation. "Peace" may be a desirable outcome, but it does not necessarily capture the primary intention of going on vacation. Answer is
--target-- having fun

--input-- Question: What is a dangerous outdoor activity for children? Options: A: play games,B: wrong house,C: sun themselves,D: watch television,E: set table, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a dangerous outdoor activity for children.

Options: A: rest more,B: lazy,C: were sick,D: to be sick,E: you're sick, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is tired and sore, and has decided to stay in bed. The most logical reason for this is to rest and give his body time to recover. The choice "lazy" does not fit the context of the sentence, as the man is described as being tired and sore rather than simply choosing not to do anything. The choices "were sick," "to be sick," and "you're sick" all use improper grammar and are not suitable options. Answer is
--target-- rest more

Options: A: table,B: his bedroom,C: dishwasher,D: cabinet,E: restaurant, Knowledge: The question suggests that the son has finished eating and needs to put away his paper plate. The most logical place for him to put it would be on a table, which is a common surface for eating and clearing dishes.

Options: A: zoo,B: middle of road,C: dictionary,D: british columbia,E: countryside, Knowledge: Beavers are typically found in natural aquatic habitats, such as rivers, streams, and lakes, which are commonly found in rural and wilderness areas like the countryside. While it is possible for beavers to be found in a zoo, the context of the question suggests that it is asking about where beavers can be found in the wild. The other options (middle of road, dictionary) are not suitable habitats for beavers. British Columbia may be a possible answer, but it is not clear whether the question is asking for a specific location or a general type of environment. Answer is

Options: A: go into court,B: appear in court,C: go to church,D: in the jury,E: believe, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the judge is presiding over a court case and needs to listen to testimony from individuals who are involved in the case. "Appear in court" is a common phrase used to describe being present for a court case, whether as a witness or defendant.

Options: A: knell,B: kneel down,C: talk to god,D: talking to god,E: ask for help, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the faithful are engaging in an act of communication during their prayer, which is commonly associated with talking to god. Kneeling down may be a physical posture associated with prayer, but it does not necessarily imply communication with a deity. "Knell" is an uncommon verb that does not fit the context of the sentence, and "ask for help" is a possible motivation for prayer but does not describe the act itself. Therefore, "talking to god" is the most appropriate answer. Answer is
--target-- talking to god

Options: A: being satisfied,B: dirty dishes,C: bad breath,D: blue bus,E: gas, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children were in a rush to leave for school after eating breakfast.

Options: A: french fries,B: enjoy,C: nausea,D: satisfaction,E: gas, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was happy with his job, despite his appearance and the nature of his duties. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a positive emotion or feeling that is associated with job satisfaction. French fries and hamburgers are both types of fast food, but they do not necessarily indicate any emotional state. Enjoyment would be a possible answer, but there is no clear indication that the man enjoyed his job for any reason other than getting to eat hamburgers. Nausea and gas are both negative physical reactions that are unlikely to be associated with job satisfaction. Answer is
--target-- satisfaction

Options: A: street,B: sky,C: flashlight,D: books,E: hallway, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location for the light source should be within the home and specifically in a place where someone may trip. The most logical option is the hallway, which is a common pathway in a home and often has limited natural light sources. The other options, such as the street or sky, are located outside and not relevant to the context of the sentence. Flashlight and books could be a source of light, but not necessarily in the context of moving through one's home. Answer is
--target-- hallway
--input-- Question: What do you want to do to conquer opponent? Options: A: make fun of,B: win,C: total domination,D: best,E: compete, Knowledge: The word "conquer" suggests a sense of competition or battle, where one side must emerge victorious over the other. The option "win" directly relates to this idea of beating one's opponent and is the most logical choice. "Make fun of" is not a suitable option as it is not a strategy for defeating an opponent, and "best" and "compete" do not convey the same level of intensity as the word "conquer." "Total domination" is a possible option but is less commonly used and may not fit the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- win

Options: A: eternal,B: married life,C: religious,D: monastic,E: unpredictable, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was dissatisfied with the materialistic and consumerist aspects of secular life, indicating a desire for a simpler and more spiritual existence. This aligns with the concept of monastic life, which often involves living in a community and devoting oneself to prayer, meditation, and other spiritual practices while eschewing material possessions and worldly pursuits. The other options do not fit as neatly with the context of the sentence, such as "eternal," which is too abstract and unspecific, and "married life," which implies a different kind of lifestyle altogether. Answer is
--target-- monastic
--input-- Question: Knitting can cause what kind of illness in the hand? Options: A: your,B: have fun,C: shredded hands,D: arthritis,E: relaxation, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that knitting can cause some sort of illness or condition in the hands. Arthritis is a common condition that affects the joints, including those in the hands, and can be caused or worsened by repetitive movements such as those involved in knitting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and "have fun" and "relaxation" seem especially unlikely given that the sentence is discussing a potential negative outcome of the activity. "Shredded hands" may seem plausible given that knitting can be tough on the skin of the fingertips, but it is not a recognized medical condition. Answer is
--target-- arthritis

Options: A: yard,B: state park,C: market,D: orchard,E: surface of earth, Knowledge: An orchard is a place where trees are grown specifically for their fruit or nut production, whereas the other options do not necessarily have any association with providing food. A yard may have trees that bear fruit or nuts, but it is not their primary purpose, and not all yards have fruit trees. A state park may have trees that produce food, but it is not their primary purpose and they may not be accessible for harvesting. A market is a place to buy food, not grow it. The surface of the earth refers to the entire planet and has no specific association with trees that provide food. Answer is
--target-- orchard

Options: A: stapler,B: cupboard,C: desk drawer,D: office,E: pantry, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the food needs to be kept chilled but there is no refrigerator.

--target-- phone book
--input-- Question: Getting drunk often leads to what when people have disagreements? Options: A: violence,B: erections,C: illness,D: suffering,E: injury, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting drunk can lead to something negative when people have disagreements. While any of the answer choices may be negative on their own, the phrase "when people have disagreements" hints at a specific outcome. Research has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the likelihood of aggression and violent behavior, especially in the context of interpersonal conflicts. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "violence." The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are less commonly associated with the effects of alcohol consumption. Answer is

Options: A: open eyes,B: wear glasses,C: go to movies,D: have eyes,E: relax, Knowledge: In order to watch a film, one must have their eyes open to be able to see the images on the screen. The other options do not directly relate to the act of watching a film, for example, going to movies is an action taken to watch a film, but it does not describe what one must do on their face. Similarly, wearing glasses, having eyes, or relaxing may facilitate one's ability to watch a film, but they are not necessary actions to perform in order to watch a film. Answer is
--target-- open eyes
--input-- Question: Where do you keep instruments when you travel? Options: A: music shop,B: laboratory,C: case,D: operating room,E: shed, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to traveling with instruments, and the question is asking where the instruments are kept during such travel.

Options: A: gripping,B: briefcase,C: carry object,D: frying pan,E: coffee cup, Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is related to a visit to Starbucks, a popular coffee shop. The handle of a coffee cup is commonly held by people after they receive their coffee order, while the other options do not make sense in this context. "Gripping" could be a possible option, but it still doesn't fit the specific context of Starbucks. A "briefcase" or "frying pan" are unlikely options, as they are not typically associated with a visit to a coffee shop. "Carry object" is too vague and does not provide enough context to choose it as the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- coffee cup

Options: A: going to jail,B: punishment,C: recognizes their true oppressors,D: death of,E: dies, Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the question is related to the end of a war. The most likely outcome in a war is death, either through natural causes or from being killed in battle.

Recognizing their true oppressors may be a desirable outcome, but it does not necessarily mean the war will end. Answer is

Answer is
--target-- cherish

Options: A: school,B: notebook,C: book store,D: office,E: office supply store, Knowledge: A ring binder is a commonly used organizational tool for students, as it allows them to keep multiple sheets of paper in one place and separate them by subject or topic. Schools often require students to have ring binders as part of their school supplies. The other options, such as a notebook or bookstore, do not necessarily suggest that a student would have a ring binder. An office or office supply store may have ring binders, but it is not specific to students. Answer is
--target-- school

Options: A: headache,B: advance,C: gain knowledge,D: form opinions,E: elation, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone might feel a certain way after spending time learning about a subject they're passionate about. "Passionate" typically means having strong feelings, emotions, and enthusiasm towards something, so it's likely that the individual would feel positive about their learning experience. "Advance" and "gain knowledge" may also be correct as they could be seen as positive outcomes, but "headache" is unlikely and "form opinions" could be either positive or negative. Answer is
--target-- elation
--input-- Question: Where would there be a ticket office that has people with suitcases? Options: A: hotel,B: train station,C: opera house,D: end of line,E: city, Knowledge: The mention of people with suitcases suggests that the location is likely a transportation hub. A ticket office at a hotel or opera house would not necessarily have people with suitcases. "End of line" could refer to a transportation hub, but without further context, it is too vague to be a likely answer. "City" is too broad of a category to infer any useful information. Therefore, the most likely answer is "train station." Answer is
--target-- train station

Options: A: big city,B: chicago,C: large city,D: in the sky,E: new york city, Knowledge: The phrase "skyscrapers" refers to tall buildings, and New York City is known for having some of the most famous and iconic skyscrapers in the world, such as the Empire State Building and the One World Trade Center.

Options: A: relaxation,B: adventure,C: headache,D: deciding,E: revelations, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jane is experiencing physical and emotional discomfort and is in need of rest. Relaxation is the most appropriate choice as it addresses both her physical and emotional needs. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence.

Answer is

Options: A: attic,B: supermarket,C: farmer's market,D: refrigerator,E: cellar, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John is looking to satisfy his craving for carrots, which are commonly sold in supermarkets. The other options do not make sense in this situation - an attic or cellar would not typically have carrots, a farmer's market may not be open at 9 PM, and a refrigerator is typically found in one's own home, not a destination to drive to. Answer is
--target-- supermarket

Options: A: cheeks,B: parents,C: common sense,D: muscles,E: feelings, Knowledge: The question suggests that there is something that all people have, except for sociopaths. The word "except" implies that sociopaths lack this trait, while everyone else possesses it. The options "cheeks," "parents," "muscles," and "common sense" do not fit this pattern, as they are not traits that sociopaths are known to lack. However, sociopaths are often characterized as lacking or having difficulty understanding and experiencing emotions or feelings, so this is likely the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- feelings

Options: A: roof,B: tree,C: ground,D: forest,E: fall season, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally enjoys walking during autumn and specifically mentions her appreciation for the color of fallen leaves. The most logical place for her to take long walks in September that would allow her to see the changing colors of leaves would be a forest or wooded area.

--target-- forest
--input-- Question: While he had great disdain for the King and his knights he still respected their what? Options: A: reverence,B: respect,C: honor,D: admiration,E: kindness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker has negative feelings towards the King and his knights, but still holds them in high regard in some way. The choice "honor" would be the most fitting in this context because it implies that the speaker recognizes the importance or worthiness of the King and his knights, even if they do not necessarily like them. "Reverence," "admiration," and "respect" are also related to having positive or favorable feelings towards someone, which conflicts with the speaker's negative view in this sentence. "Kindness" does not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- honor
--input-- Question: Where do you use condoms? Options: A: supermarket,B: dick,C: bedroom,D: medicine chest,E: bed, Knowledge: Condoms are a form of contraceptive used during sexual activity to prevent pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections.

--target-- bedroom
--input-- Question: People using a machine gun are a part of what? Options: A: quake 2,B: arsenal,C: in a,D: armory,E: military service, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the use of a machine gun is associated with a specific field or profession. The options "quake 2" and "arsenal" are video game and weapon-related terms, respectively, and are not relevant to the context of the sentence. "In a" is too vague and does not provide any meaningful information. "Armory" is a location where weapons are stored, but it does not necessarily indicate the use of machine guns. "Military service" is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the use of weapons, including machine guns. Answer is
--target-- military service

Planting trees is a common activity for a landscape gardener, as they work to create a visually appealing and functional outdoor environment. Watering the lawn and plants is also important for maintaining the health and vibrancy of the outdoor space, but it is not necessarily a specific action that a landscape gardener is known for. Gardening roses is a specific type of activity that a gardener might engage in, but it is not necessarily what a landscape gardener is most commonly known for. Playing on the ground is not a task associated with any type of gardener. Answer is
--target-- plant trees
--input-- Question: If your trouser fly is unfastened what should you do? Options: A: do up,B: tie up,C: zip up,D: pick up,E: button up, Knowledge: The question refers to a common clothing item, trousers, and a specific part of it, the fly. The verb "unfastened" implies that the fly was previously closed, and therefore needs to be "fastened" or closed again. The options "do up," "tie up," and "button up" all suggest the use of buttons or ties to fasten the fly, but trousers typically have a zipper instead. Therefore, "zip up" is the correct answer. "Pick up" is not related to fastening clothing and doesn't make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- zip up
--input-- Question: The apple tree was located outside the car factory, it was one of many where? Options: A: maine,B: india,C: oregon,D: washington state,E: detroit, Knowledge: The sentence mentions a car factory, and Detroit is famously known as "Motor City" due to its history as a major center for automobile manufacturing.

The only logical option in this case is to flush the toilet, which is a common and necessary practice after using the restroom. The other options do not make sense in this context - "flushed" is in the past tense and the sentence is in the present tense, "refill" and "clear" do not fit with what someone would do in a bathroom and "smell bad" is not an action that anyone would take. Answer is
--target-- flush

Options: A: laughter,B: discomfort,C: glee,D: fun,E: inspiration, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the patient was recovering well but still had a long way to go, which suggests that they were experiencing some discomfort or pain. Additionally, the patient's explanation is in the context of chatting with friends, which makes it unlikely that they would be discussing glee, fun, or inspiration.

Options: A: seeing artifacts,B: shock,C: crowds,D: peace,E: being bored, Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the setting is a museum, which typically features exhibits of various types. Paintings are only one type of exhibit that can be found in a museum.

Options: A: arousal,B: disease,C: sweet,D: halatosis,E: cooties, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah believes boys have something negative or undesirable that makes them unworthy of being kissed. The option "cooties" is a common term used by children to refer to an imagined contagion or undesirable trait that is associated with the opposite gender.

The options of Japan and the United States are too broad, and the option of the desert does not make sense as a location for a steak house. Texas is known for its beef production and steak houses, but the more specific answer is that the steak house is the best in the town where the speaker comes from. Answer is

Answer is
--target-- lose money

Options: A: pain,B: small cuts,C: competition,D: injury,E: puncture wound, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that fencing is a sport, and like other sports, there is a risk of something. The options "pain" and "small cuts" may be common in sports, but they do not necessarily apply to fencing specifically. "Competition" is not a risk, but rather a component of the sport itself.

--target-- injury

Options: A: house,B: bar,C: pantry,D: supermarket,E: motherboard, Knowledge: The context suggests that the lady bought multiple bags of chips and had her kids stuff them on shelves, which implies that she is storing the chips at home. The most likely place to store food items such as chips at home would be the pantry. The other options do not make sense in this context - a bar would not typically have shelves for storing chips, supermarket staff would be responsible for restocking shelves, and a motherboard is unrelated to the situation.

Options: A: uncertainty,B: relax,C: satisfaction,D: compromises,E: finished, Knowledge: The term "tentative agreement" suggests that the individual has come to some sort of agreement, although it may not be final or completely solidified. Therefore, it's likely that the person would feel some sense of relief or satisfaction that progress has been made towards a resolution.

Answer is

Options: A: practise,B: relaxing,C: romantic,D: take lessons,E: tune, Knowledge: The sentence states that James loved to play violin in his spare time, implying that he did it for enjoyment and not as a formal practice or lesson. Additionally, the word "relaxing" suggests that playing the violin was a way for James to unwind and destress, which would not be the case if he found it difficult to tune or had to take lessons to improve. Therefore, "relaxing" is most likely the correct answer. Answer is

The fact that the city has many roads and a lot of traffic also implies that there might be a high level of pollution in the area due to emissions from vehicles. The other choices, such as happiness or death, have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Options: A: sleep,B: sit down,C: sit on chair,D: have rest,E: lie on floor, Knowledge: The term "fatigue" usually refers to a feeling of extreme tiredness or exhaustion, which suggests that the best course of action for someone experiencing this would be to rest their body as thoroughly as possible. While sitting down or having a rest might offer some respite, it is unlikely to be sufficient for someone who is experiencing full-body fatigue. Lying on the floor might be more restful than sitting, but it is still not the same as getting a full night's sleep. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is sleeping. Answer is
--target-- sleep

The options "understand," "able to hear," and "pay attention" are all related to the act of listening, but only "very quiet" directly addresses the need for a silent audience.

Options: A: being satisfied,B: heartburn,C: weight gain,D: overeating,E: gain energy, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is eating breakfast because they are hungry, which implies that their goal is to satisfy their hunger.

Movie theatres and circus tents are not typically used for classical music performances.

The countryside is a broad term that does not necessarily have a strong association with rocks. Answer is

Options: A: bathroom,B: cellar,C: countryside,D: restaurant,E: plate, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone is receiving cooked potatoes from an employee, which is a scenario that is likely to occur in a restaurant or food service establishment. The other options do not make sense in this context - the bathroom and cellar are unlikely places to receive food, and "plate" is not a location.

This suggests that John is in a store that primarily sells medication, such as a drugstore.

Answer is

Options: A: fun,B: keep score,C: try to win,D: attempt to win,E: bored, Knowledge: Playing games is generally considered a leisure activity that people engage in for enjoyment and entertainment.

The options "keep score," "try to win," and "attempt to win" are related to playing games, but are more specific reasons for playing certain types of games (e.g., competitive games) rather than the general rationale for playing games.

Options: A: swimming pool,B: lower person,C: boat,D: backpack,E: lay down, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is preparing for a hike and needs to know where to put the rope. The option "backpack" makes the most sense as it is a common place to store equipment while hiking. The other options, such as "swimming pool" and "boat," do not have any obvious connection to hiking and the option "lay down" doesn't make sense in terms of storing equipment. The option "lower person" is also unlikely as there is no context to suggest that someone else will be joining the hike. Answer is

The other options, such as fart, get lost, or go back, have no relevance to the context of the sentence.

This knowledge can help eliminate options like "ridiculous" and "happiness" which are not typically associated with this type of situation. The option "open sores" is completely unrelated to the context and can be eliminated. The remaining option, "different", does not provide enough information to determine whether it is correct or not, making "anxiety" the most likely correct answer. Answer is
--target-- anxiety
--input-- Question: What might someone get on a test that requires an answer? Options: A: swear,B: question,C: swear,D: wrong,E: problem, Knowledge: The question is asking about a test that requires an "answer," suggesting that the test involves responding to specific prompts or questions. "Swear" and "wrong" are not typically associated with test-taking, while "problem" is too vague to be a good answer choice. "Question" is the most logical choice, as it directly relates to the idea of answering prompts or queries. Answer is
--target-- question
--input-- Question: What would happen to a building if it is not needed any more? Options: A: cast shadow,B: fall down,C: target,D: weather storm,E: face north, Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of a building that is no longer needed. In general, if a building is not maintained or used, it will eventually deteriorate and collapse. This is because buildings are designed to withstand the weight and stresses of their intended use, and if they are left unoccupied and unmaintained, the structural integrity can be compromised. The other options do not make sense in this context - casting a shadow, facing north, or being a target are not necessarily related to a building's usefulness or condition, and weathering a storm could potentially damage a building, but it would not cause it to collapse entirely. Answer is
--target-- fall down

Options: A: happiness for,B: give up,C: acceptance,D: cultural revolution,E: new laws, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone wants to bring about change in their society, which requires some kind of action from their government. The option "new laws" is the most logical choice as laws are often used to regulate society and bring about change. "Happiness for" is not clear in its meaning and does not relate to the context of the sentence. "Give up" and "acceptance" do not suggest any proactive measures for bringing about change. "Cultural revolution" may bring about change, but it is not necessarily something that the government can provide. Answer is
--target-- new laws

Options: A: road,B: back yard,C: neighbor's house,D: porch,E: farmyard, Knowledge: When a pet goes missing, the first place to look for it is usually in the surrounding area of the owner's home. The most common location for pets to wander off to is the back yard or porch as it is a familiar environment for the pet. The other options, like the road or neighbor's house, may also be searched later on, but the back yard is usually the first place to begin the search. The option 'farmyard' may not apply if the owner has no access to one. Answer is
--target-- back yard
--input-- Question: If I am playing a xylophone with a large, amateur ensemble of young people, what am I a member of? Options: A: chef,B: abc book,C: high school band,D: orchestra,E: museum, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is a member of a musical ensemble, specifically one that includes young amateur musicians. The options "chef," "abc book," and "museum" do not fit this context at all. While "orchestra" is a type of ensemble, the fact that the sentence mentions a xylophone suggests that the group may be smaller and less formal than a full orchestra, making "high school band" the most likely choice. Answer is
--target-- high school band

Options: A: understood,B: being slapped,C: people will understand,D: pain,E: creation of art, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the method being referred to is a way of expressing oneself while also creating an object of lasting beauty. This is commonly associated with the creation of art, as art is often seen as a form of self-expression and can produce beautiful objects that endure over time. The other options, such as being slapped or experiencing pain, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not commonly associated with creating objects of beauty. Answer is
--target-- creation of art

--target-- sleeping
--input-- Question: What happens when someone is resting when they are tired? Options: A: time passes,B: fall asleep,C: going to sleep,D: lying down,E: snore, Knowledge: Resting when tired usually results in the individual falling asleep. This is because the body naturally tends to shut down and enter a state of sleep when it is tired in order to recuperate and rebuild energy.

Options: A: working,B: fix it,C: accelerate,D: putting together,E: breakdance, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the men had a lunch break, which implies that they were doing something before the break. The verb "resume" means to start again after a pause or interruption, so the correct answer must be an activity that was interrupted by the lunch break and then continued afterwards. Working is the most likely option, as it is a common activity that can be interrupted and resumed easily. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- working
--input-- Question: Where is a boat always supposed to be? Options: A: lake,B: harbor,C: sailing,D: water,E: ocean, Knowledge: A boat is a vessel designed to travel on water, so the correct answer must be a body of water. Harbors and lakes are specific locations where boats can be found, while sailing is the act of operating a boat on water. The ocean is a vast body of saltwater and is a type of water, but not all boats are meant to travel on the ocean. Therefore, the correct answer is water. Answer is
--target-- water

Answer is
--target-- old clock

The other options may also occur during such conversations, but they are not as directly related to the act of discussing current events with friends. Laughter may occur during any kind of social interaction, hope may be felt independently of conversation, feeling close to others may be a byproduct of any socializing, and social approval could be sought in a variety of contexts. Answer is
--target-- exchanging information

Options: A: do mathematics,B: read book,C: answer question,D: learn language,E: begin to study, Knowledge: The question is asking about how a foreign exchange student can navigate and communicate in a new country. Learning the language is a crucial step in achieving this, as it allows the student to communicate with locals, read signs and menus, and understand instructions.

Answer is

A rock concert would not be a traditional place for a rocking chair. An old folks home may have rocking chairs, but it is not necessarily a traditional place for them. A rocking chair in a child's room may be common, but it is not a traditional use of a rocking chair. Answer is
--target-- front porch
--input-- Question: Where could a jellyfish stay alive? Options: A: book,B: store,C: forest,D: lake,E: current, Knowledge: The question is referencing the habitat of a jellyfish, which typically lives in bodies of water such as oceans, seas, and lakes. The options "book" and "store" do not make sense in the context of the question, and "forest" is unlikely because jellyfish require water to survive. "Current" is also a valid option, as jellyfish can survive in ocean currents, but the question specifically asks for a location where they can stay alive, not just move around. Answer is
--target-- lake

The word "soccer" in the choice list indicates a strong possibility that this is what occurred, as soccer is a sport that is often played on grass and players often wear cleats.

--input-- Question: Where would you find a pet jellyfish? Options: A: australia,B: movie,C: japanese restaurant,D: shore,E: tank, Knowledge: The question suggests that the pet jellyfish is kept in a specific location, which rules out options like Australia, movie, and shore.

--target-- tank

The sentence also suggests that the children were enjoying themselves, which supports the idea that the activity was fun.

--target-- activity

--target-- fidelity

--input-- Question: The steak house was unfamiliar to western palettes, from where did the cooking style originate? Options: A: mexico,B: ocean,C: japan,D: texas,E: new york, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cooking style of the unfamiliar steak house is not commonly found in Western cuisine. The options "Mexico," "Texas," and "New York" are all locations within the Western hemisphere and therefore their cuisine would not be unfamiliar to Western palettes. The option "ocean" is not a location and does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, the cooking style is most likely from a location outside of the Western hemisphere, which narrows down the options to Japan. Japanese cuisine is known for its unique and distinct flavors, and therefore it is likely that the cooking style of the steak house originated from Japan. Answer is
--target-- japan
--input-- Question: What common area do most people keep a sofabed in? Options: A: one room apartment,B: livingroom,C: spare room,D: sitting room,E: in a bathroom, Knowledge: Sofabeds are commonly used as a space-saving solution for guests staying overnight. Most people don't have a spare room that can be dedicated solely to guests, so a sofabed is often kept in a shared living space, such as a livingroom or sitting room. A one room apartment may not have enough space to accommodate a sofabed, and it would be uncommon to keep a sofabed in a bathroom. Answer is
--target-- livingroom

Options: A: liquid,B: store,C: garage,D: pantry,E: gutter, Knowledge: The sentence mentions the word "oil," suggesting that the container can is used for automotive purposes.

--target-- garage

Options: A: startled,B: important,C: funny,D: shocked,E: laughter, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker usually doesn't like Adam Sandler, so the fact that they found his latest movie surprising must mean that it was different from his usual style. The fact that the speaker found it funny suggests that the movie was a comedy, which is a genre Sandler is well-known for. The other options do not provide any insight into why the speaker found the movie surprising. Answer is
--target-- funny

Options: A: linearity,B: have to wait for,C: long wait,D: anger,E: irritation, Knowledge: The sentence implies that James strongly disliked waiting in line, which suggests that the experience was unpleasant or frustrating for him. The word "hated" also indicates a strong negative emotional reaction, which rules out the options of linearity and have to wait for as being too neutral. The option of long wait might also be a possibility, but irritation more specifically captures a negative emotional state. The option of anger is also too extreme and does not necessarily fit with the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- irritation

Options: A: being able to use,B: know how to act,C: full capacity,D: solution to problem,E: gaining knowledge, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spending time finding information on operating something leads to a desired outcome or achievement. The most logical option would be "being able to use" since finding information on how to operate something would equip the person with the necessary knowledge to properly use the item. "Know how to act" could be a possibility, but it is not as directly related to operating something. "Full capacity" and "solution to problem" are also not directly related to operating something, while "gaining knowledge" is too broad and does not specifically address the purpose of finding information on operating something. Answer is
--target-- being able to use

Options: A: stupidity,B: detention,C: much work,D: boredom,E: trouble, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that misbehaving while attending school could result in some form of punishment that occurs after school hours. Detention is a common form of punishment for misbehavior, where a student is required to stay after school and complete additional work or remain in a designated area.

--target-- detention
--input-- Question: Why do people want to swim in the heat? Options: A: wear bathing suit,B: fun,C: excercise,D: cool down,E: exercise, Knowledge: The question is asking for the reason people want to swim in the heat, and the context indicates that the heat is uncomfortable. Therefore, the most likely reason people want to swim is to cool down. The other options - wearing a bathing suit, having fun, or exercising - could also be reasons people swim, but they do not directly address the issue of being hot and needing to cool down. Additionally, "exercise" is listed twice, but it is not necessarily a reason people want to swim in the heat. Answer is

--target-- rock
--input-- Question: What benefit can you get from watch tv? Options: A: have tv,B: distraction,C: learn,D: fall asleep,E: sitting, Knowledge: While watching TV can certainly provide a distraction or help someone fall asleep, the question specifically asks about a benefit one could gain. Watching TV can also provide an opportunity to learn new information or gain knowledge about a variety of topics, whether through educational programming or simply exposure to different perspectives and ideas. Therefore, the correct answer is "learn." The option "have TV" seems like it may be a possible benefit, but it is not a benefit FROM watching TV, but rather an access to watching TV. The option "sitting" may not be a benefit either, as it is not something that comes directly from watching TV, but rather a part of the experience of watching TV. Answer is
--target-- learn

The other options either do not describe North Carolina or do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- carolina
--input-- Question: What can happen to a dog wiggling during grooming? Options: A: injury,B: mistakes,C: late,D: pain,E: beauty, Knowledge: The word "wiggling" suggests that the dog is moving around during grooming, which can increase the likelihood of injury. Grooming involves the use of sharp tools and potentially hot water, so it's important for the dog to remain still. Mistakes, being late, and beauty are not directly related to the potential consequences of a dog wiggling during grooming. Pain may be a possible consequence, but injury is the most specific and likely outcome. Answer is
--target-- injury

--input-- Question: Where are small city halls usually located? Options: A: opera singers,B: detroit,C: court,D: towns,E: downtown area, Knowledge: The question is asking about the location of small city halls, which implies that they are not located in large cities like Detroit or in specific buildings like an opera house. The word "small" also suggests that these city halls are not located in busy commercial areas like downtown, but rather in smaller communities such as towns. The option "court" may seem plausible, but it does not fit the context of the question as it refers to a specific type of building rather than a general location. Answer is
--target-- towns

Options: A: countryside,B: parade,C: western movie,D: movies,E: rodeo, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the decoration of the horse is related to an event or spectacle it is participating in.

Options: A: having children,B: feeling good,C: overpopulation,D: exhaustion,E: reproduction, Knowledge: The question suggests that a long session of procreating may have negative consequences.

Options: A: haversack,B: desk,C: cabinet,D: backpack,E: house, Knowledge: Assuming that the individual will be traveling to another building, they will need to carry the scissors with them. Out of the given choices, a backpack is the most suitable option as it is portable and can easily be taken to another building.

Options: A: fights,B: competitiveness,C: having fun,D: getting tired,E: learning, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children had been playing for a while, which implies that they may start feeling exhausted. The option "getting tired" seems to be the most appropriate choice for this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Fights and competitiveness are not a natural outcome of playing, and learning is not mentioned in the sentence. Having fun might be a possible answer, but it does not capture the physical aspect suggested by the "playing" verb. Answer is
--target-- getting tired

Options: A: recorder,B: tape,C: i would write it on paper if possible..,D: documentation of facts,E: spell checker, Knowledge: The sentence implies that something needs to be recorded, which is typically done using a device known as a recorder. A recorder is designed to capture audio or video, making it a suitable option for recording lectures, meetings, or interviews. The other options, such as tape or documentation of facts, are less likely to be used in modern times due to advancements in technology. Writing on paper is also a valid option, but it may not be practical in all situations. A spell checker is a digital tool used to check spelling errors, which is not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is

"Big city" is a logical choice as train stations in large urban centers like New York, Tokyo, and London are likely to be the largest ones. The other options, such as an ocean or the downtown area, do not make sense in the context of train stations. Answer is
--target-- big city

--input-- Question: Hammers are made of metal and what other item? Options: A: softness,B: plastic,C: stone,D: wooden,E: toolbox, Knowledge: Hammers are traditionally made with a metal head and a wooden handle. The wooden handle provides a comfortable grip for the user and helps to absorb the shock of the striking force.

Options: A: schizophrenia,B: deception,C: live in poverty,D: bad feelings,E: wealth, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is unable to afford their home, which implies that they are facing financial difficulties. Living in poverty is a common reason for being unable to afford a home, and is therefore the most likely answer.

Wealth is the opposite of living in poverty, and is therefore not a viable answer. Answer is
--target-- live in poverty
--input-- Question: My friend makes a living playing trumpet, where might he work? Options: A: music shop,B: brass band,C: horn,D: high school band,E: orchestra, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the friend is a professional musician who earns a living playing trumpet. Among the choices, an orchestra is the most likely place for a professional trumpet player to work as it typically has a full range of brass instruments, including trumpets, and performs a wide variety of music genres. A music shop is unlikely to provide enough income for a professional musician, and a brass band or high school band may not have enough budget to hire a full-time trumpeter. Answer is
--target-- orchestra

"Will have to wait" suggests acceptance of the situation, "daydreaming" indicates a distraction from the situation, and "angry" implies a stronger emotional reaction than just impatience. Answer is
--target-- impatience

The option "older generation" best fits this context, as the uncle is likely the eldest in his family and is therefore the closest living connection to the older generation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The correct spelling of "aunt's house" should also be noted, as it is incorrect in one of the options. Answer is
--target-- older generation

Options: A: dry mouth,B: whispering,C: being heard,D: eye contact,E: not listening, Knowledge: The sentence implies that talking to someone would be pointless if they are not paying attention or actively listening.

--input-- Question: What could stop someone from staying healthy? Options: A: live long,B: sadness,C: injury,D: long life,E: happiness, Knowledge: The question is asking for something that could prevent someone from staying healthy, which suggests a negative factor. Options like "live long" and "happiness" are positive factors and don't fit the context of the question. "Sadness" could contribute to poor mental health, but not necessarily physical health. "Long life" is not an obstacle to staying healthy, but rather a desired outcome. "Injury," on the other hand, is a clear factor that could prevent someone from maintaining good physical health. It could lead to restricted movement, chronic pain, and other health complications. Therefore, "injury" is the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- injury

Options: A: calluses,B: playing wrong note,C: audition,D: making music,E: read music, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person playing the violin is doing so in the hopes of recording their music. This suggests that the person is interested in creating music, rather than simply practicing or performing for fun. Therefore, the correct answer is "making music". The other options, such as "calluses" and "playing wrong note", are not related to the goal of wanting to record music, and "audition" and "read music" could be related, but do not match the specific context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- making music

Options: A: wedding,B: fraternity house,C: friend's house,D: school,E: bar, Knowledge: The word "sorority" suggests that the two friends are part of a female Greek organization on a college campus. In this context, it is likely that the "fraternity house" option is the correct answer as it is a common location for college parties and drinking. The other options do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence, as a wedding, friend's house, and school are not typically associated with Greek life partying. While a bar could be a possibility, the mention of a fraternity house suggests a more specific location. Answer is
--target-- fraternity house
--input-- Question: What does a birthday do to someone? Options: A: regret,B: indoor plumbing,C: feel special,D: own house,E: electricity, Knowledge: Birthdays are typically associated with celebrations and making someone feel special.

Options: A: drawer,B: desk,C: briefcase,D: medium,E: office supply store, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the business man had a meeting that required him to bring a fancy leather item with him (most likely for a professional appearance). The fact that his small child got marker on it implies that it was something that could easily be accessed by a child, which rules out options such as a drawer or desk. Of the remaining options, "briefcase" is the most commonly associated with a professional meeting setting. "Medium" and "office supply store" do not make any sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- briefcase
--input-- Question: Where would you get a radio if you do not have one? Options: A: school,B: space shuttle,C: trunk,D: stalk,E: shop, Knowledge: The options "school," "space shuttle," "trunk," and "stalk" are not logical places to obtain a radio.

Options: A: clothing stores,B: scotland,C: eddie bauer,D: fabric store,E: online, Knowledge: The sentence specifies that the person is looking to make clothing out of tweed, which is a type of fabric. Therefore, it makes sense to look for a fabric store where they sell a variety of fabrics, including tweed. The other options, such as clothing stores or Eddie Bauer, may sell clothing made out of tweed, but they may not have the specific fabric available for purchase. Additionally, buying online may be an option, but it may be harder to confirm the quality and texture of the fabric without seeing it in person. Answer is

Answer is
--target-- church

Options: A: happiness,B: punishment,C: anger,D: tears,E: suffering, Knowledge: Anger is often associated with negative consequences, such as causing harm to others either verbally or physically. Expressing anger can lead to arguments or fights, hurting relationships with others, and ultimately causing pain to both the person expressing their anger and the people they interact with. On the other hand, the other choices such as happiness, tears, and suffering are not inherently harmful to others. Punishment may cause harm, but it is not an emotion. Answer is

--input-- Question: When taking a long walk, where would you store your clothing? Options: A: suitcase,B: department store,C: purse,D: mall,E: backpack, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is taking a long walk, which implies an outdoor activity. A suitcase or department store would be too cumbersome to bring on a walk, and a mall is not a place to store clothing during a walk. A purse is too small to store clothing.

The word "gratifying" implies a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment, which matches the idea of making bread. The options "pride" and "adept" suggest a level of skill or mastery, but do not necessarily relate to the enjoyment of making bread. "Mess" and "allergic reactions" have negative connotations and do not fit with the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- gratifying
--input-- Question: What will an athlete do to warm up their legs? Options: A: use heater,B: sprint,C: jog,D: run fast,E: compete, Knowledge: Warming up before exercise is important in order to prevent injury and improve performance. Jogging is a common warm-up exercise for athletes because it increases blood flow, raises the body temperature, and prepares the muscles for more intense activity. Sprinting, running fast, and competing are all more intense exercises that would come after warming up. Using a heater is not a common way for athletes to warm up their legs. Answer is

Options: A: eat whales for breakfast,B: listen to music,C: have friends,D: hug,E: eat trash, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action being described is commonly associated with relaxation. Eating whales for breakfast and eating trash do not make logical sense and are not commonly associated with relaxation. Having friends and hugging may be enjoyable activities, but they do not necessarily imply relaxation. In contrast, listening to music is a common activity associated with relaxation because it can help to slow the heart rate, reduce stress, and promote a sense of calm. Answer is
--target-- listen to music

Options: A: straightforth,B: reverse,C: backwards,D: back and,E: race, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Gill was driving a car and needed to go back for something he forgot. Putting the car in reverse would allow him to back up and return to the previous location, while the other options do not make as much sense in this context. "Backwards" and "back and" are similar to "reverse" but are not specific to driving a car. "Straightforth" and "race" do not make any sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- reverse

It is traditionally worn during prayer, Torah study, and other religious rituals. The other options in the choices (demonstration, concert, garage, bus stop) are not typically associated with religious practices or customs, so they can be eliminated as potential answers. This leaves the option of synagogue as the logical choice, as it is a place of worship for Jews where a yarmulke would be appropriate to wear. Answer is
--target-- synagogue

The phrase "fiddling while" implies that Suzan is playing music, while the others are engaged in a more physical activity. The phrase "wild fun" suggests that they are not doing a traditional dance like square dancing, but rather moving about in a less orderly way. "Shuffle," "troubles," and "discovery" do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- dancing about
--input-- Question: Where is a front yard likely to be small? Options: A: suburb,B: gardening,C: slip and slides,D: grass,E: neighborhood, Knowledge: Front yards are usually small in suburban areas because houses are typically built closer together in suburban neighborhoods than in rural areas, which means less space for front yards.

Options: A: frustration,B: working hard,C: over time,D: stress,E: employment, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is applying for a job and making a promise to the manager. Promising to work hard is a common expectation for job interviews, as it shows the applicant's dedication and commitment to the job. The other options, such as frustration or stress, do not make sense in the context of a job interview. Overtime may be expected in certain jobs, but it would not be a promise made during an interview. Employment is also not a promise as it is the goal of the job application process. Answer is
--target-- working hard
--input-- Question: What could happen to you if you are cleaning house for only a short time? Options: A: exhaustion,B: tiredness,C: sneezing,D: order,E: make money, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence associated with cleaning house for only a short time. The option "exhaustion" and "tiredness" may seem plausible, but the sentence does not provide any evidence to support these choices. However, the sentence specifically mentions "sneezing," which could be a result of stirring up dust or allergens during cleaning. Therefore, "sneezing" is the most appropriate choice. The option "order" and "make money" are not supported by the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- sneezing

--input-- Question: What do children often do before bed? Options: A: play games,B: push ups,C: play with toys,D: hear stories,E: throw things, Knowledge: The question is asking about a common bedtime routine for children. Hearing stories before bed is a widely recognized tradition that many parents use to help their children relax and prepare for sleep.

Options: A: wall in,B: grow tall,C: fire,D: covered in snow,E: burn, Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a danger to the trees due to the drought.

Options: A: form images,B: tended,C: hatred,D: play tricks on,E: form thought, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was able to mentally create or visualize things that he wanted, which is commonly associated with forming images in one's mind. The phrase "play tricks on" and the word "hatred" have negative connotations and do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The word "tended" does not fit grammatically and "form thought" is a less likely choice compared to "form images" due to the specific mention of visualization or imagination in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- form images
--input-- Question: Jimmy and Tim like playing together.  When they play for a long time they have to stop because they do what? Options: A: feeling happy,B: get hungry,C: learning,D: grow up,E: injury, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when Jimmy and Tim play for a long time, they eventually have to stop because of a physical need- hunger. Learning and growing up are not physical needs that would cause them to stop playing, and injury seems unlikely since it is not mentioned in the sentence. Feeling happy is also not a clear reason for them to stop playing, as happiness would not impede their ability to continue playing. Answer is
--target-- get hungry

Options: A: anything,B: everywhere,C: judge men,D: give peace,E: help people, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a rule or guideline that members of the flock should be following, but many forget it.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- judge men

Options: A: bowling alley,B: soccer field,C: sporting event,D: sporting goods store,E: cuddle, Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is looking to acquire a ball, which is a piece of sporting equipment. Therefore, the most likely option for obtaining a ball would be a sporting goods store, which is a retail establishment that specializes in selling sporting equipment. The other options may be places where balls are commonly used or found, but they do not necessarily provide a means for obtaining one. Cuddle is not a relevant option as it has no connection to the context of the question. Answer is

--input-- Question: How do most people communicate? Options: A: dance together,B: speak words,C: fight,D: own cars,E: believe in god, Knowledge: Speaking words is the most common form of communication amongst humans. This is because verbal communication allows individuals to exchange information and ideas with one another in a relatively efficient and precise manner. While dancing together and fighting can be forms of non-verbal communication, they are not as widely used as speaking words. Owning cars and believing in god are not related to the question of how people communicate. Answer is

--input-- Question: What can sitting in a room, waiting for an appointment lead to? Options: A: impatience,B: have fun,C: boredom,D: giving birth to frogs,E: wisdom, Knowledge: The sentence implies that waiting for an appointment can lead to a negative emotion, and the word "boredom" is commonly associated with waiting in a situation where nothing is happening.

Answer is
--target-- boredom

Options: A: power mower,B: boat,C: refineries,D: gas station,E: oil rig, Knowledge: Gasoline is typically sold at gas stations, which are specifically designed to supply fuel to cars, trucks, and other vehicles. Power mowers and boats may use gasoline as a fuel source, but they would need to purchase it from a gas station (or other retailer) in order to obtain it. Refineries and oil rigs are production facilities that are involved in the extraction and processing of crude oil, but they are not typically associated with the retail sale of gasoline to end-users. Answer is
--target-- gas station

Options: A: train,B: tropical seas,C: weather report,D: america,E: caribbean, Knowledge: The sentence implies that meteorologists did not predict or forecast the storm, as it came as a surprise. The weather report is the document or broadcast where meteorologists communicate their predictions and warnings, so it is logical to assume that they did not mention the storm in the report. The other options do not provide any logical connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- weather report

Options: A: that you,B: walking,C: stress,D: spending money,E: relax, Knowledge: The act of selling a house can be a stressful experience for many homeowners as it involves numerous tasks such as preparing the home for sale, marketing the property, and negotiating with potential buyers.

Answer is
--target-- stress
--input-- Question: What does a baby do before it can talk? Options: A: boy or girl,B: learn to speak,C: talk nonsense,D: begin to talk,E: ride the bike, Knowledge: The question is asking about a developmental milestone that happens prior to a baby being able to talk. While the choices "boy or girl" and "ride a bike" are not relevant to the question, the other choices allow for some analysis. "Talk nonsense" and "begin to talk" both suggest that the baby is starting to speak, which is not what the question is asking. Therefore, "learn to speak" is the best answer, as it describes the stage prior to the baby being able to talk in a meaningful way. Answer is
--target-- learn to speak

Options: A: hall,B: kitchen,C: neighbor's house,D: card room,E: livingroom, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the host needed an extra table to accommodate all the guests, which indicates that the main dining area was not enough.

--target-- livingroom

Chess is a game that can be played outside, and parks are a common location for people to gather and play games.

A pool or cabinet do not seem like appropriate locations for playing chess. Answer is

In this context, it is likely that the correct answer is "truthful," as taking an oath typically implies a commitment to honesty and integrity. The other choices, such as "not fib" and "not lie," are synonyms for "truthful," but they are not as formal or specific to the context of taking an oath. The options "sense of duty" and "think" are not related to the concept of taking an oath. Answer is

Options: A: produce food,B: raise crops,C: can produce,D: grow corn,E: plant seeds, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject of discussion is what a farmer does.

In most cultures, marriage is the formalization of a committed relationship, and the other options do not fit the context of the question.

'Set table' and 'gather flowers' are activities that may or may not be related to child development, but they do not specifically relate to the stage of development the question is referring to.

--input-- Question: Where is required to have a single fire extinguisher? Options: A: house,B: boat,C: washroom,D: stairwell,E: hospital, Knowledge: The question is asking where it is required to have a single fire extinguisher, which implies that there may be specific regulations or laws governing this requirement. A common regulation is that all boats must have at least one fire extinguisher on board. This is because boats have a higher risk of fire due to the presence of flammable materials such as fuel, oil, and propane, as well as the limited ability to escape a fire on a vessel. The other options may also require fire extinguishers, but there is no clear indication of a specific requirement for a single extinguisher in those locations. Answer is

Options: A: map,B: device,C: area,D: almost anywhere,E: location, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the place in question is unique and perhaps even secluded or off the beaten path.

The phrase "what for dinner" implies that the animal is figuring out how to get their meal. The option "buffalo" is a herbivore, so they wouldn't have sharp teeth to catch prey. "Fight for life" and "leave home" are not related to the idea of finding food. "Eating" is not a behavior or action, but rather a result of the animal's actions. Answer is
--target-- hunt for food

Options: A: bedsores,B: lay down,C: bed sores,D: sleep in,E: open the curtain, Knowledge: The question is asking for the first thing someone does before planning to stay in bed, which suggests they are preparing for sleep or rest. Therefore, the correct option is likely to involve the act of getting into bed. Of the choices provided, "lay down" is the option that best fits this criteria.

Options: A: supermarket,B: toilet,C: pantry,D: bar,E: motherboard, Knowledge: Potato chips are a common snack food item that people often keep in their homes. Storing them in a supermarket or bar would not make sense, as these types of places are intended for commercial purposes.

Additionally, historical documents often mention feathers being used for writing, further supporting the idea that feathers were commonly used for this purpose.

Canada is also home to bald eagles, but the sentence specifically mentions a floating bridge, which may be less common in Canada. Answer is

--input-- Question: Where always has a large amount of trash that only grows? Options: A: dumpster,B: detroit,C: garbage dump,D: state park,E: subway, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being described is a place where a lot of trash accumulates and continues to increase over time. A garbage dump is a common location for this, as it is where waste is disposed of and can pile up over time.

Options: A: stage,B: demonstration,C: record sound,D: parade,E: conference, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the engineer is presenting a new invention to his bosses, and turning on the microphone indicates that he is preparing to give a speech or presentation. The option "demonstration" is the most appropriate because it reflects the action of showing how the invention works, which is the expected activity in this scenario. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are not commonly associated with presenting something new or demonstrating how it works. Answer is

Options: A: wait turn,B: pay,C: frustration,D: pain,E: order, Knowledge: When you're standing in line for food, the natural next step would be placing your order. "Wait turn" is too generic as it doesn't specify what you're waiting to do, and "pay" would come after you order. "Frustration" and "pain" are not actions, and don't make sense as answers to this question. Answer is
--target-- order
--input-- Question: Bobby had a toothache so he went to the closet dentist office, which was in a strange place.  Where might it be? Options: A: town,B: office building,C: patient,D: medical center,E: candy shop, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dentist's office is located in an unconventional or unexpected place, which makes the option "candy shop" less likely since dental offices are not commonly found in candy shops. "Medical center" is a reasonable option, but the sentence specifies that the office is in a "strange place," which does not necessarily describe a typical medical center. "Town" and "patient" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, the most plausible option is "office building," as many dental practices are located within larger commercial or professional buildings. Answer is
--target-- office building
--input-- Question: The company didn't have any local stores.  How did they sell things? Options: A: ship goods,B: mail order,C: own resources,D: peddled,E: branch out, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the company did not have physical stores in the area, indicating that they likely used other methods of selling. The most logical choice is mail order, as it allows companies to sell products without needing a physical storefront. Shipping goods and peddling may require some sort of physical presence in the area, and owning resources and branching out do not seem to make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- mail order

Therefore, John was relieved because he didn't make a mistake after all. The word "mistake" and the phrase "picked A by accident" indicate that John did not intend to choose A. The option "correct answer" is the most logical since John was relieved to learn that A was indeed the correct answer. The other options do not make sense in the given context. Answer is
--target-- correct answer

While it's possible to learn on your own in your living room or a music room, those options do not imply a structured curriculum with trained instructors.

Options: A: problems,B: writing down,C: being prepared,D: phoning,E: panicking, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe needed to communicate something important to Marsha before she left home, but he forgot to do so. He then spent an hour "desperately" doing something, which suggests that he was under pressure to get in touch with her. Phoning would be a logical option in this scenario, as it would allow Joe to reach Marsha quickly and convey the important information to her. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- phoning
--input-- Question: He likes to keep all his equipment out back in it, so where is his saw? Options: A: garage,B: tool kit,C: toolbox,D: tool shed,E: hardware store, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question keeps all their equipment in a specific place, which is likely to be a storage area. The options "garage" and "hardware store" don't fit the context of the sentence, as they are not typically places where someone would store their personal equipment. "Tool kit" and "toolbox" suggest that the saw would be in a portable container, but the sentence specifically mentions an outdoor location, so "tool shed" is the most appropriate option. Answer is
--target-- tool shed
--input-- Question: When someone does not want something, they are said to do what to it? Options: A: reject,B: annoy,C: refuse,D: stockpile,E: detest, Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone is expressing a negative attitude towards something they don't want. "Reject" and "detest" also convey negative attitudes, but "reject" suggests a more active action, like denying or turning away, while "detest" suggests a strong, emotional dislike. "Annoy" does not fit the sentence's context of expressing a negative attitude towards something, and "stockpile" is unrelated. "Refuse" is the most appropriate choice as it conveys a passive action of not accepting or declining something. Answer is
--target-- refuse

A neighborhood is a community of people who live in a particular area, which may or may not have yards. A file is a collection of documents or data stored on a computer. A city is a large urban area with its own government and infrastructure, which may contain many properties with yards but is not typically considered a part of a property in the same way that a yard is.

Options: A: subways,B: desert,C: mexico,D: atlas,E: developed land, Knowledge: The question is asking for a term that describes areas that are located near highways and have been built up with infrastructure and buildings.

--target-- developed land
--input-- Question: A material that is elastic is able to do what? Options: A: rebound,B: underwear,C: recoil,D: stretch,E: bounce, Knowledge: The word "elastic" implies that the material has the ability to stretch and then return to its original shape. The other choices, such as "rebound," "recoil," and "bounce," also imply movement or a return to a previous state, but do not necessarily indicate the ability to stretch. "Underwear" is a type of clothing and is not related to the properties of elasticity. Answer is
--target-- stretch

Options: A: street,B: sewer,C: landfile will not use for garbage,D: landfile,E: garbage dump, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the garbage men are not properly disposing of the garbage and that it is ending up somewhere it should not be. The most logical answer to this would be on the street, as it is a common place where garbage can accumulate when not properly collected. The sewer and landfill options do not make sense as the sentence suggests the garbage is not being properly disposed of, while the other two options are essentially the same thing as a landfill. Answer is
--target-- street

Options: A: restrict freedom,B: showing mercy,C: send to room,D: deny,E: put in jail, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teacher is punishing the student by not allowing them to go to recess. The word "punish" and the phrase "not allowing them to go to recess" indicate that the teacher is taking away a privilege. The word "deny" means to refuse to grant or allow something, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the action of the teacher in this situation. Answer is
--target-- deny
--input-- Question: Where is the best place to get a bicycle for a child? Options: A: toy store,B: fun,C: street,D: university,E: garage, Knowledge: The question asks about the best place to get a bicycle for a child, which implies that the focus is on finding a bike that is suitable and safe for a child.

--target-- toy store

Options: A: having fun,B: new contacts,C: meet new people,D: making new friends,E: doing drugs, Knowledge: The phrase "held at work" suggests that the party is related to the work environment, which implies that attending the party may be an opportunity to make new contacts or network with colleagues. While it's possible to have fun and make new friends at the party, the primary goal in a work-related setting would likely be to establish professional connections. The option of doing drugs is inappropriate and unrelated to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- new contacts
--input-- Question: If a man needs a shave he'd go to the bathroom, then maybe get the disposable razor out of where? Options: A: medicine cabinet,B: travel bag,C: supermarket,D: closet,E: garbage, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is likely in his own home when he needs to shave, which would make the medicine cabinet the most likely place for him to keep his disposable razor.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- medicine cabinet

Options: A: travel new places,B: learn new,C: learn to read,D: enjoyable,E: bored, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the individual enjoys reading and has likely read a lot. Since the options are related to the context, "learn new" is the most appropriate choice. "Travel new places" may be tempting, but it does not necessarily follow from the fact that the individual likes reading books. Similarly, "learn to read" does not make sense in this context, and "enjoyable" and "bored" are adjectives that do not relate to the sentence in any meaningful way. Answer is
--target-- learn new
--input-- Question: Why does this person stop and look both ways at a railroad crossing? Options: A: gain weight,B: promise to do,C: fear death,D: cross street,E: laws, Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the person is at a railroad crossing.

--target-- fear death
--input-- Question: Where are cars likely to move quickly? Options: A: car dealership,B: car show,C: superb,D: parking lot,E: freeway, Knowledge: Freeways are designed to accommodate high speeds and are often the fastest way to travel on roads. Car dealerships and car shows are locations where cars are displayed, not driven, and therefore speed is not a factor. "Superb" is not a location and is not related to driving speeds. Parking lots are typically limited in speed due to pedestrian traffic and safety concerns. Answer is
--target-- freeway

Options: A: library,B: post office,C: university,D: technical store,E: large city, Knowledge: Super computers are advanced computing machines that are typically used for scientific research, simulation, and data analysis. While they may be used in various settings, universities are a common place to find them due to the research and academic needs of faculty and students. Libraries and post offices do not typically have super computers, and while technical stores may sell technology products, they may not necessarily have super computers readily available. Large cities are also not necessarily a common place to find super computers. Answer is
--target-- university
--input-- Question: What are birds likely to do in the winter? Options: A: learn to fly,B: spread wings,C: fly north,D: fly high,E: head south, Knowledge: Many bird species migrate to warmer climates during the winter to avoid harsh weather conditions and to find sources of food. The phrase "head south" suggests that the birds are likely to fly in a southerly direction during this time. The other options do not fit the context of the question, as it is already assumed that the birds are capable of flying and spreading their wings. Learning to fly is something that birds do as fledglings, not as adults. Flying north may be appropriate for some species during the spring and summer months, but it would not make sense for them to do so during the winter when temperatures are cold. Flying high may be an option for some birds, but it is not a necessary or distinguishing behavior for winter migration. Answer is
--target-- head south
--input-- Question: What is procreating too much likely to lead to? Options: A: having children,B: feeling good,C: food shortage,D: exhaustion,E: overpopulation, Knowledge: The phrase "procreating too much" suggests that the question is about the potential negative consequences of having too many children.

The other options do not directly address the issue of overpopulation. Answer is
--target-- overpopulation

Based on common knowledge and experiences, it is likely that what the traffic caused Sarah was stress, as traffic can be frustrating, time-consuming, and can lead to anxiety and agitation. The other options, such as car crashes, death, and happiness, are not likely to be connected to the sentence, as they are not related to Sarah's dislike of driving and the traffic. Answer is
--target-- stress

Options: A: eat,B: wash legs,C: wash hands,D: zip pants,E: flush toilet, Knowledge: It is important to wash your hands after using the bathroom, especially after urinating, to prevent the spread of germs and bacteria to yourself and others.

Eating should come after washing your hands to ensure you do not transfer any germs from your hands to your food. Answer is
--target-- wash hands

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is

Options: A: meditation,B: nothing,C: confused,D: epilepsy,E: meditate, Knowledge: Going into a trance is often associated with meditation, where the person intentionally enters a deep state of relaxation to achieve certain benefits such as stress reduction, heightened awareness, and spiritual connection.

Options: A: sit comfortably,B: think about things,C: might understand,D: enjoy,E: brain work, Knowledge: The word "cogitating" is derived from the Latin word "cogitare" which means "to think" or "to ponder." Thus, the correct answer is likely to be an option that indicates a process of thinking or contemplating. "Sit comfortably" and "enjoy" do not accurately describe the act of thinking. "Might understand" may suggest a possibility of comprehension but not necessarily the act of thinking. "Brain work" is close in meaning but not as precise as "think about things," which better captures the meaning of cogitating. Answer is
--target-- think about things

Options: A: you die,B: obesity,C: feeling satisfied,D: feel full,E: digestion, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having lunch too many times can result in a negative outcome. Since feeling full and feeling satisfied are both normal outcomes after having lunch, they can be ruled out. Also, dying is an extreme outcome that is unlikely to happen just from having lunch too many times. Digestion is a normal process after having food, so it cannot be the answer. Obesity, however, is a well-known health concern that can arise from consuming an excessive amount of food, including lunch. Answer is

--input-- Question: Where would you find a gun along with people in uniform training for war? Options: A: crime scene,B: backyard,C: police station,D: military base,E: police car, Knowledge: The sentence mentions people in uniform training for war, which implies some sort of military training. Guns are commonly used in military training, so it makes sense that a gun would be present in this context. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a crime scene would likely involve detectives rather than people training for war, a backyard is unlikely to have people in uniforms training for war, a police station would have officers training for law enforcement rather than war, and a police car would not be a suitable location for military training. Answer is
--target-- military base
--input-- Question: Why would someone be committing suicide? Options: A: being dead,B: misery,C: kill yourself,D: loss of someone,E: scars, Knowledge: Suicide is often a result of severe emotional pain, commonly referred to as "misery." Other factors, such as the loss of someone or physical scars, may contribute to a person's emotional state, but they alone are not typically the sole cause of suicide. Additionally, the phrasing "kill yourself" is a problematic term that can contribute to stigma and should be avoided. The correct answer is the more appropriate and sensitive term for the underlying cause of suicide. Answer is
--target-- misery
--input-- Question: What can drinking alcohol in excess to the point of poisoning cause? Options: A: death,B: disorientation,C: frequent urination,D: having sex,E: bad breath, Knowledge: Drinking alcohol in excess to the point of poisoning can cause severe harm to the body, including death. Alcohol poisoning can cause respiratory depression, seizures, and a dangerous drop in blood sugar levels. Disorientation and frequent urination are also common symptoms of alcohol poisoning, but they are not as severe as the risk of death. Having sex and bad breath do not have any clear connection to alcohol poisoning. Answer is
--target-- death
--input-- Question: What helps a human to move? Options: A: two arms,B: drinks,C: stupidity,D: one body,E: muscles, Knowledge: The question is asking about what helps a human to move, and muscles are the primary body part responsible for movement. Humans have over 600 muscles in their body which work together to enable us to walk, run, jump, and perform other physical activities. The other options - two arms, drinks, stupidity, and one body - do not directly relate to the question or provide a plausible answer. Answer is
--target-- muscles
--input-- Question: What could prevent you from doing housework that involves dust? Options: A: fatigue,B: maid,C: headache,D: arguments,E: asthma, Knowledge: The question is asking for something that could specifically prevent someone from doing housework that involves dust. Asthma is a respiratory condition that can be triggered by dust and can cause difficulty breathing, coughing, and wheezing. Fatigue, headache, and arguments are all potential reasons why someone may not want to do housework, but they do not directly relate to the presence of dust. A maid could certainly help with housework, but they are not a preventive factor in this scenario. Answer is
--target-- asthma
--input-- Question: A person needs to breathe to survive, but they also need what two things to thrive? Options: A: freedom of expression,B: freedom of information,C: hugs,D: own house,E: food and water, Knowledge: The sentence is discussing the basic needs of a person for survival and thriving. While breathing is necessary for survival, the sentence suggests that there are two additional things that are required for a person to thrive. The options "freedom of expression" and "freedom of information" are not basic needs for survival, and while hugs and owning a house may contribute to a person's well-being, they are not necessary for basic survival. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "food and water," which are basic necessities for the human body to function and thrive. Answer is
--target-- food and water
--input-- Question: If you're on the terrace enjoying warm Mediterranean breezes in what part of the continent are you? Options: A: garden,B: spain,C: rice paddy,D: house,E: southern europe, Knowledge: The sentence mentions "Mediterranean breezes," which refers to a warm climate and a specific body of water called the Mediterranean sea. Southern Europe is known for having numerous countries located along the Mediterranean coast, such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. None of the other answer options relate to this context. Answer is
--target-- southern europe
--input-- Question: Where would you get a stepladder if you do not have one? Options: A: hardware store,B: store room,C: garage,D: construction worker's vehicle,E: tool shed, Knowledge: A stepladder is a commonly used tool for reaching high places or accessing items that are out of reach. It is a type of ladder that has a platform for standing on and two or more steps or rungs. The most likely place to find a stepladder if you do not have one would be a hardware store, as they typically carry a wide variety of tools and equipment for home improvement and maintenance. The other options may also have ladders available, but they are less likely to have a specific stepladder designed for household use. Answer is
--target-- hardware store
--input-- Question: Sally wanted to buy a house close to a city, but not too far away.  Where did Sally look for a home? Options: A: residential area,B: suburbs,C: outskirts of city,D: surface of earth,E: street, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally was looking for a home that was close to the city, but not too far away. The suburbs are typically residential areas located on the outskirts of a city, which would make them a likely option for Sally's search. The other options do not have any clear connection to Sally's desire for a home close to a city. Answer is
--target-- suburbs
--input-- Question: If you're going on vacation and you leave your tickets at home what might you experience when you get to the airport? Options: A: debt,B: peace,C: panic,D: laugh,E: having fun, Knowledge: Forgetting your tickets when going on vacation is likely to cause anxiety and stress, as it may prevent you from being able to travel as planned. Panic is a common reaction to such situations, as individuals may feel helpless and unsure of what to do next. Debt, peace, laugh, and having fun do not seem relevant to this scenario. Answer is
--target-- panic
--input-- Question: Where is  a state highway likely to be crowded? Options: A: of states,B: united states,C: american state,D: traffic,E: california, Knowledge: The sentence mentions "crowded," which implies a high volume of traffic. "State highway" refers to a road maintained by a state government, rather than a federal or local government. The options "of states" and "united states" do not provide any relevant information, while "american state" is redundant since the sentence already mentions a state highway. Therefore, "traffic" cannot be the correct answer. California is known for having heavy traffic congestion, especially on its highways, making it the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- california
--input-- Question: The knowledge was expensive to get, where was it being gained? Options: A: university,B: book,C: field,D: meeting,E: class, Knowledge: The word "expensive" suggests that the knowledge was not something that could be easily obtained, and attending a university is often associated with high costs for tuition and fees. Universities are also known for offering in-depth and specialized education, which may require more resources and funding than other options like books or meetings. The other choices may provide access to knowledge, but they do not necessarily imply that the knowledge itself was expensive to obtain. Answer is
--target-- university
--input-- Question: What kind of entertainment may feature a talking weasel on an adventure? Options: A: children's story,B: forrest,C: mulberry bush,D: animated film,E: outdoors, Knowledge: The use of the term "animated" suggests that the entertainment in question involves some form of animation, which is typically associated with films. Additionally, anthropomorphized talking animals are a common feature in animated films for children, which eliminates options such as forrest, mulberry bush, and outdoors. The phrase "on an adventure" also implies a narrative structure, which is another characteristic of animated films. Therefore, the correct answer is animated film. Answer is
--target-- animated film
--input-- Question: A person misses his aunt, what is he likely to do about it? Options: A: cross street,B: amount to nothing,C: seek no help,D: doctor himself,E: visit relatives, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is missing their aunt, which implies that they have a desire to see her. The most appropriate answer would be to visit relatives, which could include the aunt in question. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not logical actions a person would take if they miss their aunt. Answer is
--target-- visit relatives
--input-- Question: If a person  answers the phone from a local area code, where might the call be coming from? Options: A: office,B: motel,C: desktop,D: rest area,E: neighbor's house, Knowledge: Local area codes are typically associated with specific geographic regions or cities, so if a call is coming from a local area code, it is likely that the caller is located in that area or nearby. The other options (office, motel, desktop, rest area) do not necessarily have a direct connection to the use of a local area code. Answer is
--target-- neighbor's house
--input-- Question: What is it called when life has an end date? Options: A: finite,B: over,C: good,D: important,E: ending soon, Knowledge: The question is referring to the concept of life having a limit or an end date. The word "finite" means having limits or bounds, which accurately describes the idea being referenced in the question. The other options ("over," "good," "important," and "ending soon") do not accurately describe the concept being referred to. Answer is
--target-- finite
--input-- Question: The gun was uncomfortable tucked in her pants, where did she put it? Options: A: drawer,B: holster,C: crime scene,D: police helicopter,E: police station, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the gun was not in a proper storage or carrying device, which resulted in discomfort for the person carrying it. The most logical option to alleviate the discomfort would be to put the gun in a holster, which is a device designed specifically to hold a firearm securely and comfortably on a person's body. The other options, such as a drawer, crime scene, police helicopter, and police station, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- holster
--input-- Question: The professor spoke in a laconic tone, what kind of language was he avoiding? Options: A: dry,B: prolix,C: loquacious,D: verbose,E: bombastic, Knowledge: The word "laconic" means using very few words, or being brief in speech. Therefore, the professor was not using a lot of words or being overly talkative, indicating that he was probably avoiding verbose language. The other options are all words that would describe using too many words, being overly complex, or overly dramatic in language, which is opposite to the meaning of "laconic". Answer is
--target-- verbose
--input-- Question: How would a human verbally great another? Options: A: drink tea,B: have to sleep,C: eat food,D: say hello,E: need money, Knowledge: Greeting someone verbally is a common practice in human interaction. While other options may be part of human behavior, such as eating or sleeping, they do not necessarily relate to the act of greeting someone. Saying hello is a common and polite way to greet someone in many cultures, which makes it the most appropriate answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- say hello
--input-- Question: During the roadtrip they finally stopped seeing signs for falling rock, there surroundings were getting less step as the entered the open what? Options: A: mountain range,B: countryside,C: volcano,D: ground,E: bridge, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the travelers were moving away from a mountainous area, as they were no longer seeing signs warning of falling rocks. This implies that they were entering a flatter area, which is commonly associated with countryside. Volcanoes and mountain ranges would not be described as "less steep" as they are inherently steep. "Ground" and "bridge" do not logically fit in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- countryside
--input-- Question: What is used in a bathroom when towels aren't available to get water off your hads? Options: A: dryer,B: roof,C: swimming pool,D: gym,E: pants, Knowledge: The sentence implies that towels are not available in the bathroom, which suggests that an alternative method for drying hands is needed. The most logical choice among the options is a dryer, which is commonly found in public restrooms as a hand drying option. The other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- dryer
--input-- Question: Where can leaves slide from and end up in a gutter? Options: A: trees,B: spout,C: roof,D: ground,E: street, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that leaves are sliding from a higher place (likely a roof) and ending up in a gutter. This would make sense as leaves on trees or the ground would not have the necessary elevation to slide into a gutter. A spout is also unlikely as it is usually connected to the gutter and wouldn't allow leaves to slide in. The street also does not make sense as gutters are usually located on the sides of buildings or homes, not in the middle of a street. Answer is
--target-- roof
--input-- Question: Though a bald eagle is synonymous with the USA, they can be found in what two word province too? Options: A: utah,B: france,C: chemotherapy,D: rocky mountains,E: british columbia, Knowledge: The sentence implies that bald eagles are not exclusive to the USA, and that they can be found in another place that is described as a "two word province." The option "british columbia" fits this description as it is a Canadian province located in the western region of the country, known for its abundance of wildlife and diverse ecosystems including coastal rainforests, mountains, and islands - all of which are ideal habitats for bald eagles. The other options do not fit the description of a two-word province, and do not have any clear connection to bald eagles. Answer is
--target-- british columbia
--input-- Question: The sickness was beginning to fade after resting, he was what? Options: A: relaxation,B: relaxation,C: feeling better,D: recuperation,E: doing nothing, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sickness is getting better after a period of rest, which would lead to the person feeling better.

--input-- Question: Curiosity was high since it was a good tour guide, she explained things first then took the group to what? Options: A: hear testimony,B: examine thing,C: surf net,D: browsing,E: see exhibits, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the group was on a tour and the tour guide was providing information about different things. The phrase "then took the group to" implies that the tour guide was leading them to a specific destination. The option "see exhibits" is the most logical answer as exhibits are usually the main attraction of a tour and are something people would be taken to. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to a physical destination that the tour guide would lead the group to. Answer is
--target-- see exhibits
--input-- Question: What might a doctor have to do in an emergency? Options: A: study medicine,B: care for patients,C: provide care,D: resuscitate,E: perform a physical, Knowledge: An emergency situation typically involves a critical medical condition where a patient's life is in danger. In such a situation, a doctor or any medical professional must perform resuscitation, which includes techniques such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or using a defibrillator to restart the patient's heart. Studying medicine, caring for patients, providing care, and performing a physical are all essential responsibilities of a doctor, but they may not be directly related to an emergency situation. Answer is
--target-- resuscitate
--input-- Question: The iphone can do many things.  If you threw away your iPod, you probably use your iPhone to do what? Options: A: show time,B: use calendar,C: display time,D: display position on map,E: play music, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the iPhone has features that can replace those of an iPod, which is a music player. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be related to music. Of the options provided, "play music" is the most closely related to the function of an iPod, while the others are more general features that the iPhone offers. Answer is
--target-- play music
--input-- Question: Some people just want to get away from it all, but that can be a problem if many people are also visiting the what? Options: A: disneyland,B: circus,C: supermarket,D: carnival,E: state park, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the problem with getting away from it all is that many people are also visiting the same place. This makes sense for state parks, which are often popular destinations for nature lovers looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. However, the other options are less likely to be crowded, especially considering that the sentence implies that many people are also visiting the same place. Disneyland, circus, supermarket, and carnival are generally crowded places, so they would not be suitable for getting away from it all. Answer is
--target-- state park
--input-- Question: How do you get good at playing guitar? Options: A: polish your guitar regularly.,B: pick,C: practice,D: have fun,E: desire, Knowledge: The most commonly accepted way to improve your skills in playing guitar is through practice. This involves consistently playing and practicing your skills over time, which helps you develop muscle memory and improve your technique. While polishing your guitar and having fun may also be important factors in enjoying the experience of playing guitar, they are not necessarily the key to becoming good at it. Similarly, having a desire or passion for playing guitar may motivate you to practice more, but it alone will not make you a skilled player. The term "pick" may refer to a guitar pick, but it is not a complete answer to the question and does not provide enough information to demonstrate knowledge of guitar-playing. Answer is
--target-- practice
--input-- Question: The dog had the sheep getting in line, it was amazing a dog could have what skills? Options: A: patience,B: intention,C: decision-making skills,D: buying movie tickets,E: basic organization, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog was able to get the sheep in line, which requires a certain level of organization to achieve. Basic organization skills, such as grouping similar items together or arranging things in a particular order, can be useful in controlling and directing the movements of others. Patience, intention, and decision-making skills may also be useful for a dog in this situation, but the sentence specifically mentions the dog's ability to organize the sheep. Buying movie tickets is unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- basic organization
--input-- Question: Mary was singing because she wasn't happen and she wanted to do what? Options: A: being heard,B: sore throats,C: hoarse voice,D: change in mood,E: sad, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mary was singing as a way to improve her mood, as she was not happy. Singing is often used as a form of self-expression and can be a cathartic activity that helps to release emotions. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as Mary's singing is not related to physical ailments such as sore throats or hoarse voices, and being heard or sad are not specific motivations for her singing. Answer is
--target-- change in mood
--input-- Question: What is a great thing to do with used glass? Options: A: shattered,B: recycled,C: shatter,D: tempered,E: broken, Knowledge: The question is asking for a positive action to take with used glass. Shattering, shatter, tempered, and broken all suggest destructive actions, so those options can be eliminated. Recycling, on the other hand, is a positive and environmentally-friendly action to take with used glass. Glass can be melted down and reused to create new products, reducing waste and conserving resources. Answer is
--target-- recycled
--input-- Question: The marathon included dancing for as long as possible for a prize, what did people feel as a result? Options: A: humiliation,B: sweaty,C: fatigue,D: blisters,E: exhaustion, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the marathon involved physically demanding activity (dancing) for a prolonged period of time, which would logically result in exhaustion. The other options (humiliation, sweaty, blisters) do not necessarily follow from the information given and seem less likely to be a direct consequence of the activity described. Fatigue is also a possibility, but exhaustion is a stronger and more specific answer choice. Answer is
--target-- exhaustion
--input-- Question: Someone who's belief in a philosophy is not slight but extreme is what? Options: A: significant,B: important,C: radical,D: radical,E: essencial, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's belief in a philosophy is not slight, but extreme. The word "radical" means extreme, especially in terms of political or social beliefs. The other options do not convey the same level of extremeness or intensity. "Significant" and "important" are neutral words that do not imply any extreme beliefs or actions, while "essencial" is a misspelling of the word "essential." Answer is
--target-- radical
--input-- Question: When Bob plugs has electricity next to his nightstand, where is he? Options: A: church,B: concert,C: opera,D: bedroom,E: restaurant, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob has access to electricity next to his nightstand, which is typically found in a bedroom. This eliminates the options of church, concert, opera, and restaurant, which are unlikely places to have a nightstand with an electrical outlet. Answer is

--input-- Question: John thought the distance between himself ahd Sally was insurmountable.  But when he opened up to her, he found that they shared something What did they share? Options: A: near,B: proximity,C: closeness,D: close,E: duration, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John initially thought that the distance between him and Sally was a problem, but that they later found out that they shared something. Based on this, it seems that the answer is likely to be a term that refers to emotional or psychological closeness between two people. "Closeness" therefore seems to be the most appropriate option, as it directly implies a sense of intimacy or emotional proximity. "Near," "proximity," and "close" are similar in meaning but do not necessarily suggest an emotional connection. "Duration" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- closeness
--input-- Question: What do I cook on the stove when I want to make tacos? Options: A: brown meat,B: mexico,C: open can,D: bake bread,E: warm food, Knowledge: Tacos typically involve a meat filling, such as ground beef, that needs to be cooked before it can be added to the taco shell. The phrase "cook on the stove" is a clue that the answer involves a cooking method, and out of the given choices, only "brown meat" is a cooking method that involves cooking something on a stove. The other choices, like "Mexico" and "bake bread," do not make sense in the context of cooking tacos. Answer is
--target-- brown meat
--input-- Question: The bald eagle flew over the potato fields over what region of the place known for them? Options: A: alaska,B: hells canyon,C: south lake tahoe,D: central idaho,E: canada, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are potato fields in this region, which narrows down the choices to regions known for potato farming. Alaska, Hells Canyon, and South Lake Tahoe are not typically associated with potato farming, while both Idaho and Canada are well-known for their potato production. However, the mention of "central" in the sentence indicates that the correct answer is Central Idaho, rather than Canada which is a larger country with potato fields in multiple regions. Answer is
--target-- central idaho
--input-- Question: If you see materials surrounded by workers you may be in what zone? Options: A: hazardous waste,B: construction,C: fabric store,D: science lab,E: house, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that workers are surrounding materials, which implies that there is some sort of construction or building work happening in the area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A hazardous waste zone might have materials and workers, but the sentence does not mention anything about hazardous materials specifically. A fabric store, science lab, or house would not typically have workers surrounding materials in the same way a construction site would. Answer is
--target-- construction
--input-- Question: Where is one likely to find many lawns? Options: A: golf course,B: front yard,C: suburbia,D: neighborhood,E: michigan, Knowledge: Lawns are typically associated with residential areas where homeowners have front or back yards.

Golf courses may have many lawns, but they are not common in everyday life and are usually reserved for recreational activities. The other options, such as a neighborhood or Michigan, do not have a clear association with lawns. Answer is
--target-- suburbia
--input-- Question: What would someone say about a tube television? Options: A: obsolete,B: addictive,C: entertaining,D: bycone,E: legal, Knowledge: The word "obsolete" means that something is no longer in use or has become outdated. Tube televisions are old technology that have largely been replaced by newer, more advanced displays like LCD and LED screens. Therefore, it would be accurate to describe a tube television as obsolete. The other options don't fit the context of the question- addictive, entertaining, bycone and legal all don't make sense in relation to a tube television. Answer is
--target-- obsolete
--input-- Question: Where is texas located? Options: A: mexico,B: texaphyrin,C: united states,D: southwest,E: gulf states, Knowledge: Texas is a state in the United States of America, located in the southern part of the country. It is bordered by Mexico to the south, but is not located within Mexico. Texaphyrin is a chemical compound and has no relation to the location of Texas. Southwest and Gulf States refer to regions within the United States, but do not answer the specific question of where Texas is located. Answer is

--input-- Question: John didn't like going to the square, but he did anyway.   Where might the square be? Options: A: geometry,B: circle,C: town center,D: fifties,E: carpenter's tool box, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the square is a location that John could go to despite his dislike for it, suggesting it is a place that is frequently visited. "Town center" is a common term used to describe the central commercial and social hub of a town, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not relate to a place that someone could go to on a regular basis. Answer is
--target-- town center

Options: A: state facts,B: teach pupils,C: group students,D: better knowledge,E: dividing students, Knowledge: The context of the question implies that the teacher wants to begin projects that involve collaboration among students.

Answer is
--target-- value life

Options: A: cupboard,B: everything,C: own home,D: stuff in home,E: garbage dump, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is something that everything is made of, which is a broad concept that encompasses all the choices given. However, the use of the phrase "when one thinks enough about it" implies that the answer may not be immediately obvious or intuitive. The options "cupboard," "own home," "stuff in home," and "garbage dump" are all specific and limited in scope, making them unlikely correct answers. "Everything" is the most all-encompassing and abstract option, aligning with the idea that all things are made of something. Answer is
--target-- everything

Fatigue and addiction may be associated with prolonged television viewing, but they are not a direct result of the screen itself. Power gains and entertainment are not related to the negative effects of television viewing. Answer is

Options: A: hundredweight,B: upper,C: hour,D: quarterlight,E: school year, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the speaker was waiting for a specific event to happen, but they knew it wouldn't happen right away. They then waited a quarter past a certain time before turning on the football game. The most likely option for this time is an hour, as it is a common unit of time measurement and fits with the quarter-past reference. The other options do not make sense in the context of waiting for a specific event to happen at a particular time. Answer is
--target-- hour

"Wall" and "store" are too vague and could refer to many different types of businesses, while "computer network" and "airport" are too specific and do not fit the broader context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- company

The option "sahara" is a desert and doesn't have trees or heavy rain; "disneyland" is a theme park and not a natural area; "street" is not an area with trees, and the option "seattle" is known for its heavy rainfall but doesn't specify any trees. This leaves "forest" as the only option that fits both criteria. Forests are known for their abundance of trees, and certain types of forests, such as rainforests, experience heavy rainfall.

Options: A: country,B: continent,C: west virginia,D: mountainous region,E: mountainous area, Knowledge: Death Valley is a large national park located in the western United States. It is well known and often visited by tourists from all over the world, making it highly unlikely that it would be located in a region as specific as West Virginia or Mountainous Area. Additionally, Death Valley is a significant enough location to be referred to by the continent it is located on, rather than just the country. Therefore, the correct answer is continent. Answer is
--target-- continent

--input-- Question: Where can you buy a fashionable satchel? Options: A: luggage compartment,B: airport,C: room,D: clothing store,E: canada, Knowledge: The word "fashionable" suggests that the satchel is likely to be found in a store that sells clothing and accessories instead of a place like an airport or luggage compartment.

Options: A: chicken coop,B: law office,C: dog house,D: hollow log,E: backyards, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the weasel was searching for something specific in the garbage, which is likely to be food. Backyards are a common place where people dispose of food scraps and other organic waste, which would make them a likely target for a scavenging weasel. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Options: A: floor,B: computer game,C: art,D: song,E: roof, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the graphic designer worked with digital tiles, which suggests that they worked in a digital medium.

--target-- computer game
--input-- Question: Bill crossed a boundary in his daily life and transgressed against an important rule of what? Options: A: delineating political unit,B: sporting event,C: society,D: basketball,E: basketball, Knowledge: The word "transgressed" implies that Bill broke a rule or boundary that was socially or morally significant. The fact that the context does not mention anything about politics or sports suggests that the correct answer is likely to be "society". The inclusion of "basketball" twice in the choices is likely a mistake or typo. Answer is
--target-- society
--input-- Question: Where would you find teeth whitening bleachers? Options: A: gymnasium,B: soccer game,C: sporting event,D: pharmacy,E: soccer game, Knowledge: Teeth whitening bleachers are a cosmetic dental product, which would not be found at a gymnasium or sporting event. The correct answer would likely be a place that sells dental or oral care products, such as a pharmacy.

--target-- pharmacy

Options: A: deep south,B: united states,C: gulf states,D: swamp,E: 98 of world's crayfish, Knowledge: Louisiana is one state out of 50 in the United States, so the correct answer is "united states."

Options: A: go to bed,B: become adult,C: read book,D: grow up,E: clean room, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child has finished playing with their toys and needs to do something next. The option "clean room" is the most logical choice as it is a common instruction given to children after they finish playing with their toys. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - "go to bed" is more suitable as a bedtime instruction, "become adult" and "grow up" are milestones that occur over time and not something that can be done immediately, and "read book" is not related to cleaning up after playing with toys. Answer is
--target-- clean room
--input-- Question: What do you call the feet on a dog? Options: A: two ears,B: paws,C: one mouth,D: big heart,E: tail, Knowledge: The sentence is asking for the name of the feet on a dog. The word "paws" is commonly used to refer to the feet of dogs (and other animals with similar feet). The other options (two ears, one mouth, big heart, tail) do not refer to the feet of a dog, and therefore are not the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- paws

Options: A: bathroom,B: apartment,C: stall,D: hospital,E: rest area, Knowledge: Rest areas are public areas along highways or major roads where travelers can stop to take a break and use the facilities.

Options: A: cathedral,B: bridge,C: building,D: ancient rome,E: hole, Knowledge: The use of an arch as a doorway is a common architectural feature in buildings, where it adds both aesthetic value and structural strength. While arches may also be used in bridges and cathedrals, the sentence specifically refers to a doorway, suggesting that it is more likely to be found in a building. The option "ancient Rome" may be a distractor, as the use of arches was prominent in Roman architecture, but it does not directly relate to the context of the sentence. The option "hole" is clearly not appropriate for the sentence. Answer is
--target-- building

Options: A: garden,B: bathroom,C: classroom,D: home,E: university, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the poet needed to write about his distant past, which is likely to be related to his personal life experiences. Therefore, the most appropriate place for the poet to go to write about his past is likely to be his own home, where he may have access to personal documents, photographs or other memorabilia that can help him remember his past experiences. The other options do not seem to have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- home

Options: A: locker room,B: in the showers,C: linen closet,D: swimming pool,E: cupboard, Knowledge: A towel is often used in a gym for wiping sweat off during or after a workout, and it makes sense to keep them close by in the locker room where gym-goers change and store their belongings.

A linen closet or cupboard may be used to store towels in other contexts, but it is less likely in a gym setting. Answer is
--target-- locker room

Options: A: pregnancy,B: hungry,C: insomnia,D: sleeping in,E: making love, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob is not going to bed despite it being a weekday, which implies that he is not able to sleep.

Options: A: office supply store,B: desk drawer,C: schools,D: under the arm,E: pencil box, Knowledge: The question implies that the eraser will be used in class, so it should be brought to school. The choices "office supply store" and "schools" are not places to put the eraser, but rather places to acquire an eraser. "Under the arm" is not a practical place to put an eraser while traveling. The most logical answer is to put the eraser in a pencil box, which can be easily carried to class. Answer is
--target-- pencil box
--input-- Question: A shark is stuck in a lake, where does it need to go provided it isn't a bull shark? Options: A: medium,B: saltwater,C: sea world,D: atlantic ocean,E: seawater, Knowledge: Sharks are typically found in saltwater environments, such as the ocean. Bull sharks are one of the few shark species that can tolerate freshwater and are sometimes found in rivers and lakes. However, the question specifically states that it is not a bull shark, so the answer must be one of the options related to saltwater environments. Sea world is a theme park and not a location where a shark could go to live, so it can be ruled out. "Medium" and "seawater" may not be specific enough to indicate that the shark needs to go to a saltwater environment, whereas "Atlantic Ocean" specifically refers to a saltwater environment. Therefore, "saltwater" is the best answer. Answer is
--target-- saltwater
--input-- Question: The men talked at length and found they were agreeing with a lot of things, how would they describe their feeling toward one another? Options: A: problem,B: peace,C: love,D: contract,E: like, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the men had a positive conversation and found common ground, which suggests they had a friendly relationship. Describing their feeling toward one another as "like" would be a natural choice to convey this sense of mutual respect and agreement. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. "Problem" and "contract" have negative connotations and do not fit with the positive tone of the conversation. "Peace" and "love" are also unlikely choices as they suggest a deeper emotional connection that may not be present in this context. Answer is
--target-- like
--input-- Question: Where do you get a table? Options: A: demonstration,B: kitchen,C: furniture store,D: hallway,E: apartment, Knowledge: The question is asking where to get a specific item, a table.

The other options, such as demonstration, kitchen, hallway, and apartment, do not offer a clear connection to purchasing furniture. Answer is
--target-- furniture store
--input-- Question: What might intense competing cause someone to feel? Options: A: argument,B: tension,C: anger,D: happiness,E: stress, Knowledge: The word "intense" suggests a high level of competition, which can be a source of stress for many people. Stress is a common response to intense competition because it can cause feelings of pressure, anxiety, and overwhelm. The other options, like argument and tension, may be outcomes of intense competition, but they are not directly related to how someone might feel in response to it. Anger and happiness are also unlikely because they are emotions that are typically associated with a personal victory or defeat, rather than a response to competition itself. Answer is
--target-- stress
--input-- Question: Every Monday morning he would meet friend, they would have coffee and a good what? Options: A: say'hi,B: have sex,C: conversation,D: handshake,E: train, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person meets their friend every Monday morning to engage in an activity that involves both coffee and conversation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Saying "hi" or shaking hands could be a part of the greeting, but they would not typically be the main activity. Having sex or taking a train do not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- conversation
--input-- Question: Where is a good place to get food for most people? Options: A: fridge,B: oven,C: supermarket,D: kitchen,E: table, Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer should refer to a place where most people can get food, which rules out options like the fridge, oven, and kitchen as not everyone has access to these. The table is also not a good answer as it is not a place where one can get food, but rather a surface where food can be served. The most plausible answer is the supermarket, as it is a place where a variety of foods can be purchased and is accessible to most people. Answer is
--target-- supermarket
--input-- Question: The predator was committing murder, what was his intention to his victim? Options: A: kill,B: distress,C: strangle,D: die,E: dead, Knowledge: The word "murder" implies that the predator intentionally caused the death of their victim, so the correct answer would be "kill." The other options may also be associated with causing harm or pain to someone, but they do not specifically relate to causing death. Answer is
--target-- kill
--input-- Question: What should a savvy consumer do when being presented with proof for the effectiveness of a product that seem too good to be true? Options: A: exasperation,B: change of heart,C: scrutinizing,D: boredom,E: read, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the consumer should be cautious when presented with proof that seems too good to be true. Scrutinizing means examining something closely and carefully, which is a good approach to determine whether the proof is legitimate or not. Exasperation, change of heart, and boredom do not suggest any action the consumer can take to evaluate the proof. Reading is a general action and does not necessarily relate to the context of being presented with proof. Answer is
--target-- scrutinizing
--input-- Question: The portly man was having lunch, he ate so fast he didn't chew small enough pieces and sure enough began to what? Options: A: choke,B: getting full,C: burp,D: eat food,E: regurgitating, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man ate his lunch quickly and did not chew his food properly, which led to a negative consequence. Choking is a common risk of swallowing large pieces of food without proper mastication, so this is the most logical choice. Getting full, burping, eating food, and regurgitating do not fit with the context of the sentence or contribute to the logical progression of events. Answer is
--target-- choke

--target-- play music
--input-- Question: There was a sign telling picnickers not to feed squirrels, where was this sign likely placed? Options: A: park,B: forest,C: tree,D: roof,E: yard, Knowledge: The sign is specifically referring to picnickers, suggesting that they are in a public area where people go to have picnics, such as a park. Squirrels can be found in many environments, including forests, trees, roofs, and yards, but the mention of picnickers implies an area specifically designated for recreational activities. Therefore, the correct answer is park. Answer is
--target-- park
--input-- Question: If someone doesn't enjoy playing baseball what might they call it? Options: A: happiness,B: fun,C: entertainment,D: love,E: stupid, Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a negative association with baseball, and "stupid" is the only option that suggests a dislike or disdain for the activity. The other options all suggest positive feelings towards baseball, which would not make sense in the context of someone who does not enjoy it. "Fun," "entertainment," and "love" are all positive words that indicate enjoyment, whereas "stupid" is a negative word that suggests a lack of interest or distaste. Answer is
--target-- stupid

Options: A: be still,B: stay put,C: stay still,D: sit still,E: standing still, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had been sitting in meetings for a long time and needed to move, implying that they were sitting still for an extended period.

Answer is
--target-- sit still

Options: A: back yard,B: hen house,C: storybook,D: natural habitat,E: bathroom, Knowledge: Foxes are wild animals that typically live in their natural habitat, such as forests, grasslands, and deserts. They may occasionally wander into residential areas like backyards or hen houses in search of food, but these are not their everyday habitats. Storybooks and bathrooms are not places where foxes would typically go, making natural habitat the most likely answer. Answer is
--target-- natural habitat
--input-- Question: Where do people view more than one rosebush? Options: A: hedgerow,B: temperate climate,C: botanical gardens,D: beehouse,E: backyard, Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is asking about a place where people go to view multiple rosebushes. While small plantings of roses may be found in some of the other options (such as a backyard or hedgerow), the only option that specifically refers to a location with multiple varieties of plants is a botanical garden. Additionally, botanical gardens often have dedicated rose gardens or sections, making them a likely answer. Answer is

--input-- Question: Where would you store glue when it's not in use? Options: A: desk drawer,B: art room,C: classroom,D: bathroom,E: school, Knowledge: Glue is a common item used in office and school settings, and it is typically stored in a desk drawer or supply cabinet when not in use. The other options, such as art room or bathroom, may also be places where glue is used, but they are not as common for storage purposes.

--target-- use water

Options: A: adverse reaction,B: teach,C: friendship,D: rumors spread,E: increased understanding, Knowledge: The word "false stories" suggests that the act of talking to others about them may lead to the spread of rumors. Rumors are often based on untrue or exaggerated information that is passed from person to person through conversation. Adverse reactions, such as disagreement or anger, can be a result of spreading false stories, but it is less likely to be the direct outcome. Teaching, friendship, and increased understanding are not directly related to the act of talking about false stories. Answer is
--target-- rumors spread
--input-- Question: What is the yellow color of the sun an example of? Options: A: english carrier,B: achromatic,C: courageous,D: bright,E: fearless, Knowledge: The word "achromatic" refers to colors that have no hue, such as white, black, and shades of gray.

The other options are not relevant to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- achromatic

Options: A: bar,B: human being,C: cemetary,D: graveyard,E: earth, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the spirit was leaving the physical body of a human being and transitioning to the afterlife. The options "bar," "cemetery," and "graveyard" do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are locations rather than the thing that the spirit was leaving. "Earth" is too general and could refer to many things, but "human being" directly relates to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- human being

Options: A: sadistic dentist's office,B: atmosphere,C: laboratory,D: chemistry lab,E: moon, Knowledge: The sentence mentions a helium tank being used for research, suggesting that the correct answer is related to scientific work. The options "sadistic dentist's office" and "moon" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence. "Atmosphere" is a possibility, but it does not specifically relate to research. "Chemistry lab" and "laboratory" both indicate a scientific purpose, but "chemistry lab" may be too specific and limiting, whereas "laboratory" could encompass various fields of research that may use helium tanks. Therefore, the best choice is "laboratory." Answer is
--target-- laboratory 
--input-- Question: What might help someone locate the United States? Options: A: north america,B: northern hemisphere,C: western hemisphere,D: magnets,E: map, Knowledge: The best way to locate the United States is by using a map. The other options do not provide a clear method for finding the country. North America is a continent that includes the United States but does not pinpoint its location.

Options: A: annoyance,B: hospitalized,C: schizophrenia,D: broken heart,E: stress, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker experienced a romantic breakup, which can often result in emotional distress and a feeling of heartbreak. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence – annoyance may be a reaction to the breakup, but does not describe the speaker's emotional state, and hospitalized and schizophrenia are not related to the situation at all.

--input-- Question: The crab was being netted of the coast of Louisiana, where was he caught? Options: A: tidepools,B: fishing boat,C: north sea,D: gulf of mexico,E: grocery store, Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the crab was being netted off the coast of Louisiana, which is a state located on the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, it is likely that the crab was caught in the Gulf of Mexico. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Tidepools are typically located near rocky shores and would not be a common place to catch crabs, while the North Sea is located in Europe, making it an unlikely location for a crab caught off the coast of Louisiana. A grocery store is a place where people buy food, not where crabs are caught. A fishing boat is a possible location for catching crabs, but the sentence does not provide any direct evidence to support this option. Answer is
--target-- gulf of mexico

Answer is
--target-- relax
--input-- Question: What do facts enable a person to do ? Options: A: intelligent children,B: have confidence,C: acknowledgment,D: wonderful memories,E: know truth, Knowledge: The word "facts" suggests that the sentence is referring to knowledge that is based on objective evidence and can be verified. The phrase "know truth" is a common expression used to describe the pursuit of accurate, verifiable knowledge. The other options, such as "intelligent children" or "wonderful memories", do not directly relate to the concept of factual knowledge. Similarly, "acknowledgment" and "confidence" may be desirable outcomes of knowing the truth, but they are not the same as knowing the truth itself. Answer is
--target-- know truth

Options: A: humans,B: city,C: movie theaters,D: arena,E: courthouse, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ticket offices being referred to are all of the same type, which implies that they are part of a larger organization, such as a chain of movie theaters. The other 
options do not have any clear connection to the concept of ticket offices being uniform or part of a larger group. Answer is
--target-- movie theaters
--input-- Question: What should people do right after getting paid? Options: A: satisfaction,B: happiness,C: shopping,D: paying bills,E: spending money, Knowledge: The sentence implies that after getting paid, there is something specific that people should do.

--input-- Question: Where might we find a place to stay that only has one floor? Options: A: mexico,B: magic,C: hotel,D: phone book,E: motel, Knowledge: The word "motel" typically refers to a type of lodging that is usually limited to one or two floors, as opposed to a hotel which may have multiple floors. The other options, such as Mexico or magic, do not suggest anything about the number of floors in a place to stay, and a phone book would only provide a list of options, not information about the type of lodging. Answer is
--target-- motel
--input-- Question: The farmer could raise a good chicken, but he wasn't ready to move up to a what? Options: A: rooster,B: hen,C: bought at store,D: cow,E: tuna, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer was good at raising chickens, but he wasn't ready to move up to something else. The options "rooster" and "hen" are both types of chickens, so they do not fit the context of the sentence. "Bought at store" is also unrelated, as it doesn't refer to any specific animal. "Tuna" is a type of fish, which is also unrelated. "Cow" is a larger animal and would represent a step up in terms of the complexity of the farming operation, making it the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- cow
--input-- Question: It wasn't something he had had before, but he found the chicken and grape vinaigrette what to be delicious? Options: A: bowl of fruit,B: salad,C: table,D: food store,E: restaurant, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is describing a dish made with chicken and grape vinaigrette dressing. This type of dish is commonly referred to as a salad, which typically includes lettuce or other greens as a base. The other options, such as a bowl of fruit or a table, do not make sense in the context of describing a dish. Food store and restaurant are possible options, but the sentence doesn't give enough information to suggest whether the dish was bought from a store or eaten at a restaurant. Answer is

--input-- Question: Where is a reception desk typically located? Options: A: at hotel,B: motel,C: inside,D: office park,E: lobby, Knowledge: The word "reception desk" implies a place where guests or visitors are greeted and checked in. In most cases, this would be located in a public area such as a lobby, where it is easily accessible and visible to those who are arriving. The other options may have desks, but they are less likely to have a dedicated reception desk, and would not be appropriate in the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- lobby
--input-- Question: Where should a human go if they have a full feeling in their bladder? Options: A: school,B: outside,C: restroom,D: cornfield,E: star trek, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is experiencing a physical sensation related to their bladder, which typically indicates a need to urinate. Restrooms are the most common place to relieve oneself in this situation, while the other options do not provide obvious relief or may be inappropriate. Going outside or into a cornfield may not be socially acceptable or sanitary, and school or Star Trek do not offer any logical solutions to a physical bodily sensation. Answer is
--target-- restroom
--input-- Question: The Mississippi is a very large river, it is the largest in the North American what? Options: A: wilderness,B: country,C: city,D: bridge,E: continent, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the Mississippi River is the largest in a certain region, which is further specified as North America. This means that the other options, such as wilderness or city, are not likely to be accurate choices since they do not describe a larger region. The word "continent" makes sense as a choice because it refers to a large landmass, and it also matches with the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- continent
--input-- Question: If I am not good at playing poker, I will begin what if I play? Options: A: discord,B: social event,C: losing money,D: competition,E: heightened awareness, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person playing poker is not good at it, and the question is about what will happen if they continue to play. Losing money is a common result of playing poker, especially if one is not skilled at it. Discord, social events, competition, and heightened awareness are not necessarily related to playing poker or the consequences of not being good at it. Answer is
--target-- losing money
--input-- Question: Where is a special wild rosebush found? Options: A: botanic garden,B: flower garden,C: california,D: courtyard,E: landscaping, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wild rosebush being referred to is a special or unique one, indicating that it may not be commonly found in most locations. The options "botanic garden," "flower garden," and "landscaping" all suggest more controlled and planned environments, making it less likely for a wild rosebush to be found there. "Courtyard" could potentially be a location where a rare wild rosebush is found, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer. Therefore, "California" is the most likely answer since it is a large state with diverse geography and flora, and could potentially be home to a special wild rosebush. Answer is
--target-- california
--input-- Question: Where are mine's typically located under? Options: A: pennsylvania,B: desert,C: valley,D: cambodia,E: mountain, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that mines are typically located under something, which could be a geographical feature like a valley or mountain. Of the options provided, only "mountain" fits this description. Pennsylvania and Cambodia are both regions that have mines, but the sentence does not suggest a specific location. The words "desert" and "valley" do not provide any information about where mines are typically found. Answer is
--target-- mountain
--input-- Question: The writer began to contemplate the purpose of his story that he had lost along the way, soon he began to finally what? Options: A: get ideas,B: daydream,C: headache,D: become distracted,E: gave up, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the writer was struggling with his story and trying to reconnect with its purpose. The phrase "soon he began to finally" implies that a positive change occurred. "Get ideas" is the most logical choice because it suggests that the writer was able to overcome his writer's block and generate new ideas. "Daydream" and "become distracted" are possibilities, but they do not necessarily suggest that the writer was able to solve his problem. "Headache" and "gave up" are clearly not the correct answer, as they are negative outcomes. Answer is
--target-- get ideas
--input-- Question: The trombone is a very animated instrument, it fits in really well on the field as a member of the what? Options: A: marching band,B: campus band,C: school band,D: brass quartet,E: orchestra, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trombone is a lively and energetic instrument, which is a common characteristic of instruments played in marching bands. Marching bands perform outdoors and often move around, so they need instruments that can be heard over the noise of a crowd and the movement of the performers. The other options may not necessarily require an animated instrument like the trombone. Answer is
--target-- marching band

Options: A: express emotion,B: beautifull,C: irritate,D: bad environment,E: quiet mind, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John used music as a tool to help him focus, which implies that the music had a calming or soothing effect.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- quiet mind
--input-- Question: Where in a meadow would a snake hide? Options: A: underwater,B: tropical forest,C: amazon river,D: western texas,E: high grass, Knowledge: Snakes are known to hide in areas with plenty of cover, and tall grass is a common place for them to seek shelter in meadows.

--input-- Question: He went to relax and be in nature more than anything, he didn't go fishing just to what? Options: A: catching fish,B: wade in,C: catch fish,D: fall into water,E: sleep, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person's primary intention for going fishing was to relax and be in nature. Therefore, it would not make sense for them to be solely focused on catching fish, as that would make the activity more stressful and less enjoyable. The other options are either irrelevant or contradictory to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- catch fish
--input-- Question: Where could you find a quite old clavichord? Options: A: parlor,B: music hall,C: make music,D: museum,E: music room, Knowledge: The use of the word "old" suggests that the clavichord is an antique item.

Options: A: crash,B: accelerate,C: turn around,D: catch on fire,E: carry freight, Knowledge: In order to take off, an airplane needs to accelerate down the runway.

--input-- Question: What would a rock form in nature above the treeline? Options: A: surface of earth,B: pit,C: bridge,D: mountains,E: minerals, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is specifically referring to something that can form above treeline, which is the elevation point beyond which trees cannot grow. Mountains are typically found at high elevations and can form above treeline due to various geological processes such as folding and faulting. The other options (surface of earth, pit, bridge, minerals) do not necessarily have a direct connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- mountains
--input-- Question: What does a farmer wanting to make a maze do? Options: A: farm land,B: grow chinese gooseberries,C: grow corn,D: raise cattle,E: supply food, Knowledge: The word "maze" suggests that the farmer is creating a corn maze, which is a popular activity in many regions. Corn is a common crop used for mazes because it grows tall and dense, making it easy to create pathways through the stalks. The other choices do not relate to the activity of creating a maze. Answer is
--target-- grow corn
--input-- Question: If a chicken crossed a busy road you'd say it was stupid or what? Options: A: eaten,B: egg,C: being brave,D: beef,E: smashed, Knowledge: The question implies that crossing a busy road is a dangerous action, so choosing an answer that suggests the chicken survived the crossing would be inaccurate. "Stupid" is a negative adjective that implies the chicken was foolish or didn't understand the danger of crossing the road. "Eaten" and "smashed" both suggest the chicken met an unfortunate end. "Egg" and "beef" are not appropriate choices as they are not related to the context of the question. "Being brave" is the most appropriate choice as it suggests that the chicken took a risk by crossing the road and demonstrated courage or fearlessness in doing so. Answer is
--target-- being brave
--input-- Question: What sport do fans often watch people loose teeth? Options: A: football,B: soccer game,C: race track,D: hockey game,E: sporting event, Knowledge: It is common for players in hockey games to experience physical contact and collisions, which can result in injuries such as lost teeth.

--target-- hockey game

Options: A: board a train,B: in charge of project,C: begin work,D: run marathon,E: go to school, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the people in the protagonist's neighborhood were likely facing difficulties that caused them to quit or drop out of something.

The other options do not seem to align with the sense of ambition conveyed in the sentence. Answer is

Options: A: hot room,B: sports stadium,C: appliance store,D: hockey game,E: sauna, Knowledge: A fan is typically used in a setting that is hot or lacks air circulation, such as a hot room.

Options: A: refrigerator,B: kitchen,C: fast food restaurant,D: grocery store,E: refridgerator, Knowledge: Ketchup is a condiment that is commonly found in grocery stores.

The other options are not relevant to the context of the question. Answer is
--target-- grocery store
--input-- Question: Where is the mailbox that the residents use? Options: A: door bell,B: apartment complex,C: street corner,D: front door,E: post office, Knowledge: The question suggests that the mailbox is located within a residential building, which eliminates the options of street corner and post office.

--target-- mining operation

Options: A: run quickly,B: drink water,C: go away,D: pull cart,E: gallup, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the action of slapping a horse's butt results in it galloping, but the context suggests that this only applies when the person is on the horse. If someone were to slap a horse's butt while they were off of it, it is unlikely that the horse would respond by running quickly or galloping.

Arizona is known for its hot and arid climate, making it the most likely option. Farm yards and Michigan do not provide any information about the climate, and the option of a western movie is too general to be a likely answer. South is too broad and could refer to many different locations with varying climates. Answer is
--target-- arizona

Options: A: open them,B: lift up,C: picking up,D: catch,E: pick up, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mail service does something with packages besides just dropping them off.

Answer is

While it is possible to learn these subjects outside of school through other means such as books or online resources, the context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking where a computer user can learn these subjects. Therefore, the best option would be school, as it is a common place for computer users to access educational resources and online learning materials. The other options do not have any clear connection to education or learning. Answer is
--target-- school

Options: A: marching band,B: orchestra,C: dance club,D: high school band,E: music shop, Knowledge: The other options are all places where a person might play a trumpet, but they are unlikely to sell trumpets to customers.

--target-- music shop
--input-- Question: If I am using deodorant, where should i put it? Options: A: medicine chest,B: armpits,C: grocery store,D: on my hand,E: own bathroom, Knowledge: Deodorant is typically used to reduce or eliminate unwanted body odors, particularly in the underarm area.

Options: A: bellhop,B: strip mall,C: beautifying hair,D: clerk,E: neighborhood, Knowledge: A clerk is a person who works at a front desk or reception area of a business, and is typically responsible for checking people in and out. In the context of a beauty salon, a clerk would likely be the one to greet customers, schedule appointments, and check them in for their services. The other options are not relevant to the context of a beauty salon, with a bellhop typically working at a hotel, a strip mall being a type of shopping center, and "beautifying hair" and "neighborhood" not being job titles or roles. Answer is
--target-- clerk
--input-- Question: There is usually a drawer in what item that is used during your occupation? Options: A: nightstand,B: office desk,C: file cabinet,D: kitchen cabinet,E: filing cabinet, Knowledge: The word "occupation" suggests that the item in question is related to work or a job. The other options (nightstand, kitchen cabinet) do not typically have drawers that are useful for work-related purposes. File cabinets and filing cabinets are specifically designed for storing files, so they may have more than one drawer and are less likely to be associated with a single drawer. Therefore, the most likely item with a single drawer that is used during work would be an office desk. Answer is
--target-- office desk

Options: A: airport,B: bed,C: library,D: kitchen,E: dentist, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is waiting in a place where machines and instruments are being used, which is likely a medical or dental office.

--input-- Question: Where are plants happiest in the spring? Options: A: garden,B: surface of earth,C: in the shade,D: park,E: greenhouse, Knowledge: Spring is a time of growth and rejuvenation for many plants, making them happiest in a space where they have room to grow and receive adequate sunlight. A garden is a natural environment that provides both of these needs, and is therefore the best choice among the options presented. The surface of the earth could refer to any outdoor space, but does not suggest the additional factors of sunlight and growth that are important for plants in the spring. In the shade and in a greenhouse, plants may not receive enough sunlight to reach their full potential. A park is not necessarily designed for plants to thrive, but rather as a space for recreation and relaxation. Answer is
--target-- garden
--input-- Question: Where would someone keep an unused hat? Options: A: suitcase,B: closet,C: begging,D: head,E: lawnmower, Knowledge: The options "suitcase", "begging", "head", and "lawnmower" are unlikely places to keep an unused hat. A "suitcase" is typically used for traveling and would not be a logical choice for keeping a hat that is not in use. "Begging" has no connection to the context of the sentence. "Head" would be a logical place to keep a hat that is in use, but not for an unused one. Similarly, a "lawnmower" is not a place to keep any type of clothing. Therefore, "closet" is the most logical answer as it is a common storage place for items of clothing. Answer is
--target-- closet
--input-- Question: The cat pawed demurely at the couch and walked in front of the TV, where was the cat? Options: A: family room,B: back yard,C: residential area,D: bathroom,E: comfortable position, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat was inside a house since it pawed at a couch and walked in front of a TV. The options "back yard," "residential area," and "bathroom" do not fit this context. The option "comfortable position" may be a possible answer, but it is not specific enough to accurately answer the question. "Family room" is the most appropriate answer because it is a common area in a house where a couch and TV would be found, and where a cat would likely be inside the house. Answer is
--target-- family room
--input-- Question: WHat does a real estate agent do when there is something wrong with the house they are showing? Options: A: charming,B: incompetent,C: exaggerate,D: cover up,E: deceive, Knowledge: When a real estate agent is showing a property that has some sort of issue or problem, they may try to cover it up or hide it from potential buyers.

Options: A: most cities,B: local town,C: military base,D: detroit,E: urban area, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is at a field hospital, which is usually associated with military bases or locations where there is active military conflict. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Detroit and other cities and towns may have hospitals, but they are not typically referred to as "field hospitals." "Urban area" is also too broad and does not provide any specific information about the location of a field hospital. Answer is
--target-- military base
--input-- Question: What is the consequence of a long day of doing housework? Options: A: low pay,B: become tired,C: nice home,D: boredom,E: dizziness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that doing housework for a long time can have a negative effect on a person. One common consequence of extended physical activity is fatigue or feeling tired, which is likely the correct answer. Low pay, nice home, boredom, and dizziness are not directly related to the context of the sentence and do not make sense as a consequence of doing housework. Answer is
--target-- become tired
--input-- Question: Where is a large city hall usually located? Options: A: detroit,B: major city,C: downtown area,D: dallas,E: towns, Knowledge: City halls are usually located in the central business district or downtown area of a city.

Options: A: get pregnant,B: throwing up,C: tumor,D: toxicity,E: frequent urination, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the man passed out due to the consumption of alcohol, which can lead to alcohol toxicity. Alcohol toxicity occurs when there is an excessive amount of alcohol in the bloodstream, which can lead to impaired cognitive functions and even unconsciousness. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- toxicity
--input-- Question: The two parties could neither confirm nor compromise on anything, they were in a what? Options: A: question,B: contradict,C: deny,D: asking,E: dispute, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the two parties were unable to reach an agreement or come to a resolution, suggesting that they were in a dispute. The other options do not accurately describe the situation presented in the sentence. "Question" implies that the parties were merely unsure of something, "contradict" suggests that they were actively opposing each other's positions, "deny" implies that one party refused to accept the other's proposal, and "asking" does not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- dispute
--input-- Question: What would you do to numbers that are positive integers to get a smaller result? Options: A: written down,B: added up,C: start number game,D: divided,E: multiplied, Knowledge: The question asks for a method that will give a smaller result, which suggests that we need to reduce the size of the number. Adding or multiplying positive integers will always result in a larger number, so we can eliminate those options. Written down and start number game do not make any sense in the context of the question. Dividing a positive integer by another positive integer will always result in a smaller number, which makes it the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- divided
--input-- Question: If you break someone's nose while wrestling what will come out of it? Options: A: erections,B: wins,C: bruises,D: aches and pains,E: blood, Knowledge: Breaking someone's nose is likely to cause bleeding as this part of the body has many blood vessels close to the surface.

--target-- blood
--input-- Question: Bill did not revere the holy man but he also didn't disdain him.  Bill had what for the man? Options: A: reverence,B: honor,C: admire,D: respect,E: thankfulness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill did not have extreme feelings of either admiration or disdain for the holy man. The word "revere" means to show deep respect or worship whereas "disdain" means to look down upon or despise. Therefore, it can be inferred that Bill had a moderate level of respect for the holy man, which is the best option among the choices. "Honour" and "admire" both suggest a higher level of admiration than what is described in the sentence, while "thankfulness" is not relevant to the context. Answer is
--target-- respect

The other options do not have any clear connection to creating a space for reading and browsing. Answer is
--target-- bookstore
--input-- Question: If a student is staring at the ceiling while bored, where are they likely to be? Options: A: most architectural structures,B: loft,C: house,D: temple,E: classroom, Knowledge: The question suggests that the context is related to a place where students might get bored enough to look at the ceiling. While it is possible that this could happen in other locations, such as a house or loft, it is more likely to happen in a classroom where students are expected to sit still and listen to a lecture or read quietly for an extended period of time. Temples and most architectural structures may not necessarily be places where students spend a lot of time getting bored. Answer is

--input-- Question: Where are prepared mushrooms purchased? Options: A: refrigerator,B: ground,C: grocery store,D: pizza,E: forest, Knowledge: The question is asking where prepared mushrooms are purchased, suggesting that they have been processed or packaged in some way. The option "refrigerator" does not specify where the refrigerator is located or what it contains, making it an unlikely choice. "Ground" is nonsensical in this context. "Pizza" refers to a dish that can contain mushrooms, but it does not answer the question of where prepared mushrooms are purchased. "Forest" refers to where mushrooms may grow naturally, but it is not a place where they are typically purchased in a prepared form. "Grocery store" is the most logical choice as it is a common retail location where packaged and processed foods, including prepared mushrooms, can be found. Answer is
--target-- grocery store

Options: A: sing,B: play piano,C: attend classical concert,D: listen to radio,E: play violin, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a great love of music, but it does not specify that they play an instrument or sing.

The other options are specific and may not apply to everyone who has a love for music. Answer is
--target-- listen to radio
--input-- Question: While chatting with friends for hours, what did the formerly lonely man feel? Options: A: happiness,B: tiredness,C: communication,D: agreement,E: answers, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the formerly lonely man chatted with friends for a long time. It is likely that he would feel happiness after spending time with friends and enjoying their company. Tiredness may be a possibility, but it is not the most likely option given that the sentence contains no indication that the man was physically or mentally taxed after the conversation. Communication and agreement are too vague to be the answer, and answers is not a fitting option given that it suggests that the man was seeking responses to specific questions, which is not implied in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- happiness
--input-- Question: Where might a fluffy chair be found? Options: A: living room,B: desk,C: office,D: porch,E: fluffy house, Knowledge: A fluffy chair typically refers to a comfortable and cushioned chair, often with a soft fabric. The living room is a common area of a house where people sit and relax, making it a likely location for a fluffy chair. The desk and office are typically associated with work and may have more functional chairs. The porch may also have chairs, but they are more likely to be outdoor furniture rather than the plush and cozy chairs that would be found inside a home. "Fluffy house" is not a common term and does not provide any useful information. Answer is
--target-- living room
--input-- Question: When starting a fire near oxygen what can happen? Options: A: warmth,B: chaos,C: unpredictable,D: disaster,E: explosion, Knowledge: Oxygen is highly flammable, and when combined with a source of ignition, can lead to an explosion.

--input-- Question: Billy thought that he was smart, but many of his attitudes didn't were very regressive. How might you describe him? Options: A: backward,B: ignorant,C: garish,D: intelligent,E: annoying, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy thinks he is intelligent, but his attitudes are regressive, meaning he holds outdated, conservative beliefs. "Backward" means the opposite of progressive, which fits the context of the sentence. "Ignorant" could also fit the context, but it doesn't necessarily convey the idea of conservatism that is implied by "regressive." "Garish" and "annoying" are not related to the context of the sentence, and "intelligent" contradicts the idea that Billy's attitudes are regressive. Answer is
--target-- backward
--input-- Question: Where do people store cars when running errands? Options: A: at home,B: freeway,C: race track,D: parking lot,E: car show, Knowledge: The sentence implies that when people are out and about running errands, they need to store their cars somewhere temporarily. While it is possible they may store them at home or a race track, those options are not practical in the given context. Freeways are for driving on, not storing cars, and car shows are events where people display and admire cars, not store them while running errands. Therefore, the most logical choice is a parking lot, which is a designated space for temporarily storing vehicles. Answer is
--target-- parking lot
--input-- Question: If I had more than one steel pen (e.g. 100,000), where would I store it? Options: A: hand,B: warehouse,C: tv stand,D: back of farm,E: desk drawer, Knowledge: The question mentions having a large quantity of steel pens, which would require a larger storage space than a hand, desk drawer, TV stand, or farm.

Options: A: pleistocene,B: museum of natural history,C: smithsonian institution,D: antarctica,E: old times, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the teacher was discussing a prehistoric animal, the mammoth, and the time period in which it lived. The Pleistocene epoch is a well-known geological time period that lasted from about 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago and is associated with the rise and fall of many extinct animals, including mammoths. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- pleistocene
--input-- Question: If I wanted to find out the hours that Marmot was open, I might look where? Options: A: hiding place,B: ocean,C: high mountains,D: north america,E: yellow pages, Knowledge: The yellow pages are a traditional phone directory that lists businesses and their contact information, including their hours of operation. Therefore, if someone needed to find out the hours that a business, such as Marmot, is open, it would be logical to consult the yellow pages. The other options, such as a hiding place or the ocean, are unlikely places to find information about a business's hours. Answer is
--target-- yellow pages
--input-- Question: The back courtyard was common feature of every house in the neighborhood, where could they be found? Options: A: palace,B: poor suburbs,C: suburbs,D: country estate,E: large house, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the back courtyard is a common feature found in every house in the neighborhood. The options "palace" and "country estate" suggest expensive and luxurious properties, which would not be common features of every house in a neighborhood. "Poor suburbs" may not necessarily have back courtyards, and "large house" does not necessarily imply the presence of a back courtyard. Therefore, "suburbs" is the most likely correct choice as this is a common feature in neighborhoods of this nature. Answer is
--target-- suburbs
--input-- Question: John is bringing suit against Seth.   This problem has straight there relationship.  What might be increasing between them? Options: A: tensions,B: going to court,C: resentment,D: verdict,E: civility, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John and Seth have a problem, and John is taking legal action against Seth. The word "tensions" implies a rising level of conflict between the two parties, which is a likely outcome when one person sues another. The other options do not necessarily fit the context: "going to court" is already stated in the sentence, "resentment" may already exist and not necessarily increasing, "verdict" refers to a legal outcome and not a relationship dynamic, and "civility" is the opposite of tensions and not an appropriate answer in this context. Answer is
--target-- tensions
--input-- Question: Getting a gift you wanted for you birthday will cause what state? Options: A: disappointment,B: angry,C: then have,D: being happy,E: headaches, Knowledge: The verb "getting" combined with the noun "gift" suggests that the outcome of receiving a gift will be positive. The phrase "you wanted" reinforces this idea, indicating that the gift is desired and will likely bring joy. The other options, such as disappointment and anger, have negative connotations and do not fit with the context of receiving a desired gift. Headaches is also not a likely outcome of receiving a gift. Answer is
--target-- being happy
--input-- Question: James picked glass walls because they let more light into the room. Why did they let light in? Options: A: inventive,B: half empty,C: recyclable,D: clear,E: very fragile, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James chose glass walls because they allow more light into the room. This implies that the glass walls are transparent or clear so that light can pass through them. The other options, such as "inventive," "half empty," "recyclable," and "very fragile," do not have any relevance to the sentence and are not likely to be the reason why the glass walls let light in. Answer is
--target-- clear
--input-- Question: It could have been a beautiful day, but what did the overcast sky do to the color? Options: A: bee utiful,B: ugly,C: dull,D: plain,E: wet, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the sky affected the color in some way, indicating that the original beauty of the day may have been diminished. The word "overcast" also implies a lack of sunlight, which would further support the idea that the colors were not as vibrant as they could have been. "Dull" is the most appropriate choice as it accurately describes a loss of brightness or vibrancy, while the other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- dull
--input-- Question: Sam treasured his freedom.  When he became a POW, he tried to escape from what? Options: A: communism,B: oppression,C: slavery,D: bad marriage,E: captivity, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sam valued his ability to make his own decisions and do as he pleased, which is a common attribute associated with freedom. Being a prisoner of war would severely limit his freedoms, making the desire to escape a natural response. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- captivity
--input-- Question: What do fish have to aid in oxygen exchange? Options: A: gills,B: bones,C: tail,D: no legs,E: see work, Knowledge: Gills are the organs that enable fish to extract oxygen from water, so they are essential for their survival. Fish are not able to breathe air like land animals, which means that they must have specialized respiratory structures to extract oxygen from their watery environment. Bones, tail, and no legs are physical features of fish, but they are not directly related to oxygen exchange. "See work" is unrelated to the question. Answer is
--target-- gills
--input-- Question: After procreating what can't some people handle that makes them turn to the government?

The phrase "added responsibilities" is a common way to describe the challenges that come with having children, such as financial burdens, time constraints, and other lifestyle changes. The other options may also come with added responsibilities, but they are not directly connected to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- added responsibilities
--input-- Question: Where would you find an entrance hall that is used by a single family? Options: A: person,B: large building,C: school,D: house,E: mansion, Knowledge: The phrase "used by a single family" suggests that the entrance hall in question is part of a private residence rather than a public building or institution like a school or large building. The options "person" and "mansion" are more specific types of houses that could also have an entrance hall used by a single family. Answer is
--target-- house
--input-- Question: The guests were soon to arrive, she carefully arranged the cookies and set them out on a what? Options: A: jar,B: house,C: plate,D: mouth,E: hubcap, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is preparing for guests and has arranged cookies on something. It is common to arrange cookies on a plate when serving them to guests, which makes "plate" the most likely answer. The other options are unlikely because a jar may not be big enough or appropriate for cookies, a house is not a place to set out cookies, a mouth is not something to set out cookies on and a hubcap is not typically used for serving food. Answer is
--target-- plate
--input-- Question: Sean made a mistake on the test, but it wasn't an accident.  Why did he do it? Options: A: torment,B: success,C: correction,D: correct answer,E: on purpose, Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that Sean intentionally made a mistake on the test, ruling out options such as "accident" and "correction". The word "torment" does not seem appropriate in this context, and "success" and "correct answer" are unlikely to be the reasons for intentionally making a mistake on a test. Therefore, "on purpose" is the most appropriate answer. Answer is
--target-- on purpose

Options: A: think,B: nice keyboard,C: digital dexterity,D: speed,E: pressing keys, Knowledge: Typing involves the physical act of pressing keys on a keyboard to input letters and characters into a computer or other device.

Speed is also a desirable skill for typing, but it is still secondary to the primary action of pressing keys. Answer is
--target-- pressing keys

Options: A: possum,B: person's body,C: animal,D: organism,E: fingertips, Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about human nerves, which are found in the human body.

Options: A: continually,B: constantly,C: always forever,D: always,E: all day, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jim talked without pause, which indicates a continuous or uninterrupted pattern of speech. The word "constantly" is the best choice to describe this rate of talking, as it means without stopping or pausing.

"Being dirty" and "get messy" are not appropriate because they are not happening yet, and "get messy" may not necessarily be related to getting wet in the rain.

The option "anxious" could also be possible, but the word "frightening" is a stronger and more direct choice.

Options: A: change,B: gain knowledge,C: elation,D: headache,E: boredom, Knowledge: Learning about a subject is typically done with the goal of increasing one's understanding and knowledge in that area. The other options do not align with the typical motivations for learning, as "change" is too broad and could apply to any activity, while "elation" and "headache" are emotional states that are not direct outcomes of learning.

Options: A: trivial,B: minor,C: praising,D: eulogistic,E: unimportant, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject was critical of his own team while doing something else with the opponents.

Options: A: memorize,B: understand better,C: attend school,D: read book,E: church, Knowledge: The question implies that Bill is looking for a way to learn from a teacher, which makes attending school the most logical choice. While reading a book can also provide knowledge, it does not offer the opportunity to ask questions or receive personalized guidance, which Bill may desire. Memorizing or understanding better are actions that require prior knowledge or materials, which Bill may not have access to. Church may offer some educational opportunities, but attending school is a more direct and comprehensive way to learn. Answer is
--target-- attend school

Options: A: refrigerator,B: horses mouth,C: grocery store,D: desert,E: greengrocer, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person wants to buy food items, which suggests they should go to a place that sells groceries. The term "grocery store" specifically refers to a retail store that sells food and household items, making it the most relevant option among the choices. The other options, such as "refrigerator," "horse's mouth," "desert," and "greengrocer," do not make sense in this context. Answer is
--target-- grocery store

Answer is
--target-- louisiana

Of the options given, a cafe is the most likely location for this to happen, as cafes typically have menus and serve food and drink. The other options, such as a shop, internet site or advertisement, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

--input-- Question: The area between oceans and continents is very? Options: A: bridges,B: wide,C: salt water in,D: wet,E: very deep, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the area being referred to is located between two significant bodies of water (oceans) and land masses (continents). Therefore, it is more likely that the area is wide in extent rather than narrow or limited. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- wide
--input-- Question: The therapist said they needed to work on what, and that just talking to one another is the first step? Options: A: persuaded,B: communication,C: laughing,D: learn,E: friendship, Knowledge: The use of the word "talking" in the sentence suggests that the therapist is referring to the need for better communication between the individuals. The therapist is likely suggesting that the first step in improving their relationship is to talk and communicate effectively with one another. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- communication
--input-- Question: Where does food get digested? Options: A: stomach,B: pantry,C: inside,D: kitchen,E: plate, Knowledge: The process of digesting food begins in the mouth, where food is broken down by chewing and mixed with saliva. From there, it travels down the esophagus and into the stomach, where enzymes and acids break down the food further before it moves into the small intestine for absorption. The other options, such as pantry, kitchen, and plate, do not accurately refer to a part of the digestive system where food is processed. Answer is
--target-- stomach
--input-- Question: Where are you likely to find the freshest tomatoes? Options: A: pizza,B: squashed,C: refrigerator,D: market,E: on pizza, Knowledge: The word "fresh" implies that the tomatoes have not been stored for long periods of time, and instead have been recently harvested. Therefore, it is likely that the freshest tomatoes can be found at a market or farm stand, where they are sold shortly after being picked. The other options such as pizza, squashed or even the refrigerator do not guarantee fresh tomatoes, and the phrase "on pizza" is not a location where the tomatoes can be found but rather where they may be served. Answer is
--target-- market
--input-- Question: After standing in line all day what is likely to happen? Options: A: learn a new way to bake bread,B: order,C: tiredness,D: get tired,E: fidgeting, Knowledge: The sentence implies that standing in line all day can be physically exhausting. This makes "get tired" the most likely answer, as the other options do not relate to physical fatigue. "Learn a new way to bake bread" and "order" are not activities that typically result from standing in line for an extended period of time. "Tiredness" is very similar to "get tired" and may also be a suitable answer, but "get tired" is more specific in describing the action that is likely to occur. "Fidgeting" may be a result of being restless from standing in line for too long, but it does not describe the overall physical impact on the body. Answer is
--target-- get tired
--input-- Question: james wanted to fight inflation because he didn't like losing value when he did what? Options: A: more money,B: save money,C: can,D: costs money,E: pay less, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is concerned about losing value when he does something specific. This implies that James is experiencing inflation, which is causing the value of his money to decrease over time. The best option among the choices is "save money" because saving money allows James to preserve its value, even in the face of inflation. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not address the issue of inflation. Answer is
--target-- save money

Options: A: hen house,B: in a cornfield,C: storybook,D: natural habitat,E: dense forest, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the fox saw itself wearing silly clothes on a piece of paper, which likely indicates that the fox was looking at a representation of itself in a printed or drawn medium.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- storybook

The options "paint house," "compete against," "tell many people about," and "pass class" do not have any clear relationship to the context of feeling pride after improving one's mile time. Answer is
--target-- improve yourself
--input-- Question: Nate washed  his personal silverware and put it in a  drawer.   Where might that drawer be? Options: A: bedroom,B: kitchen,C: table,D: restaurant,E: cupboard, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Nate washed his personal silverware and put it away in a place where it would be easily accessible for future use. The most logical location for this would be the kitchen, where plates, glasses, and other utensils are typically stored. The other options (bedroom, table, restaurant, and cupboard) are less likely to be the location of where Nate stored his silverware. Answer is
--target-- kitchen
--input-- Question: The bookshop specializes in course texts, where is it located? Options: A: mall,B: sea shore,C: shopping center,D: student union,E: department store, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the bookshop specializes in course texts, which are typically used by students. The option "student union" is the most relevant choice because it is a common gathering place for students on a college or university campus, and would therefore be a natural location for a bookshop specializing in course texts. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- student union
--input-- Question: Where would you likely find a laser in a university? Options: A: cd players,B: laboratory,C: aircraft,D: hospital,E: cdrom drive, Knowledge: A laser is commonly used in scientific and research settings, such as in laboratory experiments for physics, chemistry, and engineering.

--input-- Question: Having to fight inflation brings a lot of this sentiment to the public? Options: A: poverty,B: higher interest rates,C: saving money,D: not very much,E: dissatisfaction, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that fighting inflation has a negative impact on the public, which is likely to lead to a feeling of dissatisfaction.

--target-- dissatisfaction
--input-- Question: What can you do if you're fiddling on violin? Options: A: dancing about,B: bluegrass music,C: make music,D: playing,E: drop, Knowledge: The verb "fiddling" typically refers to playing the violin, so the most appropriate answer in this context would be "make music". Dancing about, bluegrass music, and drop are not related to the act of playing the violin. While "playing" is technically correct, it is not as specific or contextual as "make music" in this sentence. Answer is
--target-- make music
--input-- Question: An evening of remembering often leads to what? Options: A: knowledge,B: remembrance,C: nostalgia,D: problems,E: knowing, Knowledge: The phrase "evening of remembering" suggests a time of reflecting on the past, which often leads to nostalgia. Nostalgia refers to a sentimental longing for the past, which is a common feeling when remembering past events or experiences. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to the act of remembering or reflecting on the past. Answer is
--target-- nostalgia
--input-- Question: James installed his new curtains to keep the light from shinning on his television.  Where is James probably hanging his curtains? Options: A: show,B: grocery store,C: department store,D: house,E: theater, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James installed curtains in his own personal space in order to block out light from a particular source, which is likely his television. Therefore, it is most likely that he hung his curtains in his own house rather than at a show, grocery store, department store, or theater which would not be his personal space. Answer is
--target-- house
--input-- Question: The weather was nice, but Sean didn't count on that. He knew it could do what? Options: A: look beautiful,B: storm for days,C: change quickly,D: start raining,E: surprise us, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sean was not counting on the weather to stay nice because he knew it could change quickly. This implies that the weather in the area is known to be unpredictable and prone to sudden shifts in conditions. The other options either do not fit with the context of the sentence or are not supported by any information provided. Answer is
--target-- change quickly
--input-- Question: If you do not have a bean, where would you go to get one? Options: A: cooking pot,B: coffee,C: beantown,D: neighbor,E: food store, Knowledge: The question suggests that the context is related to obtaining a bean as an ingredient for cooking or consumption. While some of the options such as cooking pot, coffee, and beantown are associated with beans, they do not provide a clear solution to obtaining a bean when you don't have one. Neighbor may seem like a viable option, but it is not the best solution as it may not be practical to ask for a bean from a neighbor. The most practical and obvious option is to go to a food store where you can purchase a bean. Answer is
--target-- food store
--input-- Question: What type of exertion do you utilize when hiking? Options: A: mountain,B: physical exertion,C: adventure,D: exercise,E: shin splints, Knowledge: Hiking is a physically demanding activity that requires a lot of energy and effort. The word "utilize" in the question suggests that the answer is a type of action or process, rather than a specific location or condition. "Mountain" and "adventure" are not types of exertion, while "exercise" is too broad and could apply to any physical activity. "Shin splints" is a condition that can result from hiking, but it is not a type of exertion itself. Therefore, "physical exertion" is the most appropriate answer. Answer is
--target-- physical exertion
--input-- Question: They decided to employ prisoners to dig lines to help fight the what? Options: A: fire,B: work for,C: sack,D: lay off,E: make redundant, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that prisoners were employed to do a specific task that would be helpful in fighting something. The options "work for," "sack," "lay off," and "make redundant" do not make sense in this context. "Fire" is the only choice that fits with the idea of fighting something, and digging lines can be a technique used to contain or control a fire. Answer is
--target-- fire
--input-- Question: A student takes an unpaid membership, why on Earth would he do that? Options: A: gain experience,B: taking notes,C: listen carefully,D: study book,E: capitalist exploitation, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the student took an unpaid membership for a reason. One possible reason for taking an unpaid membership is to gain experience in a particular field (e.g. volunteer work). Taking notes and studying books do not necessarily require a membership, and capitalist exploitation does not make sense in this context. "Listen carefully" might be a plausible option, but it is less likely than "gain experience" given the word choice in the sentence. Answer is
--target-- gain experience
--input-- Question: What might I use if I want to give a grape as a gift? Options: A: kitchen,B: bowl of fruit,C: box,D: field,E: fruit basket, Knowledge: The question is asking for a suitable container for giving a grape as a gift. Out of the options provided, a fruit basket would be the most appropriate choice for presenting a single grape as a gift. A kitchen or field would not be suitable containers, and a bowl of fruit may be too large or contain other items that could detract from the singular grape as a gift. A box could be an option, but a fruit basket would add a decorative touch to the gift presentation. Answer is
--target-- fruit basket
--input-- Question: Where would you find an expensive lantern? Options: A: a collector's house,B: dark place,C: house,D: antique shop,E: street, Knowledge: The word "expensive" suggests that the lantern is valuable and therefore likely to be sold in a location that specializes in selling expensive or rare items. An antique shop fits this description as it typically sells vintage and valuable items. The other options, such as a collector's house or a dark place, do not necessarily imply that the lantern is expensive, and therefore are less likely to be the correct answer. Answer is
--target-- antique shop
--input-- Question: What would a sick person do to recover? Options: A: take medicine,B: throw up,C: exercise,D: battle cancer,E: get better, Knowledge: Taking medicine is a common method for treating illnesses and recovering from sickness. On the other hand, throwing up and exercising may not always be recommended or effective methods for recovery. Battling cancer requires a combination of treatments and a longer period of time compared to a regular illness, which makes it an unlikely choice for this question. Finally, "get better" is not a concrete action or method that a sick person can take to actively aid in their recovery. Answer is
--target-- take medicine
--input-- Question: John was was looking for a shirt, so he pulled open this.  What did John pull open? Options: A: closet,B: chest,C: drawer,D: dresser,E: suitcase, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John was searching for a shirt, which is an item of clothing typically kept in a drawer. The other options - closet, chest, dresser, and suitcase - may also contain clothing but are less commonly associated with storing shirts specifically. It is important to consider the context and associations of each option to make an informed choice. Answer is
--target-- drawer
--input-- Question: The automaton wanted to save money like normal humans, what did it need to learn about? Options: A: museum,B: banking,C: science fiction plot,D: lab,E: computer work, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the automaton wants to save money like normal humans, which indicates that it needs to learn about a financial system. Banking is a logical choice because it refers to the system of conducting financial transactions, such as depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds, that is commonly used by humans. The other options, such as museum or science fiction plot, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- banking
--input-- Question: Sometimes it seems like government wants to control anything and what? Options: A: washington d.c,B: everything,C: all of us,D: country,E: capitol building, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the government has a tendency to impose control on various aspects of society or individuals, hence the word "anything." The other options don't fit, as they're either specific places (Washington D.C.) or too general (country and all of us) and don't provide the same level of specificity as "everything." Answer is
--target-- everything
--input-- Question: What is typical of a person with blemish free, flowing skin? Options: A: finger,B: makeup,C: body,D: own family,E: good health, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having blemish-free, flowing skin is a characteristic commonly associated with good health.

--input-- Question: What does a policeman patrol? Options: A: street,B: coffee,C: freeway,D: donut shop,E: police station, Knowledge: Policemen are typically responsible for patrolling specific areas, such as neighborhoods or business districts.

--target-- street

Options: A: basement,B: hotel,C: garage,D: guest room,E: horseradish, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the individuals are hosting guests and apologizing for the sleeping accommodations. This suggests that there is a designated guest room in the house, and that the sofa bed is a temporary solution for extra guests. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a basement, garage, or hotel would not typically have a sofa bed for guests, and horseradish is not related to the topic at all. Answer is
--target-- guest room
--input-- Question: How can the shape of wood be changed? Options: A: nailed,B: grind,C: carved,D: polished,E: warp, Knowledge: The question is asking about how the shape of wood can be changed. Nailing usually does not change the shape of the wood but only attaches it to another piece of wood. Grinding and polishing can shape and smooth the surface of wood, but not its overall shape. Warping refers to the wood bending or twisting due to changes in humidity or temperature. Carving, however, refers to the act of removing pieces of wood to alter its shape, making it the correct answer to the question. Answer is
--target-- carved
--input-- Question: What might learning about science cause in someone? Options: A: scientific knowledge,B: intimidation,C: boring,D: become educated,E: sense of wonder, Knowledge: The question is asking about the potential effect of learning about science. One possible outcome is that it can inspire a "sense of wonder" as someone learns about the amazing complexity and interconnectivity of the natural world. This option is supported by the fact that science often reveals new and fascinating phenomena that can inspire awe and curiosity. The other options (scientific knowledge, intimidation, boring, become educated) are all possible outcomes of learning about science, but they do not necessarily capture the emotional response to this knowledge. Answer is
--target-- sense of wonder
--input-- Question: Cats are looking longingly at an aquarium, what are they looking to do? Options: A: like heat,B: play,C: eating fish,D: drink water,E: come to dinner, Knowledge: The context of the sentence mentions that there is an aquarium, which is likely to have fish in it. Since cats are natural predators and often hunt fish in the wild, it is likely that they are looking to eat the fish in the aquarium. The other options like heat, play, drink water, and come to dinner do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
--target-- eating fish
--input-- Question: Where would you find people sleeping in a chair waiting for a vehicle to arrive? Options: A: airport,B: floor,C: bedroom,D: desk,E: bus station, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are waiting for a vehicle to arrive, which is a common occurrence in airports where people wait for their flights or for someone to pick them up. People may sleep in a chair due to long layovers or delays, and this is a common image associated with airports. The other options, such as bedroom or desk, do not have any clear connection to people sleeping in chairs while waiting for a vehicle. Answer is
--target-- airport
--input-- Question: What can be the end result of waging war? Options: A: people dying,B: heartache,C: killing people,D: evil,E: suffering, Knowledge: Waging war often involves violent conflict and the use of weapons, which can result in the death of individuals involved in the fighting. This is a common and well-known consequence of war, whereas heartache, evil, and suffering are more abstract concepts that may be associated with war but do not directly describe a tangible result. Killing people is also a possible consequence of war, but it is more specific than people dying and may not always occur in every war. Answer is
--target-- people dying
--input-- Question: While some people prefer to lie, others do prefer to bluntly what? Options: A: amount to nothing,B: talk louder,C: talking loudly,D: talk to each other,E: state facts, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are two different approaches to communicating, with one preferring to lie and the other preferring to do something that is the opposite of lying. The last option, "state facts", aligns with this opposite approach, as stating facts is typically associated with being honest and straightforward. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence and are not opposites of lying. Answer is
--target-- state facts
--input-- Question: Where would I go to see the most brands of oboe? Options: A: orchestra,B: case,C: guitar center,D: band,E: music store, Knowledge: The question is asking where you can find the most variety of oboe brands, so the most likely place to find a wide selection would be a music store. Orchestras and bands may have oboes, but they would typically only have a few select brands for their players to use. A case is not a location where oboes are sold, and Guitar Center is a store that specializes in guitars and other stringed instruments, so it is less likely to have a large selection of oboes. Answer is
--target-- music store
--input-- Question: Where would you put a sealed drink if you want to bring it with you? Options: A: cup,B: cabinet,C: cardboard box,D: stumble,E: backpack, Knowledge: The question suggests that the drink needs to be transported from one location to another, which indicates that it should be placed in a container that can be carried easily. Of the options given, only 'backpack' fits this criteria as it is a type of bag that can be used to carry items. The other options - cup, cabinet, cardboard box, and stumble - do not seem like practical choices for storing a drink during transportation. Answer is
--target-- backpack

Options: A: baked biscuits,B: make progress,C: make haste,D: take time,E: make trouble, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action being described has a negative impact on someone else's life. Baking biscuits or making progress are unlikely to have negative consequences for someone else. Making haste or taking time may affect one's own life but not necessarily someone else's. "Making trouble" is the only option that implies the action makes life harder for someone else. Answer is
--target-- make trouble
--input-- Question: What place in the US has a lot of mines? Options: A: ground,B: cambodia,C: mine craft  game,D: pennsylvania,E: mountain, Knowledge: The question specifically asks about a place in the US with a lot of mines. Knowing that mines are typically associated with extraction of natural resources like coal, oil, and minerals, it is reasonable to eliminate options like ground, cambodia, and mine craft game. Additionally, mountains are often associated with mining activities, but may not necessarily have a lot of mines. Pennsylvania, on the other hand, has a strong history of coal mining, making it a likely answer choice. Answer is
--target-- pennsylvania

Options: A: jewellers,B: guard tower,C: department store,D: police station,E: bedroom drawer, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Billy stole a cheap item, which is commonly found in department stores. Jewellers typically sell high-priced items such as gold, diamonds and precious stones. The guard tower and police station are unlikely places where watches would be sold.

--target-- department store

Options: A: bike path,B: schoolyard,C: netherlands,D: street,E: university, Knowledge: The question is asking where the person can ride their bike in order to take graduate classes, implying that they want to ride their bike to a location where they can attend classes. The options "schoolyard" and "street" do not necessarily suggest a location where one can attend classes. "Netherlands" is a country and therefore does not provide a specific location. "Bike path" may suggest a route to take, but does not indicate a specific destination for taking classes. "University" is the best answer because it directly relates to attending classes and is a common location for graduate studies. Answer is
--target-- university

Options: A: bar,B: sporting event,C: internet cafe,D: garage sale,E: hockey game, Knowledge: The sentence implies that the scene is taking place in a location where glass is present and that there are people causing a disturbance nearby.

--input-- Question: The comforter was a favorite for cuddling in front of the TV, where did the family put it? Options: A: outside,B: washing machine,C: cedar chest,D: bedroom,E: livingroom, Knowledge: The context suggests that the comforter was used for snuggling in front of the TV, which is an activity typically done in a living room or family room setting. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. The washing machine would be used to clean the comforter, the cedar chest would be used for storage or display purposes, and outside and bedroom are unlikely options for a cuddling blanket. Answer is
--target-- livingroom

--input-- Question: Government, planned cities, workers, institutions, technology and record keeping are characteristics of what among human populations? Options: A: country,B: civilization,C: citizen,D: canada,E: city, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the listed characteristics are associated with a particular type of human population. The options "country" and "city" are too broad and do not encompass all of the listed characteristics. "Canada" and "citizen" are specific to a country, and are not related to the context of the sentence. "Civilization," on the other hand, is commonly used to describe a society with advanced institutions, technologies, and a system of record-keeping. Planned cities and workers are also commonly associated with civilizations. Therefore, the correct answer is "civilization." Answer is

--input-- Question: Where can one find a singing human? Options: A: band,B: aircraft,C: outer-space,D: space shuttle,E: factory, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the singing human is likely part of a musical group or ensemble.

Options: A: canada,B: roof,C: mountains,D: ground,E: ground, Knowledge: The mention of snow suggests that the tourist was likely in a colder climate or area that experiences snowfall. The options of Canada and mountains both fit this description, as Canada is known for its cold winters and mountainous regions also commonly experience snow. The option of roof doesn't make sense in the context of capturing pictures of snow, and the repetition of ground as an option is likely an error. Answer is
--target-- mountains
--input-- Question: What often happens to the remembering of people who are stressed? Options: A: knowledge,B: problems,C: difficult,D: nostalgia,E: depression, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people who are stressed tend to have issues with remembering things.

--input-- Question: It wasn't for a lack of effort they didn't finish the job, they just didn't have what supplies? Options: A: possessing,B: plethora,C: enough,D: satisfaction,E: availability, Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the reason the job was not finished was not due to a lack of effort but rather a lack of something else. The word "enough" suggests that the supplies may have been insufficient to complete the job. "Possessing" does not fit the context of the sentence as it refers to ownership rather than availability. "Plethora" suggests an abundance of supplies, which contradicts the idea that the job was not completed due to a lack of supplies. "Satisfaction" does not fit the context of the sentence as it does not relate to the completion of the job. "Availability" supports the idea that the supplies were not accessible or present, but "enough" is a better fit because it indicates that even if the supplies were available, they were not sufficient to complete the job. Answer is
--target-- enough
--input-- Question: James crushed his paper coffee cup and then left it in its proper place.  Where might he have left it? Options: A: coffee,B: desk,C: starbucks,D: cupboard,E: trash, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James disposed of his paper coffee cup after crushing it, which means he must have put it in a bin or bin-like container. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence, as leaving a crushed cup on a coffee table or desk, putting it in a cupboard, or leaving it at Starbucks would not be considered its "proper place." Answer is
--target-- trash

Minerals are naturally occurring substances found on Earth, so it makes sense that the correct answer is Earth. The other options, such as Nebraska, multivitamin, and Michigan, do not have any association with minerals or the context of the sentence. The word "ore" is associated with minerals, but it is too vague on its own and could refer to any planet or even asteroids or moons. Answer is
--target-- earth
--input-- Question: Where are people likely to sing? Options: A: apartment,B: supermarket,C: train station,D: opera,E: conference, Knowledge: The word "opera" refers to a type of musical theater that features singing as its primary mode of expression.

Options: A: happiness,B: minimize own suffering,C: victory in war,D: understood,E: sadness, Knowledge: The sentence suggests that although people have different desires in life, there is something common that they all ultimately seek. The phrase "a little bit of" may indicate that this is something relatively small or subtle.

The sentence suggests that the hamburgers were served at a fast food restaurant, so options such as "hockey game" are unlikely choices. "Cooked on grill" is a general description rather than a specific location, leaving "Burger King" as the most logical answer. Answer is
--target-- burger king

Options: A: make love,B: get married,C: gone to jail,D: have children,E: learning, Knowledge: Getting married is a common way to start living life with someone else and forming a committed relationship.

Options: A: good for,B: wash,C: starve,D: lose weight,E: fibre, Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the doctor gave the man dietary advice, specifically to eat vegetables. The phrase "it would help him" implies that the doctor advised the man to eat vegetables for a specific purpose. The option "good for" is too generic and could apply to any number of health benefits associated with vegetables. "Wash" and "starve" do not make sense in this context.
