[CLS] Standing in line is made more difficult by what? fidgeting [SEP] Knowledge: The sentence suggests that standing in line is a difficult experience and there is likely to be some form of physical discomfort associated with it. The choice "tiredness" is the most fitting, as standing in line can cause fatigue or weariness over time, making it more difficult to maintain one's position in line. The other choices (fidgeting, pain, and cars) either do not make sense in the context of the sentence or do not relate to the physical discomfort associated with standing in line.

[CLS] What could happen when beginning work after it is too late? panic [SEP] Knowledge: The sentence suggests that starting work after it is too late can have negative consequences, which may cause someone to feel panicked. Deadlines may also be a consequence of starting work too late, but the sentence specifically mentions what could happen as a result of beginning work late. Accomplishing and momentum are not negative consequences, and sitting down does not relate to the context of the sentence.

[CLS] What happens if you eat hamburger that's very big? hungry [SEP] Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if you eat a very big hamburger, you will experience a certain outcome. One likely outcome is that you will feel full, since the hamburger is likely to fill up your stomach. The other options do not make logical sense or have any clear connection to the context of the sentence.

[CLS] Where might a student store a pencil when traveling backpack [SEP] Knowledge: The question is about where a student might store a pencil while traveling, which suggests that the answer should be a portable, convenient option. A backpack is a common choice for students to carry their school supplies in, especially when traveling or on the go. The other options, such as desktop or desk drawer, are stationary and not suitable for traveling. Pocket may be an option, but it depends on the size of the pencil and the type of clothing being worn, which adds uncertainty to the answer.

Some weights of the model checkpoint at roberta-large were not used when initializing RobertaForMultipleChoice: ['lm_head.dense.bias', 'lm_head.layer_norm.weight', 'lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.bias', 'lm_head.decoder.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing RobertaForMultipleChoice from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing RobertaForMultipleChoice from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of RobertaForMultipleChoice were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-large and are newly initialized: ['classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
