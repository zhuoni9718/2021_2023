Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking about where to acquire an action figure. The options "eat cake," "theater," and "bathtub" do not provide a plausible answer to this question, as they are not places where one would typically find or purchase an action figure.

Question: Where might a child go who has no home? Options: A: school,B: orphanage,C: most homes,D: recreational,E: pen,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the child in question does not have a home. Therefore, it is likely that the child would go to a place that provides shelter, such as an orphanage.

orphanage

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the crabs are moving along the bottom of some type of body of water. The options "fish market" and "aquarium" do not fit the context of the sentence, as crabs in those locations would not typically be crawling along the bottom of anything. "Saltwater" is a possibility, but it is too broad and does not provide enough specificity. "Galapagos" is also too specific and does not fit the general context of the sentence, which suggests that the crabs could be in any body of water. Therefore, the correct answer is "bodies of water." Answer is
bodies of water

A fruit market, on the other hand, specifically suggests a place where fruits are sold, often directly by the growers themselves. Answer is
fruit market

two hands

The refrigerator is used to keep condiments fresh and safe to consume over a longer period of time, but they may not be easily accessible if they are chilled. A container could be used to hold condiments but is not specific to the context of the question, whereas the table is the most common location for placing condiments within reach during meals.

The use of the word "unique" suggests that this feature was unusual or unexpected. The option "square shape" makes the most sense in this context, as traditional rooms are typically square or rectangular in shape. The other options ("possessions in," "high walls," "doors and windows," and "triangles") do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Flatulence can happen, but it is not a commonly experienced effect of eating dinner. Answer is

The options "grocery store" and "table" are unlikely because they suggest a public space or a communal area, whereas the sentence implies that the flour was being kept in a private household.

The other options, such as television and computer, do not typically use an oscilloscope for their display. Answer is

Knowledge: The question implies that there is a consequence for not signing a contract. Typically, if a contract is not signed, it is considered incomplete and therefore invalid. That means it can be rejected, as it lacks the necessary signature(s) to make it legally enforceable. The other options do not make sense in this context - "dumb" is slang and unrelated, "written on paper" is obvious and not a consequence, "signed" is the opposite of what is being discussed, and "revised" implies that the contract has already been changed or edited, which is not mentioned in the question. Answer is
rejected

Knowledge: The combination of cord, nails, and bolts suggests that this is a location where hardware or DIY supplies are sold. The delivery room, sporting goods store, and office do not typically stock these items, so they can be eliminated. The garage could be a possibility, but it is not a specific enough answer - many different types of items could be stored in a garage. Therefore, the best choice is the hardware store, as this is where one would expect to find all three of these items together. Answer is
hardware store

The most likely place for a dog to be confined would be a backyard since it allows the dog some room to move around while still being enclosed. The other options - kitchen cupboard, front door, table, and park - do not make sense in the context of the sentence as they do not provide a suitable place for a dog to be confined. Answer is
backyard
Question: The magician guessed it was a king, he was very good with a what? Options: A: hierarchy,B: court,C: chess game,D: deck of cards,E: chess set,.

The choices "hierarchy" and "court" are less likely to be linked to such a guess. Additionally, the term "game" is used twice in the sentence, suggesting that the answer may be related to a game. The options "chess game" and "chess set" are related to chess, but the magician may not necessarily have been good at chess. Thus, the most appropriate option would be "deck of cards" as this is a game commonly associated with magicians and guessing games. Answer is
deck of cards

Answer is
turn left

Knowledge: Bald eagles are known to live in areas with access to bodies of water, as they primarily feed on fish. Rural areas can offer ample access to both water and undisturbed natural habitats, making them a more likely location to spot a wild bald eagle. The other options, such as painting, zoo, and aviary, do not offer live views of a bald eagle in a natural setting.

The other options, such as throwing up or stumbling, do not logically connect to the context of the sentence. Answer is

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
lead pencil

This suggests that the answer is a universal goal or desire. We can eliminate options like "sad" and "cat" because they are not something people actively strive for. "Grow old" is a natural process that happens to everyone, but not necessarily something they try to achieve. "Believed" does not make sense in this context. This leaves us with "happy," which is a common goal for people, suggesting that it is the correct answer. Answer is

While some homes may have large wooden doors, it is less common than in castles.

"Every building" is too broad of a category and cannot be inferred from the question. Answer is

Question: What is the best course of action for a person to take if they want to get up early? Options: A: go to bed early,B: fix up alarm,C: go sleep early,D: dawn,E: ask spouse to wake,. Knowledge: Getting up early requires going to bed early as well so that the body can have enough rest and energy for the day ahead. Fixing an alarm can only remind a person to wake up, but it does not guarantee that they will have the energy to start their day. "Go sleep early" is not a grammatically correct option, and "dawn" is not a practical solution as it is not an action that a person can take. Asking a spouse to wake a person up can put unnecessary pressure on the spouse and may not be reliable. Therefore, the best course of action for a person to take if they want to get up early is to go to bed early. Answer is
go to bed early

department store
Question: Where can you take your kids to buy things for them to play with? Options: A: disneyland,B: jungle,C: swimming pool,D: toy store,E: home,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a place to buy toys for their kids to play with. Disneyland and the jungle are not typically associated with buying toys, while a swimming pool is a place to swim rather than buy toys. Home is also an unlikely option as the sentence implies that the speaker wants to take their kids somewhere to buy toys.

Sleeping or going to bed are not appropriate options as they are not practical in the moment. Running would only make the situation worse.

Sitting down is the most appropriate option as it will allow the person to rest their legs and take a break from standing or walking. Answer is
sit down
Question: What happens to most people after playing tennis all day? Options: A: championship,B: becoming tired,C: tennis elbow,D: victory,E: friends,.

Rainy days are often associated with thunderstorms and lightning, making it the most likely choice.

Remorse, which means deep regret or guilt for a wrong committed, is the most appropriate choice among the options considering the context of the sentence.

Question: John tried his best to care for Kate, but Kate kept throwing herself into danger.  He couldn't stand her what for her own safety? Options: A: unfeeling,B: disregard,C: indifferent,D: neglect,E: apathetic,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite John's efforts to care for Kate, she repeatedly put herself in danger. The word that fits best in the blank should convey a lack of concern for her own safety, which is indicated by the fact that she kept putting herself in harm's way. The options "neglect" and "apathetic" also convey a lack of care, but "disregard" is a better fit in the context of the sentence. The options "unfeeling" and "indifferent" do not necessarily imply a lack of concern for safety, and so are not the best choices. Answer is
disregard

Punching someone is a common physical response when someone is angry and feels out of control. The other options do not align with this context - destroying an enemy, writing letters, and illustrating points are all more strategic or intellectual responses rather than physical ones. Cooling off is a more neutral option, but it doesn't necessarily suggest any action or behavior on Matt's part. Answer is
punch

This approach may have alienated potential customers or made it difficult for them to understand what the cafe was all about. The sentence also suggests that the competitor took a different approach that allowed them to succeed, and since the other choices all suggest some form of alignment with the hipster approach, the correct answer is conventional, which suggests a more straightforward and traditional approach that is more likely to appeal to a wider range of customers.

Knowledge: The question is asking for the best place to store a ballpoint pen, which implies that it is a long-term storage location rather than a temporary one. The other answer choices don't seem like logical locations for long-term storage of a pen. A pocket could lead to loss or damage, a stationery store is where one would buy the pen, a backpack is a transportation method, and a bank has no clear connection to pen storage. Therefore, a desk drawer, where one would store office supplies, seems to be the most appropriate choice. Answer is
desk drawer

Answer is

The phrase "over and over" implies that the dog does this for a long period of time, suggesting that eventually, it will become tired. The other options, such as "ball stopped" and "fall and hurt yourself," do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Breathing" is a natural process and doesn't have any clear connection to the dog's activity, while "catching" is already implied in the first part of the sentence (i.e. the dog loves to run after the ball). Answer is
get tired

Question: Where is a market likely to be enclosed? Options: A: field,B: village,C: rural area,D: city,E: mexico,. Knowledge: Enclosed markets are typically found in urban or city areas where there is limited space and a high concentration of people. In contrast, fields and rural areas are more likely to have open-air markets, and villages may have a mix of both. Mexico is a country and therefore is not a likely location for an enclosed market without specifying a city or region. Answer is
city
Question: He watched the team play every Sunday, but this was the first time the fan would enter a what to see a snap live? Options: A: football stadium,B: hot room,C: hockey game,D: living room,E: basketball court,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the fan has been watching the team play on Sundays, suggesting that the team likely plays a sport that is typically played on Sundays, such as football. The sentence also mentions the fan seeing a snap "live," which implies that they will be physically present at the game, ruling out options like a living room where they might watch a game on television. Finally, the phrase "enter a" suggests that they will be entering a specific space, further supporting the idea that the answer is a football stadium rather than a general location like a basketball court. Answer is
football stadium
Question: Where would you not be able to find a radio studio? Options: A: office building,B: college,C: broadcasting music,D: large city,E: clear area,. Knowledge: The question is asking for a location where a radio studio would not be found. An office building or college may have a radio studio as part of their communication or media departments. Broadcasting music could refer to a radio station, which would obviously have a radio studio. Large cities are likely to have multiple radio stations, each with their own studio. However, a clear area does not suggest any kind of building or infrastructure, making it the unlikely option where a radio studio could be found. Answer is
clear area
Question: As the round object rolls down the ramp it will what? Options: A: sound well,B: fly,C: become broken,D: gain speed,E: fall into hole,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the round object is rolling down a ramp, and the question asks what will happen to it. One common physical phenomenon associated with a rolling object on a slope is that it gains speed as it moves downhill due to gravity. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
gain speed
Question: He would entertain with a pool party regularly, it was the best way to beat the what? Options: A: please,B: hot,C: guest,D: bribe,E: liked,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the pool party was a way to "beat" something, suggesting that it was a solution to a problem. It then goes on to describe the party as a way to "entertain," implying that it was a social event. Together, these clues suggest that the problem being "beaten" is something related to discomfort or discomfort caused by heat. Therefore, the correct answer is "hot." The other options do not make sense in this context. Answer is
hot
Question: If I go outside and look down, what will I find outside? Options: A: ground,B: sun,C: nature,D: sky,E: street,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if the speaker goes outside and looks down, they are likely to see the ground. The other options (sun, sky, nature) are all located higher up in the sky and would not necessarily be visible by looking downwards. The option "street" could potentially be a correct answer if the speaker is standing on a street or sidewalk, but the phrasing of the sentence suggests that they are simply stepping outside and looking down. Answer is
ground
Question: What happens to your car when you're driving to work? Options: A: get to work,B: stress,C: use gas,D: speeding ticket,E: get depreciation,. Knowledge: The question is asking about what happens to your car when you're driving to work. Since driving requires fuel to power the engine, the most likely answer is "use gas." The other options don't necessarily relate to the act of driving, but rather the consequences of it (i.e. getting to work, feeling stressed, receiving a speeding ticket, or experiencing depreciation over time). Answer is
use gas
Question: Regular pants are sometimes not long enough if a person is very what? Options: A: goofy,B: tall,C: constipated,D: abnormal,E: new,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that regular pants may not fit properly if a person is very something, and one of the choices that fits this context is "tall." Being tall means having a greater height than average, and this could result in pants being too short. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
tall
Question: John cared for Sally, but Sally couldn't return his feelings. She only felt what? Options: A: unfeeling,B: being mean,C: field,D: disinterest,E: negligence,. Knowledge: The sentence states that Sally cannot return John's feelings, suggesting that she does not have romantic interest in him. "Disinterest" means a lack of interest or enthusiasm, which fits with Sally's feelings towards John. The other options, such as "being mean" or "negligence," do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. Answer is
disinterest
Question: They were very careful transporting the holy artifact, the last thing they wanted to do was deliver it what? Options: A: profane,B: common,C: halibut,D: broken,E: damaged,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the holy artifact is fragile and requires careful handling. The word "transporting" suggests that the object is being moved from one location to another, further emphasizing the importance of preventing any damage during the journey. The option "halibut" is completely unrelated and can be eliminated. While "profane" and "common" may be opposite in meaning to "holy," neither of them indicates that the object is fragile or requires careful handling. "Broken" is a possibility, but "damaged" is a more general term that covers a wider range of potential harm. Answer is
damaged
Question: Where is a tin likely to be stored? Options: A: shopping bag,B: kitchen,C: hardware store,D: grocery store,E: cupboard,. Knowledge: Tin is often used to package and store food items such as canned goods, which are commonly kept in cupboards or cabinets in the kitchen. The other options do not make sense for storing tin as they are not typically associated with food storage or packaging. Answer is
cupboard
Question: They were worried about the fruit staying fresh in the heat, so they put it in the what? Options: A: san francisco,B: refrigerator,C: gay bar,D: container,E: plate,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that there is a concern about the fruit staying fresh in the heat. The most logical solution for this problem would be to put the fruit in a place where it can remain cool and preserved, such as a refrigerator. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
refrigerator
Question: On what would you serve an egg to someone? Options: A: chicken coop,B: henhouse,C: plate,D: glass cup,E: bird's nest,. Knowledge: It is customary to serve eggs on a plate for human consumption. The other options, such as a chicken coop or bird's nest, are not realistic choices for serving eggs to people. While a henhouse is where chickens live, it is not where one would serve food to someone. A glass cup is not a suitable dish for serving eggs, unless perhaps they are going to be used in a mixed drink or cocktail. Answer is
plate
Question: Where can you get a french horn to take home with you? Options: A: concert,B: music class,C: concert hall,D: france,E: music store,. Knowledge: The question is asking where you can acquire a French horn to take home, which suggests that the answer must relate to purchasing or borrowing the instrument. Of the options given, the only one that could reasonably involve buying or renting a French horn is a music store. The other options all relate to attending events or classes, which is not necessarily related to acquiring an instrument. Also, the option 'France' is misleading because it states the name of the country as an option, whereas the correct answer would be a store in France. Answer is
music store
Question: The roommates were young and irresponsible, it was always a mess at their what? Options: A: apartment,B: table,C: office,D: desk,E: closet,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the roommates are young and irresponsible, which suggests that they may not have good cleaning habits or keep a tidy living space. An apartment is a common living space for roommates, and the other options such as table, office, desk, and closet do not have the same connotation of being a shared residential space that is prone to becoming messy. Answer is
apartment
Question: What do criminals do when they are caught? Options: A: they feel happy,B: realise error of ways,C: take money,D: serving time,E: arm themselves,. Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of being caught as a criminal. "Serving time" refers to the punishment of being sentenced to a certain amount of time in jail or prison. The other options do not make sense in this context - a criminal would not feel happy about being caught or take money (which would be considered theft) and arming themselves would only lead to further trouble with the law. "Realising error of ways" is a possible answer, but it is not a specific consequence that is always associated with being caught as a criminal. Answer is
serving time
Question: What is likely to be a long term negative consequence of of over eating hamburger? Options: A: gaining weight,B: stomach ache,C: get full,D: losing weight,E: death,. Knowledge: Overeating generally leads to an increase in calorie intake, which can cause a person to gain weight over time. Hamburger, being a high-calorie food, when overeaten, can cause a significant weight gain. A stomach ache is a more immediate consequence that may occur after eating a lot of hamburger, but it is not necessarily a long-term consequence. Getting full is a normal response to eating and is not negative. Losing weight is the opposite of the expected consequence of overeating hamburger. Death is an extreme consequence that is not relevant to the context of the question. Answer is
gaining weight
Question: Why might someone decide to having a checkup for followup? Options: A: uncertainty,B: anxiety,C: stress,D: anxious,E: pain,. Knowledge: The word "checkup for followup" suggests that this is a medical appointment that is occurring after something else, likely a previous checkup or medical event. The word "uncertainty" suggests that there is still some question or concern that needs to be addressed, which is why the person is having a follow-up checkup. The other options do not necessarily indicate a reason for a checkup for follow-up, as they could apply to a range of different medical situations. Answer is
uncertainty
Question: What can a vehicle do to groceries? Options: A: eat,B: feel impact of accident,C: slow down,D: carry,E: travel,. Knowledge: The context of the question is related to groceries, which implies that the vehicle would be used to transport them. The word "carry" is the closest in meaning to transporting or moving something from one place to another, which would be the primary function of a vehicle in this context. The other options do not make sense in relation to groceries, as they either involve physical actions that cannot be performed by a vehicle (eating), or negative outcomes that would not be desirable (feeling the impact of an accident, slowing down). Answer is
carry
Question: A small dog lived with a a woman who loved him. Where might he have lived? Options: A: person's house,B: dog house,C: canada,D: illinois,E: basket,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog lived with a woman, which indicates that the dog was a pet and likely lived in the woman's house rather than a dog house. The option "basket" may seem like a possible answer, but it is unlikely that a dog would live permanently in a basket. Canada and Illinois are not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
person's house
Question: What area would you find a large number of wheat fields? Options: A: countryside,B: mill,C: bread,D: eat cake,E: farmer's field,. Knowledge: Wheat fields are commonly found in rural or agricultural areas, and the term "countryside" specifically refers to areas outside of cities and towns that are characterized by open fields and natural landscapes. "Mill" and "bread" are related to wheat, but do not necessarily indicate an area in which wheat fields are concentrated. "Eat cake" is unrelated and "farmer's field" is too general to infer a specific crop or location. Answer is
countryside
Question: Where are you likely to find well stocked aisles? Options: A: supermarket,B: church,C: car wash,D: sanctuary,E: building,. Knowledge: A well-stocked aisle is most commonly associated with a store or supermarket that sells goods. The other options, such as a church, car wash or sanctuary, do not have aisles that would typically be referred to as "well-stocked". A building is a general term that could refer to any type of structure and does not provide enough context to determine where well-stocked aisles might be found. Answer is
supermarket
Question: Where can butter be found in small pats? Options: A: refrigerator,B: restaurant,C: inside a mammoth's handbag,D: pastry,E: fridge,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that small pats of butter are commonly found in a specific location, suggesting that it is a common item in that context. While butter can certainly be found in refrigerators, pastry, and fridges, these options do not specify the size or form of the butter, making them less likely to be the correct answer. The inclusion of "inside a mammoth's handbag" is clearly a joke and can be eliminated as an option. The most appropriate answer is thus "restaurant," where small pats of butter are often provided with bread or other dishes. Answer is
restaurant
Question: Wanting to listen to the radio, what did the man do to it? Options: A: play music,B: turn on,C: train,D: blaring,E: radiotracking,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man wanted to listen to the radio, which suggests that it was initially turned off. Therefore, the correct answer is "turn on." The other options (play music, train, blaring, radiotracking) do not accurately describe what the man did to the radio to be able to listen to it. Answer is
turn on
Question: He is beginning work at his first job.  What is he feeling? Options: A: panic,B: resting,C: stress,D: excitement,E: working,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that this is the person's first job, which suggests that they may be experiencing feelings of excitement and anticipation. Starting a new job can be a significant and positive milestone in someone's life, so it's more likely that he is excited rather than feeling panic, stress, or simply resting. The option "working" is not a feeling, but rather an action that will come after starting the job. Answer is
excitement
Question: Why do children usually like jumping rope? Options: A: increased heart rate,B: smiling,C: sweating,D: having fun,E: jumping,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a reason why children enjoy jumping rope, which is unlikely to be related to physiological processes such as an increased heart rate or sweating. While those physical effects may be caused by jumping rope, they are not likely to be the primary motivator for why children enjoy the activity. "Smiling" is a possible answer, but it is not specific enough to explain why children enjoy jumping rope. Therefore, "having fun" is the best answer because it directly relates to the enjoyment that children experience from this activity. Answer is
having fun
Question: What do I look forward to when opening a business? Options: A: stress,B: success,C: failure,D: bankruptcy,E: cash,. Knowledge: The word "look forward to" suggests a positive outcome, and the context of opening a business implies that the goal is to be successful. Opening a business is often associated with hopes and aspirations for success, rather than stress, failure, or bankruptcy. "Cash" could be a factor in success, but it is not the ultimate goal. Answer is
success
Question: Where can someone get a flute? Options: A: orchestra,B: steal it,C: marching band,D: symphony,E: musical instrument store,. Knowledge: The other options, such as stealing a flute or finding one in a marching band, are not ethical or practical ways to obtain a flute. Orchestras and symphonies may have flutes, but they are typically reserved for members of the ensemble. A musical instrument store, on the other hand, is a place where one can buy or rent a variety of musical instruments, including flutes. Therefore, the correct answer is musical instrument store. Answer is
musical instrument store
Question: Why do people go about killing people ? Options: A: murder,B: get killed,C: sporting event,D: hate,E: feel remorse,. Knowledge: The word "killing" suggests intentional and unjustified taking of a human life, which is categorized as murder. The reason why people commit this crime varies from person to person, but one common motivation for murder is hate or anger towards the victim. The other options, such as sporting events or feeling remorse, do not align with the severity and intentionality of murder. Answer is
hate
Question: For what reason did he commit the killing? Options: A: investigation,B: disease,C: punishment,D: retribution,E: going to jail,. Knowledge: The word "retribution" refers to punishment inflicted on someone as vengeance for a wrong or criminal act. In this context, it suggests that the person committed the killing as a form of revenge or retaliation for something that was done to them, making it the most likely answer. "Investigation," "disease," and "going to jail" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, while "punishment" is a possibility but not as specific as "retribution." Answer is
retribution
Question: Bobby sat on the examination table.  Happy that this was a simple procedure, and he could do it here instead of staying overnight some place else.  Where might he be? Options: A: hospital,B: school,C: obituary,D: doctor's office,E: vets office,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions an examination table, which is typically found in a medical setting. The fact that Bobby is happy this is a simple procedure and that he doesn't have to stay overnight suggests that it's a routine medical check-up or appointment, rather than an emergency or serious illness. The hospital and vet's office options might be plausible, but the language of the sentence suggests a human patient rather than an animal. The school and obituary options have no connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
doctor's office
Question: Brian was a soldier.  he just got word that he was called back to active service.  He'd have to do what soon? Options: A: report for duty,B: wait for orders,C: fight for freedom,D: obay,E: receive orders,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Brian was a soldier and has received the news that he was called back to active service, meaning he would have to report for duty soon. The other options may be related to being a soldier, but they do not accurately reflect the immediate action that Brian would need to take upon being called back to active service. Answer is
report for duty
Question: Where would you put things in a paper bag? Options: A: synagogue,B: classroom,C: grocery store,D: lunchbox,E: front porch,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the question is related to shopping or carrying items in a bag. A grocery store is a common place to use a paper bag for carrying purchases, while a synagogue, classroom, lunchbox, and front porch are not typically associated with this activity. Answer is
grocery store
Question: Where would you put some coffee if you are thirsty? Options: A: container,B: internet cafe,C: starbucks,D: cup,E: supermarket,.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
cup
Question: I went to a party at my friend's house in New York and everyone there shared a meal in what eating place? Options: A: mall counter,B: big city,C: shopping area,D: restaurant,E: dining room,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker went to a party at a friend's house, which implies a more casual setting than a restaurant or mall counter. Additionally, sharing a meal typically takes place in a designated eating area, such as a dining room, rather than a shopping area or big city. Answer is
dining room
Question: James loved going down.  He thought that the worst part of climbing was what? Options: A: loss of oxygen,B: blisters,C: ascending,D: vertigo,E: getting a snack,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James enjoys going down, which implies that he doesn't enjoy going up. This eliminates options such as loss of oxygen, blisters, and vertigo, which are all physical ailments that can occur during climbing regardless of which direction one is going. Getting a snack is also unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be ascending, which is the direct opposite of going down. Answer is
ascending
Question: Where would explosive devices be used to build and demolish things? Options: A: bomb,B: army,C: war,D: workplace,E: construction site,. Knowledge: Explosive devices are commonly used in construction sites for building and demolishing structures. They are particularly useful in cases where traditional demolition methods may not be practical due to safety or space constraints. While bombs and explosives are also associated with the military and war, the context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on their use in a non-violent setting. The options "army" and "war" are therefore less likely to be correct. "Workplace" could be a possible answer, but it is more general and does not specifically relate to the use of explosive devices. Answer is
construction site
Question: A child needs caregivers.  Who are the most common caregivers for a child? Options: A: become adult,B: adult,C: swing set,D: parent,E: father,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that a child requires the presence of someone to take care of them, suggesting that the answer is a person or group of people. The most common caregivers for a child are typically their parents, as they are responsible for nurturing and supporting their child's growth and development. The other options are either not relevant to the context of the sentence or do not describe a caregiver role. Answer is
parent
Question: Where do you bring a small dog if it needs to relieve itself? Options: A: europe,B: front porch,C: heat,D: basket,E: outside,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a small dog needs to relieve itself, which would typically require going outside.

Question: Driving is the most popular form of personal what? Options: A: transportation,B: traffic jams,C: moving,D: status,E: traffic accident,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that driving is a common way for people to move from one place to another, which is a characteristic commonly associated with transportation. Traffic jams and accidents may be negative aspects of driving, but they do not describe the purpose or function of driving. Moving may involve a variety of methods, such as walking, using public transportation, or hiring a moving company, so it does not accurately reflect the popularity of driving as a personal mode of transportation. Status may be a reason why some people choose to drive, but it is not the most widely recognized aspect of personal transportation. Answer is
transportation
Question: The woman let her son play with it in his room.  She did not do what? Options: A: forbid,B: annoy,C: prohibit,D: stop,E: disallow,. Knowledge: The use of the word "let" indicates that the woman allowed her son to play with something in his room, so options like prohibit and disallow can be eliminated as they suggest the opposite action of not allowing something. Annoy is a possibility, but it doesn't fit as well with the context of the sentence. Stop is also a possibility, but it doesn't convey the sense of disallowing something that forbid does. Therefore, forbid is the best choice. Answer is
forbid
Question: Where is likely the coziest plat to eat? Options: A: downtown,B: prison,C: city,D: own house,E: earing,. Knowledge: The word "cozy" suggests a comfortable, warm, and intimate environment, which is typically associated with one's own house. Eating in one's own house can provide a sense of familiarity and relaxation that may not be found in a public space like downtown, prison, or city. The inclusion of "earing" is likely a typo and does not make sense in the sentence. Answer is
own house
Question: Where is a bunch of grapes likely to be carried in? Options: A: fruit cocktail,B: wine press,C: a box,D: picnic basket,E: kitchen,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is related to carrying a bunch of grapes. Picnic baskets are often associated with carrying food and drinks for outdoor activities, making it the most likely option. A wine press is used for making wine and a box is too general without any specific details about what the grapes are for. The fruit cocktail and kitchen options are also not related to carrying a bunch of grapes. Answer is
picnic basket
Question: The monger removed the bone, what was he looking to serve? Options: A: octopus,B: fresh fish,C: skeleton,D: human body,E: dog's mouth,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the monger removed a bone in preparation for serving something. Out of the given choices, only fresh fish is a common food that would require the removal of bones. Octopus is typically served whole or in large pieces, and would not require bone removal. Skeleton, human body, and dog's mouth are all inappropriate choices for food. Answer is
fresh fish
Question: James was cooling off in the pool on a hot summer day.  Why might have he been doing that? Options: A: sweating,B: relaxation,C: revenge,D: shivering,E: loss of heat,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was trying to cool off on a hot summer day, which is often done for the purpose of relaxation. Swimming or sitting in a pool can help to reduce body temperature and provide a break from the heat, which may explain why James was doing it. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
relaxation
Question: Where would you enjoy a beer while throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects? Options: A: bowling alley,B: hockey game,C: sporting event,D: croquet,E: fridge,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions "throwing heavy spheres toward ten white objects," which is a clear reference to the sport of bowling. Bowling alleys are specifically designed for this sport, and they often have bars or restaurants where patrons can enjoy a beer while playing. The other options, such as a hockey game or croquet, do not involve throwing heavy spheres or white objects, and the option of a fridge does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
bowling alley
Question: Where would you get a baseball if you do not have one? Options: A: sporting goods store,B: america,C: park,D: sandbox,E: break window,. Knowledge: A sporting goods store is a typical place to purchase a baseball.

sporting goods store

Options: A: tornado,B: weapon,C: baseball,D: air,E: canon,. Knowledge: The phrase "torn to shreds" refers to a destructive force that has the ability to break down a large object into many small pieces. Additionally, the phrase "one projectile after another flying through the air" suggests a swirling motion that is typical of a tornado. A tornado is a powerful and destructive weather phenomenon that can easily tear through buildings and cause debris to fly through the air. The other options, such as "weapon," "baseball," "air," and "cannon," do not fit the context and would not be able to explain the destructive force described in the sentence. Answer is
tornado
Question: The person was bored by the remedial math class, what did he want out of the class? Options: A: look beautiful,B: swimming lessons,C: intellectual stimulation,D: own house,E: time to rest,.

The option "intellectual stimulation" is directly related to the sentence, as it suggests that the person wanted to be intellectually engaged by the class. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
intellectual stimulation
Question: Sally needed a break from her hard work.  She took a vacation, and decided to do what to a sand castle? Options: A: faster,B: piece together,C: construct,D: put together,E: working,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sally took a break from hard work by going on vacation and doing an activity that involves building. Sand castles are typically constructed and built, which makes "construct" the most appropriate option. "Faster" and "working" do not make sense in the context of building a sand castle, while "piece together" and "put together" imply that the castle was already in some state of completion before Sally began her activity, which is not indicated in the sentence. Answer is
construct
Question: Mary never allowed her animal friend to do what without a leash? Options: A: leave home,B: vomit,C: eating,D: hunt for food,E: fight for life,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mary's animal friend needs to be on a leash when doing a certain activity.

The other options are not related to the concept of leash-walking. Answer is
leave home
Question: What is a good place for a grumpy cat? Options: A: sand box,B: back yard,C: ground,D: warm bed,E: shelf,.

The other options, such as a sandbox or a shelf, do not suggest a comfortable or cozy environment for a grumpy cat. Answer is
warm bed

Knowledge: Becoming inebriated often refers to becoming drunk, which can impair judgment, coordination, and impulse control. This can lead to aggressive, harmful, or reckless behavior, such as getting into fights. Addiction, arrest, and paralysis are less common outcomes of becoming inebriated. Staggering may occur as a physical symptom of intoxication, but it is not a consequence that someone would "get into." Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the space being described has room for multiple bedrooms, an office, a study, and a playroom.

Building is too vague, and nursery school and preschool are not consistent with the context provided. Answer is
big house
Question: What could have a hot handle? Options: A: carrying things,B: coffee cup,C: iron,D: frying pan,E: briefcase,. Knowledge: Frying pans are often used in cooking and can become very hot, which is why they typically have a handle to make them easier to hold and maneuver while cooking.

The other choices don't make sense in this context. Answer is
promotion
Question: Attempting to light a wet match is likely to result in what? Options: A: make fire,B: rain,C: combustion,D: illumination,E: frustration,. Knowledge: The phrase "wet match" suggests that the match is damp or moist, which means that it will not light easily. This is because the moisture can prevent the match from igniting, and can also put out the flame if the match does light. Therefore, attempting to light a wet match is more likely to result in frustration rather than any of the other options suggested. Answer is
frustration
Question: What is the worst thing that someone can do while driving? Options: A: getting somewhere,B: use gas,C: doze off,D: listening others,E: speeding ticket,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is one specific action that is considered the "worst thing" to do while driving. From a safety perspective, dozing off or falling asleep while driving is extremely dangerous and can result in serious accidents. The other options such as "getting somewhere" or "using gas" are not inherently dangerous while driving, while "listening to others" is not specific enough to the context and "speeding ticket" refers to a consequence of bad driving, rather than the action itself. Answer is
doze off
Question: Where is the best place to put shoes? Options: A: closet,B: table,C: box,D: bed,E: park,. Knowledge: The question is asking about the best place to store shoes, which suggests that the answer should be a location where shoes can be organized and kept out of the way when not in use. A closet is a common location for storing shoes as it allows for easy organization and access, while keeping them hidden away from the rest of the living space. The other options do not provide an adequate solution for shoe storage. Answer is
closet
Question: James's hammer bent while he was driving nails. He needed a new one.  Where might he go to find one? Options: A: repair shop,B: carpenter's toolbox,C: tool box,D: hardware store,E: tool shop,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James needs a new hammer, which is a common tool found in hardware stores. Hardware stores typically carry a wide range of tools, including hammers, and are a common place to buy tools for household or DIY projects. While a repair shop or tool shop could potentially have hammers, they are not as commonly associated with selling these types of tools. A carpenter's toolbox or personal tool box may not have a new hammer readily available, as these are typically stored with the owner's personal tools. Answer is
hardware store
Question: What happens when you get a blackout from amnesia? Options: A: amnesia,B: drunkenness,C: hangover,D: enjoy,E: burn,. Knowledge: The question is asking about the result of getting a blackout from amnesia, which suggests a loss of memory.

Answer is
amnesia
Question: A woodworker is missing a screw, where should he look for it? Options: A: tool box,B: wall outlet fixture,C: on the ground,D: motorcycle,E: computer,. Knowledge: A screw is a small, metal fastener commonly used in woodworking.

The tool box is a common storage location for screws, while the other options have no connection to woodworking or screws. Answer is
tool box
Question: Her dream was to own a house on the countryside, but instead she lived in a cramped apartment in the what? Options: A: street,B: ghetto,C: residential area,D: subdivision,E: city,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman did not fulfill her dream of owning a house in the countryside and instead settled for a cramped apartment. The word "city" provides a clear contrast to the dream of living in the countryside, while the other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well. "Street" and "residential area" could refer to a variety of locations, while "ghetto" and "subdivision" have negative and positive connotations respectively, which are not implied in the sentence. Answer is
city
Question: In a predicament an animal might choose flight or what? Options: A: leave home,B: hunt for food,C: smell prey,D: feel pain,E: fight for life,. Knowledge: The word "predicament" suggests a difficult or challenging situation, in which an animal might need to protect itself. The option "fight for life" is the most appropriate response, as it implies that the animal is facing a life-threatening situation and might need to use aggression to protect itself. The other options do not necessarily relate to survival in a dangerous circumstance. Answer is
fight for life
Question: What container does peanut butter come in? Options: A: cupboard,B: pantry,C: jar,D: bottle,E: supermarket,. Knowledge: Peanut butter is commonly sold in jars, which are typically made of glass or plastic and have a screw-on lid for easy opening and closing. The other options, such as cupboard and pantry, are places where you might store peanut butter once it's been opened and transferred to a different container. A bottle would be an unusual choice for peanut butter packaging, and supermarkets are places where you can buy peanut butter, but they are not the specific container that it comes in. Answer is
jar
Question: The war was followed by a tentative peace.  People didn't think it would last because despite a desire to move forward, there rebuilding was difficult and there was a lot of what? Options: A: love and understanding,B: fighting,C: hostility,D: destruction,E: turmoil,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite a desire for peace, there were difficulties in rebuilding and a sense of instability or upheaval. Turmoil means a state of great disturbance, confusion or uncertainty, and is a suitable word to describe the situation described in the sentence. The other options do not accurately reflect the sense of unrest and uncertainty conveyed by the context of the sentence. Answer is
turmoil
Question: What could cats do if they were taller? Options: A: annoy,B: eat meat,C: open doors,D: need food,E: jog,. Knowledge: The question asks about what cats could do if they were taller. Cats, being intelligent creatures, might be able to do certain things if they were tall enough to reach or grasp objects that they cannot currently reach, such as opening doors. The other choices - annoy, eat meat, need food, and jog - either do not have any clear connection to the context of the question or have no direct relation to a cat's ability to be taller. Answer is
open doors
Question: The snake was worried about predators overhead, where did it go for cover? Options: A: wooded area,B: tropical forest,C: warm place,D: canyon,E: sleeping bag,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the snake was seeking cover from predators that may be above ground, which suggests that it was seeking shelter under some sort of overhead cover. A wooded area would provide ample opportunity for the snake to seek shelter under branches and leaves. The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence, as a tropical forest or warm place may not provide enough overhead cover and a canyon or sleeping bag do not seem like feasible options for a snake seeking cover. Answer is
wooded area
Question: Where can you take home a hermit crab? Options: A: pet shop,B: fishmongers,C: intertidal zone,D: tidepools,E: ocean,. Knowledge: Hermit crabs are commonly sold as pets in pet shops, making this the most likely answer. Fishmongers sell fish, not hermit crabs, and the intertidal zone and tidepools are natural habitats where hermit crabs might be found but not taken home. The ocean is too vast to pinpoint a specific location to take home a hermit crab. Answer is
pet shop
Question: Why is someone getting drunk likely to sleep with someone they usually wouldn't approve of? Options: A: tired,B: violence,C: falling down,D: lower standards,E: vomiting,. Knowledge: Alcohol consumption can impair judgment and decision-making abilities, leading individuals to make choices they may not make if they were sober. This can include choosing to engage in sexual activity with someone they may not typically find attractive or approve of. The other options do not provide a clear explanation for this behavior, and may not be related to alcohol consumption. Answer is
lower standards
Question: Where should meat to be used soon be? Options: A: freezer,B: fridge,C: butcher shop,D: counter,E: frying pan,. Knowledge: The question suggests that the meat is not going to be used immediately and needs to be stored properly to prevent spoilage. Freezing is an option for long-term storage, but the question specifies that it needs to be used soon, so the freezer is not the best answer. Butcher shop and frying pan are not options for storing meat. The counter is not a good choice either, as it can lead to bacterial growth if the meat is left at room temperature for too long. The fridge is the most appropriate answer for storing meat that needs to be used soon, as it will slow down bacterial growth and keep the meat fresh for a few more days. Answer is
fridge
Question: Where does someone get a rubber for sex? Options: A: drug store,B: wallet,C: bedside table,D: house,E: classroom,. Knowledge: The word "rubber" in this context refers to a condom, which is a form of contraception used during sexual activity. Condoms are typically sold in drug stores, as well as other places like supermarkets, convenience stores, and health clinics. The other options do not make sense in the context of the question. Answer is
drug store
Question: James tripped while running in the house.   His mother had repeatedly warned him to put his toys away but he did not listen. Where might his toys have been? Options: A: slippery,B: floor,C: store,D: drawer,E: basement,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James tripped over something in the house, which implies that the toys were on the floor where he was running. Additionally, his mother had warned him to put his toys away, indicating that they were likely scattered on the floor rather than neatly stored in a drawer or a basement. The options "slippery" and "store" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
floor
Question: Large fluffy clouds do what to people who watch them? Options: A: blanket,B: cause rain to fall,C: awe inspiring,D: rain water,E: bring rain,. Knowledge: The phrase "large fluffy clouds" suggests that the clouds have a visually pleasing and impressive appearance which can often evoke feelings of wonder or amazement in people who observe them. The option "blanket" does not make sense in the context of the sentence, "cause rain to fall" and "bring rain" suggests that the clouds are responsible for precipitation which is not mentioned in the sentence, and "rain water" is not a suggested effect of observing the clouds. Answer is
awe inspiring
Question: She had to run errands that day, she did it right away because she prefers to what? Options: A: complete tasks,B: gain,C: make tea,D: helpful,E: get things done,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the woman completed her errands right away, suggesting that she has a preference for efficiency and productivity. The phrase "get things done" directly relates to this idea of being productive and completing tasks. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
get things done
Question: The person forgot to put a lid on the garbage, raccoons knocked all of it out of the what? Options: A: container,B: composted,C: nice aroma,D: smell terrible,E: smells bad,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person forgot to put a lid on a container, likely a garbage can, and that raccoons were able to knock all of the garbage out. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence. "Composted" implies that the garbage was being turned into compost, which is not mentioned. "Nice aroma" suggests the garbage smelled good, which is not the case in the sentence. "Smell terrible" and "smells bad" describe the smell of the garbage, but do not indicate what the raccoons knocked it out of. Answer is
container
Question: Sometimes when animals meet, what happens? Options: A: fight each other,B: procreate,C: sleep,D: live lives,E: listen to each other,. Knowledge: The word "meet" suggests that the animals are encountering each other for the first time, and given the range of options, it is likely that there will be some sort of interaction or reaction. "Procreate" would only occur if the animals were of the opposite sex and willing to mate. "Sleep" and "live lives" are too general and could happen regardless of whether animals meet or not. "Listen to each other" might occur in some cases, but it is less likely than animals fighting each other to establish dominance. Answer is
fight each other
Question: A judge was on his bench serving justice, what was his most important principle? Options: A: honest,B: lawyre,C: fair,D: arranging files,E: tell truth,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the judge was doing his job on his bench, and the most important principle related to his job would be the idea of being fair. Being fair is a foundational principle of serving justice, thus marking it as the most important principle. The other options - honest, lawyer, arranging files, and telling the truth - do not relate directly to the idea of serving justice, and hence do not qualify as the answer. Answer is
fair
Question: Where can you find a story in print? Options: A: bookstore,B: school,C: newspaper,D: past,E: book or magazine,. Knowledge: A story in print can refer to a work of fiction or non-fiction that is published in a physical format such as a book or a magazine. Bookstores are a common place to find books, while schools may have textbooks or novels for students to read. Newspapers typically contain news articles and not fiction or longer-form stories. The option "past" does not make sense in this context as it is not a physical location or item where stories can be found. Answer is
book or magazine
Question: Why would someone want to be eating? Options: A: satisfaction,B: dyspepsia,C: indigestion,D: to gloat,E: gaining weight,. Knowledge: Eating is usually done to satisfy hunger and provide the body with necessary nutrients to maintain health. The other options, such as dyspepsia and indigestion, are negative outcomes from overeating or eating unhealthy foods. To gloat does not relate to the act of eating, and gaining weight may be a consequence of frequent overeating but is not a reason someone would want to eat. Answer is
satisfaction
Question: Where would you go to learn how to play a french horn? Options: A: music store,B: concert hall,C: music class,D: france,E: on top of a mountain,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the learner is looking for a formal setting to learn how to play a french horn. While one could potentially find resources and guidance in other settings, such as a music store or concert hall, a music class is a dedicated space for learning and instruction. France may be associated with the instrument due to its name, but it is not a relevant answer for where to learn how to play it. On top of a mountain is clearly an absurd choice and can be eliminated. Answer is
music class
Question: Joe crossed the half court boundary and focused on 3 pointers.  What game is his playing? Options: A: society,B: sporting event,C: football,D: atlas or map,E: basketball,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions the half court boundary and 3 pointers, which are specific to the game of basketball. The other options have no relation to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Question: Other than water, sugar is the main ingredient in what? Options: A: candy bar,B: soda pop,C: coffee,D: tea,E: cupboard,. Knowledge: The sentence states that sugar is a main ingredient, which implies that it is being used as a sweetener in a food or beverage. Candy bars and tea often contain sugar, but water is not a typical ingredient in either. Coffee may be sweetened with sugar, but it is not a main ingredient. Cupboard is not a food or beverage, so it can be eliminated as an option. Therefore, soda pop, which is known to contain high amounts of sugar, is the most likely answer. Answer is
soda pop
Question: It was a nice day out, good weather to fire up the grill out in the what? Options: A: restaurant,B: kitchen,C: park,D: back yard,E: backyard,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is talking about a place where they can fire up a grill, which is typically done outdoors. The options "restaurant" and "kitchen" do not make sense in this context, as those are indoor spaces where grilling would not typically occur. "Park" could be a possible option, but the use of the word "out" suggests that the speaker is already outside, so they would not need to go to a park to grill. Therefore, the best answer would be "backyard," which is a common outdoor space for grilling. Answer is
backyard
Question: Steve needed a place to sleep so he asked around and found a place to stay.  Where might he be staying? Options: A: apartment,B: friend's house,C: tent,D: outside,E: living room,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Steve asked people for a place to stay, which implies that he is likely staying with someone he knows. The options "apartment" and "tent" do not fit the context of the sentence because they imply that Steve found a place to stay on his own. The option "outside" is unlikely because it suggests Steve would be sleeping outdoors, which is not a common or safe option. The option "living room" is a possibility, but the most likely answer is "friend's house" since it is common for people to offer a spare room or couch to a friend in need. Answer is
friend's house
Question: The man reduced the town to rubble out of hate, what was his goal? Options: A: wage war,B: play nice,C: fight enemy,D: stab to death,E: destroy enemy,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man's goal was to completely destroy the town, which is often a tactic used in war to weaken the enemy. In this context, "reducing to rubble" means destroying completely. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence and do not align with the man's actions of hate and destruction. Answer is
destroy enemy
Question: What does a child learn to do in a lake? Options: A: become adult,B: row boat,C: drive,D: go out to play,E: begin school,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a child is learning a specific skill related to a lake. The option "row boat" is the most specific skill related to being on a lake, as it involves using oars to move a small boat through the water. The other options, such as becoming an adult, starting school, or driving, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Go out to play" is a more general option that could fit, but it is not as specific as "row boat." Answer is
row boat
Question: Where do you keep a chess board? Options: A: house,B: basement,C: toy store,D: cabinet,E: retirement community,. Knowledge: Chess boards are typically kept in a cabinet when not in use to protect the pieces and keep them organized. Keeping a chess board in a house is too general and does not specify where in the house it would be kept. Likewise, keeping it in a basement or retirement community is not specific enough or applicable to all situations. Keeping it in a toy store does not make sense as it is not a place where one would typically keep personal items. Answer is
cabinet
Question: They were going to play at the theater, part way through there was a what? Options: A: spending money,B: intermission,C: being entertained,D: sleepiness,E: man of la mancha,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the event being described involves a performance at a theater, likely a play or musical. The phrase "part way through" suggests that the performance was interrupted temporarily. An intermission is a common pause in live performances that allows the audience to take a break, use the restroom, and purchase refreshments. "Spending money" and "being entertained" are too vague and do not relate directly to the context of the sentence. "Sleepiness" is unrelated and "man of la mancha" is a specific reference that does not fit the sentence. Answer is
intermission
Question: Where would you carry a small folding knife? Options: A: kitchen drawer,B: fishing boat,C: pocket,D: garbage bag,E: table,. Knowledge: A small folding knife is often carried in a pocket for convenience and easy access. The other options do not make sense in the context of carrying a knife, as they are not locations where a knife would typically be stored or used. A kitchen drawer might contain a larger knife used for cooking, a fishing boat might have specialized knives for cleaning fish, and a garbage bag and table are not relevant to the question. Answer is
pocket
Question: Where would you go if you want to get a newspaper with a specific title? Options: A: library,B: magazine article,C: archives,D: safe deposit box,E: page,. Knowledge: A library is a common place to find newspapers, especially if you are looking for a specific title. Many libraries keep archives of newspapers on microfilm or in digital format, and they may also have physical copies available for borrowing or viewing within the library. Magazine articles and archives may contain information about the newspaper, but they are not a direct source for obtaining a specific title. Safe deposit boxes are typically used for storing valuable items such as jewelry or important documents, and a page is a part of a book or document, not a location for obtaining a newspaper. Answer is
library
Question: If you want to find a star you'd have to look in space, but if you wanted to find one from the screen you should travel to where? Options: A: outer space,B: uganda,C: constellation,D: solar system,E: hollywood,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is not about finding an actual star in the sky, but rather a celebrity that is famous and well-known. Since the other options do not have any relevance to the world of entertainment or celebrities, the answer must be "hollywood" which is a famous location known for being the center of the movie industry and the place where many celebrities live and work. Answer is
hollywood
Question: What is it called when animals produce offspring? Options: A: birth,B: reproduce asexually,C: lie down,D: procreate,E: feel pain,. Knowledge: Procreation refers specifically to the act of animals (and humans) reproducing and producing offspring. The other options do not accurately describe the process of reproduction or are unrelated to the question. "Birth" involves the delivery of offspring, rather than the act of producing them. "Reproduce asexually" refers to a type of reproduction that does not involve the combination of genetic material from two parents. "Lie down" and "feel pain" do not have any connection to reproduction. Answer is
procreate
Question: I was depressed and my friends threw me a party, why did they do that? Options: A: reciprocity,B: make happy,C: make money,D: get drunk,E: embarrassing yourself,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker was feeling down and their friends threw them a party to help cheer them up. The phrase "make happy" directly relates to this situation, as it implies that the friends were trying to improve the speaker's mood. Reciprocity, getting drunk, and embarrassing oneself do not fit the context of the sentence. Making money is also unlikely as a motive for this kind of gesture. Answer is
make happy
Question: Sam wasn't in a rush to shop.  That allowed him to be more mindful and do what? Options: A: slow down,B: leisure,C: take time,D: delay,E: go slowly,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sam was not in a hurry while shopping, which allowed him to be more mindful.

The other options either do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence or are too similar to the correct answer. Answer is
take time
Question: Where could you find a stray small dog? Options: A: animal shelter,B: big house,C: own home,D: georgia,E: on a leash,. Knowledge: A stray dog is one that has been lost or abandoned and is wandering without a home or owner. Therefore, the most likely place to find a stray dog would be an animal shelter, as they often take in and care for lost or abandoned animals until they can be reunited with their owners or adopted by new families. The other options do not necessarily have a connection to finding a stray dog, as a big house or own home may imply the dog already has an owner, while on a leash implies that the dog already has an owner who is taking them for a walk. Answer is
animal shelter
Question: The small dog spent a lot of time with the elderly, where did he volunteer? Options: A: own house,B: nursing home,C: park,D: own home,E: suburb,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the small dog volunteered somewhere, and given the context of spending time with the elderly, a nursing home is the most likely option. Nursing homes are often associated with elderly care and volunteering opportunities, especially for therapy dogs. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
nursing home
Question: Bill was a weasel, but he's a weasel you wanted on your side.  He held what? Options: A: public office,B: out of doors,C: candles,D: chicken coop,E: barn,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite being a weasel, Bill was someone you would want on your side. This implies that he had a particular skill or ability that made him valuable. Additionally, the phrase "public office" suggests a position of power or influence, which could be useful when trying to gain an advantage. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
public office

Options: A: dry mouth,B: changing behavior,C: hurt feelings,D: communicating with others,E: anger,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that talking to others can improve our emotional state, but if those individuals are mean or hurtful, they can have the opposite effect and cause negative emotions such as hurt feelings. The other options, dry mouth, changing behavior, communicating with others, and anger, do not fit with the context of the sentence and are not mentioned as potential outcomes of talking to mean people. Answer is
hurt feelings
Question: Everyone is ordinary but we are often told we are what? Options: A: unbelievable,B: strange,C: special,D: ugly,E: exceptional,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite everyone being ordinary, they are often told that they possess a quality that sets them apart from others. The word "special" fits this context, as it connotes a unique quality that makes someone stand out from the crowd. The other options, such as "ugly" and "strange," do not fit the positive tone of the sentence and are not supported by the context. "Unbelievable" and "exceptional" may be fitting options, but "special" is the most appropriate given the context of the sentence. Answer is
special
Question: what can one add to a building to increase it's size? Options: A: city,B: town,C: rooms,D: fall down,E: urban area,. Knowledge: The question implies that something can be added to a building to increase its size. Out of the options given, only "rooms" makes sense as something that can be added to a building.

rooms
Question: Where might someone drive through rows of apple tree? Options: A: countryside,B: mountains,C: front yard,D: wisconsin,E: washington state,. Knowledge: Rows of apple trees are commonly found in orchards, which are often located in rural areas such as the countryside. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of driving through rows of apple trees. The mountains may have trees, but apple orchards are not commonly found at high altitude. Front yards may have apple trees, but they would not be arranged in rows like in an orchard. Wisconsin and Washington State are known for apple production, but simply being in those states does not necessarily indicate that someone would be driving through rows of apple trees. Answer is
countryside
Question: Most animals get tired, and when they do they what? Options: A: bite,B: groom,C: procreate,D: keep alive,E: lie down,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when animals get tired, they do something to rest or take a break. Biting or grooming does not necessarily help them rest, while procreation and keeping alive are not related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer must be "lie down," which is a common way animals rest when they are tired. Answer is
lie down
Question: Where would you buy candy and other foods? Options: A: movies,B: supermarket,C: mall,D: jar,E: television,. Knowledge: The other options do not typically sell food items, whereas a supermarket is a common place to purchase groceries and snacks like candy. Movies may have a concession stand that sells candy, but it wouldn't typically offer a wide variety of foods. Malls may have food courts and snack stands, but they are not primarily focused on selling grocery items. Jar and television are also not places where people would typically purchase food items. Answer is
supermarket
Question: The claustrophobic person was getting in line, what did they feel? Options: A: anxiety,B: wait turn,C: late,D: terrible,E: nauseous,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the claustrophobic person was feeling a certain emotion while getting in line. Claustrophobia is a fear of confined spaces, which can cause anxiety and panic in those who suffer from it. The other options, such as "wait turn" and "late," do not have a direct connection to the claustrophobia described in the sentence. "Nauseous" may be a physical reaction to anxiety, but it is not specific to claustrophobia. "Terrible" is too vague to be a likely answer. Answer is
anxiety

Options: A: found in stall,B: farmhouse,C: doing farm work,D: ridden,E: found on ranch,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the horse had given many rides that day and was likely tired, so it is reasonable to assume that he would have been resting in his stall. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. The option "ridden" is incorrect because it doesn't provide an answer to where the horse was found. Answer is
found in stall
Question: What was the practical husband concerned most about when house shopping? Options: A: arriving,B: location,C: excitement,D: movement,E: expense,. Knowledge: The word "practical" suggests that the husband is focused on functionality and cost-effectiveness rather than novelty or adventure.

The other choices (arriving, location, excitement, movement) do not seem to have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Question: Where might I find a decanter outside of drinking alcohol? Options: A: georgia,B: kitchen cupboard,C: brewery,D: chemistry lab,E: restaurant,. Knowledge: The word "decanter" is often associated with pouring liquids, and in a chemistry lab, it may be used to transfer chemicals from one container to another. Decanters are also commonly used to aerate wine before drinking, but this answer choice is outside of the scope of the question, as it specifies "outside of drinking alcohol." The kitchen cupboard and restaurant answer choices do not have any clear connection to decanters, while the brewery answer choice specifies alcohol, which is excluded in the question. Answer is
chemistry lab
Question: I feel hunger, but I don't want to get any food because work has been slow this month, what don't I want to do? Options: A: drink,B: begin work,C: have lunch,D: eat quickly,E: spend money,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person is hesitant to get food because work has been slow, which suggests that they may be short on money. This would make spending money on lunch an undesirable option. The other choices do not directly relate to the context of the sentence - drinking, beginning work, or eating quickly may not necessarily require spending money, and having lunch is not necessarily an action that one would avoid due to financial concerns.

Options: A: bathroom,B: trash,C: drug store,D: beauty salon,E: box,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hair dryer was still in its original packaging, which would most likely be a box.

The bathroom could be a possible location for using a hair dryer, but it does not explain why the hair would have already dried before she took the dryer out. The trash and drug store are not relevant to the sentence at all, and the beauty salon is not a likely location for someone using a brand new hair dryer at home. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the ficus plant is not inside the house but is still protected from bugs, which rules out placing it near windows or in shady places where insects are more likely to be.

Answer is
screened porch

The other options, such as "uphill", "asia", and "encyclopedia", have no clear connection to the behavior of gazelles. "Steppe" may be a plausible choice, but it is less specific than "open field" and may not necessarily evoke the same mental image of a vast and unobstructed landscape. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the old clothes were not useful even as rags, implying that they were in very poor condition and could not be salvaged.

Studies have shown that divorce can lead to symptoms of depression and anxiety, and often involves a period of adjustment and recovery. The other options are not necessarily negative effects of divorce, and some may even be considered positive, depending on the individual's perspective. For example, "freedom" and "no spouse" may be seen as positive outcomes for someone who feels trapped or unhappy in their marriage.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the security detail was scanning something that could help them keep an eye on the entire crowd. The option "potato" is unrelated and does not make sense in context. "Body" and "person's head" are too specific and would not allow the security detail to keep track of everyone in the crowd. "Focus" is too vague and doesn't fit the context. Therefore, the most logical answer is "faces" because it is common for security personnel to continually scan the faces of people in a crowd to identify potential threats or individuals of interest. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Denny was searching for his hairbrush in his living space, which eliminates the options of car and drugstore. The fact that he closed the door behind him hints that he was searching in a room, which could be his bedroom or any other room in the house. However, since the sentence doesn't provide any cues about his morning routine or where he usually keeps his hairbrush, bedroom seems like the most logical option. Answer is
bedroom

This may occur when the learning material is particularly challenging or when the learner feels overwhelmed by the amount of information presented.

The other options do not fit the criteria of using a round toy. "Play with toys" is too vague and could refer to any type of toy, while "play sports" and "throw things" do not specifically mention using a round toy. "Frisbee" is a specific toy, but it is not always in the shape of a round disc and may not be suitable for younger children. Answer is
play ball
Question: Where can I go to see a really big toy balloon floating at the top of a dome? Options: A: parade,B: circus,C: amusement park,D: birthday party,E: magic show,.

The options "medicine cabinet," "grocery store," "dishwasher," and "liquor store" do not make sense in this context.

"Work" and "summer" are not locations and therefore do not fit the context of the question. "Louisiana" may be known for its BBQ but it does not provide a specific location. "Backyard" is the most logical answer as it is a common location for home BBQs. Answer is

Answer is
blossom

"South Pacific" is a region, and "movie scene" and "dictionary" are not related to the context of the question. Therefore, "sea water" is the most likely correct answer. Answer is

This suggests that the person has eaten a sufficient amount of food and is now "full." The other options do not provide a relevant reason for stopping to eat the hamburger.

This suggests that the new location is in a more populous and urban setting.

A greenhouse is a location where plants can be grown, but it is not necessarily a feature in someone's house. Answer is
windowsill

Sneezing is a common response to inhaling dust and other irritants, so it is the most likely choice. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not a common reaction to inhaling dust. Answer is
sneezing
Question: Mandy was watching television because she had a long day.  She could do much else because she was experiencing what? Options: A: joy,B: addiction,C: relaxation,D: fatigue,E: headaches,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mandy was watching television because she had a long day and couldn't do much else. This implies that she was likely feeling tired or fatigued, and therefore chose a low-energy activity such as watching TV. The other options are less likely, as joy would imply that she had a good day and was enjoying herself, addiction would imply a compulsive behavior that overrides feelings of fatigue, relaxation would imply a deliberate choice to unwind, and headaches would imply a physical discomfort that would likely prevent her from watching TV. Answer is
fatigue
Question: She let him know he was being over the top, and that his antics where a little what? Options: A: much,B: plenty,C: larger,D: lot of,E: big,. Knowledge: The phrase "over the top" is often used to describe behavior that is excessive or exaggerated. The word "much" is commonly used to convey a sense of excess or abundance, which is why it is the most appropriate option in this context. The other options do not convey the same sense of excessiveness as "much." Answer is
much
Question: Where can someone get well water? Options: A: oil field,B: field,C: countryside,D: kansas,E: ground,. Knowledge: Well water typically refers to water that is obtained from underground aquifers or wells that tap into them, making "ground" the most likely correct answer. While it is possible that someone could obtain water from a field or the countryside, it would likely require additional equipment or treatment to make it safe for drinking. An oil field, on the other hand, is not a likely source of well water as it typically involves the extraction of oil and gas, not water. Finally, Kansas is a specific location and does not necessarily have any relevance to the answer. Answer is
ground
Question: what is a characteristic of one who want to give assistance? Options: A: help one,B: helpful,C: listen,D: prepared,E: humanity,. Knowledge: The question is asking for a characteristic of someone who wants to give assistance, which implies a desire to be useful or supportive of others. The word "helpful" directly relates to this concept and is the most appropriate choice among the given options. "Listen" and "prepared" are good qualities for assisting others but do not specifically indicate a desire to provide help. "Humanity" is a vague characteristic that may or may not relate to assistance, depending on the context. Answer is
helpful
Question: The arch was just one of many sites to see, but most preferred the stained glass at the what? Options: A: doorway,B: cathedral,C: ancient rome,D: building,E: chapel,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that there are multiple sights to see, but most people prefer the stained glass at a specific location. The options "doorway", "ancient Rome", "building", and "chapel" do not accurately describe a specific location that would feature stained glass. However, "cathedral" is a common type of religious building that often contains intricate stained glass windows, making it a likely answer. Answer is
cathedral
Question: If I wanted to look at a drum, where would I go? Options: A: symphony orchestra,B: child's room,C: music store,D: rock band,E: parade,. Knowledge: Drums are a musical instrument that can be found in a variety of contexts, but the most likely place to find one to look at would be a music store. A symphony orchestra may have drums, but they would be part of a larger ensemble and likely not on display for viewing. A child's room may have a toy drum, but it is unlikely that this is what the question is referring to. A rock band may also have drums, but again, they would not be on display for viewing. A parade may feature drummers, but this is not a place where one could easily go to see a drum up close. Answer is
music store
Question: The text made no sense, it was just a random what? Options: A: sequence of words,B: book,C: hatred,D: fade,E: analyzing,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the text had no coherent meaning, indicating that it was just a sequence of words without any logical structure. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not convey the same lack of meaning or coherence. A book, for example, might be difficult to understand but would still have some structure or purpose, while hatred and fade do not relate to language or writing in the same way that analyzing or a sequence of words might. Answer is
sequence of words
Question: The man was still up at 2:30 am, so he was using the television, what was he hoping he would accomplish? Options: A: eye strain,B: falling asleep,C: laziness,D: boredom,E: get smarter,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was up late and using the television as a tool to help him accomplish something. The options "eye strain," "laziness," and "get smarter" do not fit the context of the sentence. "Boredom" is a possibility, but the context suggests that the man had a specific goal in mind. "Falling asleep," on the other hand, is a common reason for people to use the television late at night, as it can help to create a relaxed and drowsy environment. Answer is
falling asleep
Question: What is water to someone? Options: A: dangerous,B: blue,C: toxic,D: important,E: surface of earth,. Knowledge: The question is asking for a general description of water to someone, which suggests that the answer should be a broad and fundamental attribute of water. "Important" is the most suitable option because water is essential for all living organisms to survive and is critical for many human activities such as agriculture, industry, and transportation. The other options are either too specific or negative in their association with water. Answer is
important
Question: Where did the farmer send the heifer to make money when she was no longer useful to the farm? Options: A: sanctuary farm,B: cow pasture,C: countryside,D: cattle ranch,E: slaughterhouse,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the heifer was no longer useful to the farm, which may mean that it was either too old or unable to produce milk. In such cases, farmers usually sell the animal to make some money. Since "sanctuary farm" and "cow pasture" are not places that buy animals, they can be eliminated. "Countryside" is a generic term and does not specifically relate to the sale of animals. "Cattle ranch" may buy animals, but it is not a common practice to sell unproductive cows to ranches. Therefore, the correct answer is "slaughterhouse," which is where animals are killed and processed for food. Answer is
slaughterhouse
Question: The art project called for a big wooden rod, so she went where to get one? Options: A: hardware store,B: tree stump,C: old clock,D: old houses,E: broom closet,. Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the art project required a big wooden rod, which suggests that the item is not readily available in the immediate surroundings such as a tree stump or broom closet. The options "old clock" and "old houses" are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. A hardware store is a likely place to find a variety of wooden rods in different sizes and shapes. Answer is
hardware store
Question: If you dont fail at life you are? Options: A: completing,B: succeeding,C: passed,D: passing,E: good at it,. Knowledge: The sentence presents failure as the opposite of the answer, suggesting that the correct choice is a state of achievement or success. The options "completed" and "passed" suggest a one-time event, while "good at it" lacks specificity and could apply to any skill or activity. "Succeeding" and "passing" are both commonly used to describe ongoing progress and achievement, but "passing" implies a minimum standard of performance, while "succeeding" suggests a higher level of success. Answer is
succeeding
Question: Worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain, why are they? Options: A: wet soil,B: start to fall,C: dry soil,D: wet things,E: wet ground,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the worms are crawling out of the earth in the middle of rain, which suggests that moisture is playing a role here. It is a common phenomenon for worms to come out of soil when it is wet because they need moisture to breathe. If the soil becomes too compact or dry, they cannot move or breathe properly, and hence might die. Thus, it is more likely that the worms are coming out due to the presence of wet soil rather than dry soil or other wet things. The option "start to fall" seems to be unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
wet soil
Question: Where are people likely to enjoy a show? Options: A: theater,B: wedding,C: in the garden,D: opera,E: convention,. Knowledge: The options include a few different types of events, but only one of them is specifically associated with shows: the theater. A theater is a venue designed for live performances, such as plays, musicals, and comedy shows. While some of the other options may involve entertainment or performances, they do not have the same strong connection to the idea of enjoying a show as the theater does. Answer is
theater
Question: Where might you have to pay for a shopping bag now? Options: A: restaurant,B: closet,C: at starbucks,D: supermarket,E: home,. Knowledge: Many supermarkets have started charging for plastic bags to reduce waste and promote reusable bags. This practice is becoming increasingly common around the world. Other options like a restaurant or Starbucks may also charge for a bag, but it's not as common. The options of closet and home are not relevant to the context of the question. Answer is
supermarket

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject was known for being soft and sensitive, but in a situation where everyone's wills were tested, she stood out for being different. Being stoic means showing little emotion and not easily giving in to pressure, which fits the context of the sentence. The other options all suggest the opposite of being soft and sensitive. Answer is
stoic
Question: There are many dance clubs and higher rates of obesity where? Options: A: united states,B: ohio,C: toun,D: michigan,E: fast food restaurants,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a correlation between the presence of dance clubs and higher rates of obesity. Since the options are locations, we need to choose the one that is most likely to have both dance clubs and high rates of obesity. The United States is a large country with a diverse population that enjoys dancing and has high rates of obesity, making it the most likely answer. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are too specific to be considered a general trend. Answer is
united states
Question: A violin and three other instruments play in what? Options: A: orchestra,B: rock band,C: school,D: string quartet,E: music room,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions a specific combination of instruments - a violin and three others - which is commonly associated with a string quartet. String quartets are often associated with classical music and are comprised of two violins, a viola, and a cello. The other options do not include this specific combination of instruments, and do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
string quartet
Question: If your opponents in a marathon is very fast it is easy to fall what? Options: A: lightly,B: behind,C: train,D: slowly,E: sitfast,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if your opponents in a marathon are very fast, you may have difficulty keeping up with them and may fall behind. The word "behind" specifically means to not be in front of or to not keep up with others. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Lightly" does not make sense in this context, "train" is not a verb that describes falling behind, "slowly" suggests moving at a leisurely pace, and "sitfast" is not a commonly used term. Answer is
behind
Question: Where do you have to fan yourself in public watching people run and throw balls? Options: A: sports stadium,B: sauna,C: living room,D: appliance store,E: hot room,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a public place where people run and throw balls and it is hot enough to require fanning oneself. A sports stadium is a logical choice because it is a place where sporting events occur where people run and throw balls, and it could get very hot with all of the physical activity and body heat. Saunas and hot rooms are also hot, but they are not typically places where people run and throw balls in public. Living rooms and appliance stores would not normally have this type of activity taking place. Answer is
sports stadium
Question: I need to buy frozen food locally in the smaller shop, where would I go? Options: A: grocery store,B: supermarket,C: refrigerator,D: freezer,E: fridge,. Knowledge: The sentence states that the person is looking to buy frozen food in a smaller shop, indicating that they are not looking for a large supermarket or chain store. The most likely place to find a smaller shop that sells frozen food is a local grocery store. The options of refrigerator, freezer, and fridge are not relevant as they are appliances used for storing food, not purchasing it. Answer is
grocery store
Question: What is it called if a person has poor luck? Options: A: schizophrenia,B: misfortune,C: fearful,D: skills,E: criticism,. Knowledge: The question asks for a word or phrase that describes a person who has bad luck.

"Schizophrenia" is a mental health condition, "fearful" describes a person who is afraid or anxious, "skills" pertains to abilities or competencies, and "criticism" refers to negative feedback or disapproval. Answer is
misfortune
Question: Sometimes people are wronged, and sometimes getting revenge brings them what? Options: A: being happy,B: satisfaction,C: ownership,D: joy,E: disappointment,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting revenge can bring people a certain feeling. "Satisfaction" is the most likely choice as it implies a sense of accomplishment or righting a wrong. "Being happy," "joy," and "ownership" are not commonly associated with revenge and therefore do not fit in the context of the sentence. "Disappointment" is the opposite of what the sentence is suggesting. Answer is
satisfaction
Question: Dan is always giving assistance.  He what does he want to create for people? Options: A: better circumstances,B: happiness,C: people helped,D: learning new skills,E: death,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Dan is providing assistance with the intention of creating something positive for people. "Better circumstances" is the most general and broad option that could encompass a wide range of situations where someone might need assistance, such as financial, emotional, or physical. Happiness and learning new skills are more specific outcomes, while "people helped" is too vague and does not provide a clear goal for Dan's actions. Death is not a plausible option as it does not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
better circumstances
Question: What do marine life use to shelter themselves from a shark? Options: A: coral reef,B: television program,C: pacific ocean,D: open ocean,E: seaweed,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that marine life needs to shelter themselves from a shark, which indicates that the shark is a predator. Coral reefs are known to provide shelter and protection for various types of marine life, including small fish and crustaceans, which may explain why they are a viable option for sheltering oneself from a shark. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
coral reef

Knowledge: The phrase "board a vehicle on railing" may refer to boarding a train or other rail-based transportation, which would be done at a railway station. The other options, such as deck or porch, are not typically associated with rail transportation. A flight of stairs may be found at a railway station, but it alone does not indicate rail transportation. A bus station would be used for accessing buses, not rail-based transportation. Answer is
railway station
Question: Where are doctors known for going in their off time? Options: A: nursing home,B: emergency room,C: medical office,D: school,E: golf course,.

While doctors may frequent places such as medical offices or schools for work-related reasons, the other locations listed (nursing home, emergency room) are not typically associated with leisure activities. The option "golf course" is a common stereotype of doctors enjoying golfing during their off time. Therefore, it is the most likely answer. Answer is
golf course
Question: Where can you find a revolving door at a location you spend the night? Options: A: new york,B: apartment,C: hotel lobby,D: public place,E: bank,.

It is less common in other locations such as banks or public places, which typically have standard doors or automatic sliding doors. While some apartment buildings may have revolving doors, it is not as common as in hotels, making hotel lobby the most likely answer. The mention of spending the night further supports the idea of a hotel lobby. Answer is
hotel lobby
Question: Where is a bridge likely to be found? Options: A: river bed,B: river valley,C: texas,D: california,E: over water,. Knowledge: Bridges are structures that are built to cross over bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans. Therefore, the most likely answer is "over water" because the purpose of a bridge is to provide a safe and stable path over a body of water. The other options may have bodies of water present, but they do not necessarily require a bridge in order to cross or navigate them. Answer is
over water
Question: After studying science for years, what did the agnostic person begin to lose? Options: A: astronomy,B: arts,C: faith,D: math,E: chemistry,.

Question: Billy found it easy to divide 9, because 9 was a what of 3? Options: A: multiply,B: multiple,C: unite,D: multiplication,E: multiple,.

Knowledge: The mention of a band suggests that the event being described was a musical performance, and the fact that the electricity went out indicates that the performance was being held indoors, possibly in a venue that relied on electricity for lighting and sound equipment. The options "building", "bedroom", "opera", and "church" do not necessarily have any connection to a musical performance, while "concert" is the most likely option given the context. Answer is
concert
Question: Where does a potato become softer? Options: A: optical device,B: garden patch,C: blender,D: pantry,E: vegetable stew,. Knowledge: The question is asking where a potato becomes softer, indicating that it is already a potato and needs to be cooked or prepared in some way. The options "optical device," "blender," and "pantry" are clearly not related to the process of cooking or softening a potato. A garden patch is where potatoes are grown, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a potato will become softer by being in the garden. Therefore, the correct answer must be "vegetable stew," which is a dish that involves cooking vegetables, including potatoes, in liquid until they become soft and tender. Answer is
vegetable stew
Question: Someone left their shopping bag behind when they grabbed a bit to eat, where is the bag likely? Options: A: atlantis,B: retail store,C: closet,D: grocery store,E: restaurant,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone forgot their shopping bag when they went to eat. Since the bag was likely intended for carrying items from a shopping trip, it is most likely to be found at a location that is related to shopping. The options "atlantis" and "closet" are unlikely since they are not related to shopping. The option "retail store" is a possibility, but the sentence implies that the person left the bag behind when they left to eat, so they likely did not go to a retail store afterwards. This leaves "grocery store" and "restaurant" as the remaining options, but since the sentence mentions that they grabbed a bit to eat, it is more likely that the bag was left behind at the restaurant rather than the grocery store. Answer is
restaurant
Question: She complained about the radio, what was it doing? Options: A: radiotracking,B: turn on,C: train,D: blaring,E: play music,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the radio was too loud or making too much noise, since the person complained about it. The word "blaring" specifically means to make a loud, harsh, or unpleasant sound, which would fit with the idea of someone complaining about a radio. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, since they either suggest a different action the radio could be doing, or are not related to radio at all. Answer is
blaring
Question: What does the government sometimes have too much of? Options: A: canada,B: trouble,C: city,D: control,E: water,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the government can have an excess of something, and the word "sometimes" suggests that this is not always the case. The other choices, such as "Canada" and "water," do not make sense in this context. "Trouble" and "city" could be possible answers, but the word "sometimes" makes the choice of "control" more likely, as governments are often criticized for over-regulating or exerting too much control over their citizens. Answer is
control
Question: When you drive and see someone walking across the street what do we do? Options: A: reverse,B: stop,C: passenger,D: open the window,E: walking,. Knowledge: When encountering a pedestrian crossing the street while driving, it is important to stop the vehicle to allow them to cross safely.

The option for "passenger" is not related to the situation of encountering a pedestrian, and "open the window" and "walking" are also not relevant. Answer is
stop

Oil refineries have plumbing systems that are primarily used for processing crude oil and other materials, and are not used for providing drinking water.

Answer is
oil refineries

The sentence also mentions that it was easier for the police to interact with the community, which implies that the community was small enough for the police to know the residents personally. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
town

Question: Where is a small dog likely to be well groomed? Options: A: animal shelter,B: backyard,C: park,D: dog show,E: georgia,.

Question: They kept talking during the movie, for others it was quite a what? Options: A: headaches,B: sore throat,C: distraction,D: misunderstandings,E: cell phone,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the people talking during the movie were causing a negative effect for others. Distraction is the most likely option because talking during a movie can be distracting for those trying to watch it. Headaches and sore throat are unlikely because they do not align with the context of the sentence. Misunderstandings and cell phone are also unlikely because they do not fit the context of the sentence either. Answer is
distraction
Question: Where do you find spirits on Halloween? Options: A: liquor cabinet,B: haunted house,C: graveyard,D: cemetary,E: funeral,.

Question: Where is the closest dining table not in your home? Options: A: conference,B: livingroom,C: neighbor's house,D: white house,E: card room,. Knowledge: The question asks for the location of the closest dining table not in the person's home. The options "conference" and "card room" do not typically have dining tables, while the "living room" may have one but it would still be in the person's house. The "white house" is unrelated to the context of the question. The most likely option left is the "neighbor's house," as it suggests a location outside of the person's home where a dining table would be present. Answer is
neighbor's house

eat quickly
Question: Where might a milking machine be located? Options: A: office,B: bar,C: barn,D: industrial area,E: museum,. Knowledge: Milking machines are commonly used in agricultural settings, particularly in barns where cows are milked. The other options, such as an office or a bar, do not have any clear association with milking machines.

Knowledge: The context suggests that the star is lonely and wishing to be a part of something. It is most likely referring to a group or pattern of stars, which is what a constellation is.

constellation

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a teacher is trying to teach or share something with their class. The phrase "better knowledge" implies that the teacher is attempting to improve the students' understanding or increase their knowledge on a particular topic. The other options do not fit the context of a teacher trying to impart knowledge to their class. "Group students" and "time test" do not make sense in this context, and "suffering" and "state facts" do not imply the goal of teaching or sharing knowledge. Answer is
better knowledge

The word "weak" directly contrasts with the idea of strength, and the other answer choices do not fit the context of the sentence. Batman is a fictional character and not relevant to the sentence, while "diluted," "fragile," and "regular" don't provide clear criteria for who needs protection. Answer is
weak
Question: Why should people try learning language for business settings? Options: A: happiness,B: better communication,C: problems,D: confidence,E: comfortness,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that there are advantages to learning a language specifically for business settings. One of the main benefits of learning a language for business is that it can significantly improve communication with foreign clients or partners. This can lead to greater success in negotiations and a more collaborative relationship overall. The other options (happiness, problems, confidence, comfortness) do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence, and are less likely to be a primary reason for learning a language for business.

Stairwells are commonly found in homes with multiple levels and are a likely candidate for where an elderly person may need to install a railing for support.

stairwell

While "pantry" and "storage closet" are both possible options for dry storage, the word "building" is too broad and does not specifically suggest a dry storage environment.

The word "just" indicates that he believes the punishment would be unfair or unjust.

This allows them to see in the dark much better than humans can. Therefore, the most likely feature of a cat that can be seen in the dark would be their eyes. The other options, such as litter of kittens, four legs, nose, and flippers do not have any clear connection to the characteristics of cats that would be visible in the dark. Answer is

This type of wardrobe is more commonly found in larger homes or mansions, where space is not as much of an issue.

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the man was in a hurry, which suggests that he had a destination or goal in mind. The options "run away" and "accident" both suggest negative circumstances, which do not fit the context of the sentence.

Therefore, "get somewhere" is the most reasonable choice. Answer is
get somewhere

The option "read book" fits this description, as it is a quiet and solitary activity that can keep a child occupied for long periods of time. The other options do not fit this description - "brood" implies a negative and introspective state of mind, "become adult" is not an activity but a gradual process of growing up, "ask questions" may require interaction with others and therefore may not be quiet, and "clean room" may require physical activity and make some noise. Answer is

"Dream" and "light way" do not have a clear connection to the concept of faith, and "belief" and "trust" suggest a more intellectual or abstract understanding of faith rather than a personal experience of it.

Knowledge: The sentence states that a cat is a carnivore, which means that they primarily eat meat. This knowledge helps eliminate the choices "get wet," "wool sweater," and "sharp claws" as they are not related to the diet of a cat. The correct choice is "eat vegetables" as it directly contradicts with the fact that a cat is a carnivore since they do not eat vegetables. The final option, "hunt prey," is not the correct answer as it is actually a behavior that is associated with being a carnivore. Answer is
eat vegetables

In an academic setting, it is common for students to raise their hand and ask questions when they do not fully understand a concept or are struggling with a task. This makes "ask questions" the most logical answer choice. "Learn" is not a specific action that serves to address the student's problem, "turn pages" is not necessarily helpful in finding specific information, "death" is completely irrelevant to the context, and "go to school" is too general and doesn't address the specific issue. Answer is
ask questions

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person has a wound that requires urgent care. Urgent care is a medical treatment that requires immediate attention, which would logically lead an individual to go to the emergency room.

Body and patient are not locations and injury does not provide any clear direction as to where to go. Answer is
emergency room

The most common way to do this is by leaving a good review on a website, such as Yelp or Google Reviews.

The phrase "dinged for" implies that this penalty was negative or costly.

Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be "feelings of guilt."

Answer is
feelings of guilt
Question: What could happen after relaxing for a long time by not doing anything? Options: A: shut eyes,B: falling asleep,C: listening to music,D: reading,E: shut eyes,. Knowledge: The sentence uses the word "relaxing" and "not doing anything" together, which suggests a state of relaxation that could lead to sleepiness. The option "shut eyes" is not a plausible answer as it is only a description of a physical action that could happen during relaxation, rather than an outcome. "Listening to music" and "reading" may also be relaxing activities, but they do not necessarily lead to falling asleep. Therefore, "falling asleep" is the correct answer. Answer is
falling asleep
Question: If a beautiful person sprays you with a hose what will you be? Options: A: wet,B: cold,C: dull,D: bad,E: rainy,.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that stress can have a negative impact on a person's mood, and can sometimes lead to a more serious mental health issue such as depression. While stress can manifest in physical symptoms like headaches and high blood pressure, the word "mood" implies a more emotional response. Depression is a common condition associated with prolonged stress, and can have a debilitating impact on a person's mental and physical wellbeing. Fatigue can also be a consequence of stress, but it is not specifically linked to mood changes in the sentence. Heart attacks are a more extreme outcome of high blood pressure, which is not always a direct result of stress. Answer is
depression

The other options, such as feelings, names, and naval, do not have any connection to the context of the sentence and are not related to human anatomy.

bladders

Kneeling is a common physical posture while praying, but it doesn't answer the question about where people go to pray. Ground and ignorance have no clear connection to the context of the question, and while speaking to God can be done anywhere, the question is specifically asking for a location. Answer is
go to church

Board games are commonly played in dens, as they provide a relaxed and social environment for players. A shelf or cupboard may be used to store board games, but they are not typically played on these surfaces. A shower is not an appropriate place to play board games as it is a wet area designed for personal hygiene. "House" is too general and does not provide any contextual clues relevant to the question. Answer is
den
Question: They were surprised that he enjoy rap, but he explained that every genre has what? Options: A: classical,B: country music,C: hip hop,D: rock,E: good music,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being discussed enjoys rap music, which may surprise those around them. However, the person justifies their enjoyment of the genre by suggesting that every genre has good music within it. This implies that the person believes that there is no inherently bad genre of music, but rather that it is a matter of personal taste. The answer choice "good music" reflects this reasoning, while the other options are specific genres that do not necessarily relate to the argument being made. Answer is
good music

While it is possible to have plumbing in a kitchen as well, it is typically a smaller amount and not as complex as the plumbing in a bathroom.

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is

Question: What is a heat source that can be obtained for free? Options: A: bedroom,B: fire,C: car,D: solar energy,E: gasoline,. Knowledge: The question asks for a heat source that can be obtained for free, which eliminates options like gasoline and a car.

airport

Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the speaker is looking for a specific item, an old pie safe with decorative tin.

antique store
Question: Where would you buy an icebox built a hundred years ago? Options: A: kitchen,B: antique store,C: junk yard,D: walmart,E: homes,. Knowledge: An icebox built a hundred years ago is considered an antique item, which means it is likely to be sold in an antique store rather than in a regular store or a junkyard. While it is possible that some people may still have an icebox in their homes, it is unlikely that it would be a hundred years old, and it wouldn't be sold in a kitchen or a Walmart. Answer is
antique store

Knowledge: Sharks are typically found in the open ocean, particularly in deeper waters away from shore. The deep ocean provides a suitable environment for many species of sharks, such as the great white, tiger, and hammerhead sharks. Sea World and maritime museums may have sharks on display, but they are generally not found in these environments naturally. Pet stores would not typically carry sharks, and the Great Barrier Reef is a coral reef ecosystem, not a location commonly associated with sharks, although some species can be found there. Answer is
deep ocean

new york city
Question: What do you do to get ready to compete in body building? Options: A: smart,B: sign up,C: train,D: good at,E: start,.

imagination
Question: What must someone purchase if they plan on going to a play? Options: A: tickets,B: having ticket,C: patience,D: time,E: a hat,. Knowledge: Going to a play requires a ticket to enter the theater and watch the performance. Without a ticket, one would not be allowed to enter the theater. Patience and time may be required for waiting in line or for the play to start, but they are not necessary to purchase. Having a ticket would make sense grammatically, but it is not a commonly used phrase. A hat also does not have any connection to going to a play. Answer is
tickets

overeating
Question: I was creating art, what would be my end product? Options: A: controversy,B: communication,C: feeling of accomplishment,D: strong emotion,E: work of art,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the speaker was engaged in the act of creating art, and therefore the end product would likely be a work of art. The other options are either outcomes that could result from creating art or subjective experiences that the creator might have while making art, but they are not the actual end product of the creative process. The end product of creating art is usually a tangible object, such as a painting, sculpture, or photograph. Answer is
work of art

Question: What do all people have at first but later might not have? Options: A: mentality,B: feelings,C: muscles,D: brains,E: parents,. Knowledge: The question is asking about something that all people have at first but might not have later in life. The option that fits this criterion is 'parents.'

parents
Question: When experiencing loneliness who would be a good person to see? Options: A: socialize,B: meet friend,C: make people laugh,D: make friends,E: get fight,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the solution to loneliness involves spending time with someone else. Out of the options, "meet friend" is the best choice as it specifically mentions seeing someone who you already consider a friend. "Socialize" and "make friends" are possible ways to alleviate loneliness, but in this context, they are not as direct as meeting up with someone you already know. "Make people laugh" and "get fight" are unlikely solutions to loneliness and are not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
meet friend
Question: When getting in shape you need to have this in between workouts? Options: A: give up,B: eat more,C: period of recovery,D: dance,E: jogging,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to get in shape, something is needed in between workouts. This could refer to the fact that the body needs time to rest and recover in order to build muscle and improve fitness. The option "give up" contradicts this idea, while "eat more" may be counterproductive to weight loss goals. "Dance" and "jogging" may be types of workouts, but they do not directly address the need for a period of recovery. Therefore, "period of recovery" is the most appropriate answer. Answer is
period of recovery
Question: Why do people like getting wet in the summer? Options: A: get cold,B: relax,C: catching cold,D: catch cold,E: cooling off,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people enjoy getting wet during the summer season. One possible reason for this is to cool off, as water has a cooling effect on the body. The option "get cold" may be the opposite of what people want during a hot summer day. "Relax" could be a possible reason for getting wet, but it does not necessarily explain why people specifically like getting wet in the summer. "Catching cold" and "catch cold" are essentially the same option and do not make sense in this context as they imply getting sick rather than cooling off. Answer is
cooling off
Question: Where would you get an eyeglasses case if you do not have one? Options: A: factory,B: bag,C: store,D: purse,E: shirt pocket,. Knowledge: The question implies that the person needs to acquire an eyeglasses case, which suggests they do not currently have one. A store is a logical place to look for an eyeglasses case as it is a commonly sold item in stores that sell eyeglasses or accessories. The other options do not seem to be as relevant in this context, as a factory or bag would not necessarily have an eyeglasses case readily available, a purse may or may not be large enough to hold an eyeglasses case, and a shirt pocket may not be a secure or protective enough option for an eyeglasses case. Answer is
store
Question: Sweet is a great taste on its own, but it also goes great with what? Options: A: bitter,B: salty,C: dry,D: sour,E: savory,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that sweet has a complementary taste that goes well with another taste. One common pairing is sweet and sour, as found in many dishes like sweet and sour chicken or sweet and sour sauce. The other options do not have a strong association with sweetness in terms of taste pairing. For example, bitter and sweet are often opposite tastes, while salty and dry do not create a pleasing contrast with sweetness. Answer is
sour

This is a common behavior among cats, as they are known to gravitate towards soft, warm spots in order to rest and relax.

Question: Where are you if a cow you've raised gets an award? Options: A: county fair,B: stable,C: barnyard,D: sheepfold,E: farmyard,. Knowledge: The question implies that the cow getting an award is a significant event, which suggests that it is likely taking place at some kind of competition or exhibition. A county fair is a common event where livestock are showcased and judged, so it is the most likely answer. The other options, such as stable, barnyard, sheepfold, and farmyard, are locations where cows may be kept or raised, but they do not have the same association with awards or competitions. Answer is
county fair
Question: James found two abandoned garbage cans behind an old building.  Where might they have been concealed? Options: A: driveway,B: alley,C: garage,D: street,E: own backyard,. Knowledge: The word "abandoned" suggests that the garbage cans were left in a hidden or obscure place, rather than in a more obvious location like a driveway, garage, or street. The options "alley" and "own backyard" have a stronger association with places where items might be hidden or left out of sight. Answer is

Question: Where can you put leftover soup? Options: A: toilet mug,B: cupboard,C: container,D: supermarket,E: jar,. Knowledge: The question asks for a suitable place to store leftover soup, which suggests that the correct answer needs to be a container or receptacle of some sort. A toilet mug or supermarket are clearly inappropriate options, and a jar may not be large enough to hold the soup. A cupboard is a possible option, but it does not provide an airtight seal and may not keep the soup fresh for very long. Therefore, a container is the most logical and practical choice. Answer is
container
Question: Where might you use a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves? Options: A: loading dock,B: construction site,C: supermarket,D: construction yard,E: warehouse,. Knowledge: Forklifts are commonly used in warehouses to move heavy loads and stack them onto shelves for storage. The other options do not typically involve the need for a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves. A loading dock may involve the use of a forklift to unload or load trucks, but not necessarily to stack boxes. A construction site and yard may use different types of machinery for heavy lifting, but not typically a forklift. A supermarket would not usually require the use of a forklift to stack boxes onto shelves. Answer is
warehouse

Question: What does living life too hard lead to? Options: A: over age,B: early death,C: valuable,D: joy,E: happiness,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that living life too hard has negative consequences. "Early death" is a logical choice because excessive stress, unhealthy behaviors, and reckless decision-making can all contribute to premature mortality. "Over age," "valuable," "joy," and "happiness" do not fit the context and imply a positive outcome, which is not supported by the sentence. Answer is
early death

Knowledge: The word "ping" in the question refers to a message sent from one computer to another to check if the second computer is online and available.

The other options, such as weight gain, nausea, and upset stomach, are unlikely to be associated with a feeling of pleasantness or satisfaction after a meal. "Not hungry" is also not the best option since it does not describe a pleasant sensation, but rather a lack of appetite. Answer is

Question: The teen wanted to impress his girlfriend by doing housework, what impresses the girl? Options: A: boredom,B: chores,C: allergies,D: pain and suffering,E: cleanliness,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the teen wanted to impress his girlfriend by doing housework, so the answer must be related to the concept of housework.

Explanation: The sentence suggests that James enjoys being a judge, but he only has his own perspective to base his judgments on. This implies that James is relying on his personal experience to make judgments, rather than relying on external sources of information. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence in the same way - misperception suggests that James may be making incorrect judgments, knowing yourself implies a level of self-awareness that is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence, ignorance suggests a lack of knowledge or understanding, and a jury would imply a group of people rather than an individual perspective.

This is because many people like to read in bed or have books nearby as they wind down for the night. The bathroom is not a common place for a bookshelf, and neither is a book store or furniture store. While a library would have many bookshelves, it is not a personal location where someone would have their own small bookshelf. Answer is

Question: If something isn't plain but has adornments, what is it called? Options: A: bells and whistles,B: fancy,C: exotic,D: decorative,E: extravagant,.

The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. An arboretum is a place where one would go to see many different types of plants, a family room would typically not have a plant as part of its decor, and a flower garden would not commonly have a ficus tree growing in it.

release energy

The phrase "looked into his girlfriend's eyes" can imply intimacy, and the use of the verb "express" in the last option reinforces the idea that the person wanted to communicate their feelings to their partner. The other options are not related to the context of the sentence. Answer is

The word "imperfect" describes a subject that has flaws or is not ideal, which fits the context of the sentence.

The term "Confederate state" refers specifically to states that seceded from the United States during the Civil War, which occurred in the mid-19th century. The phrase "deep south" is commonly used to refer to the southernmost region of the United States, which includes Louisiana and other states that were part of the Confederacy.

french government
Question: What could snoring cause in rare cases? Options: A: complaining,B: an upset partner,C: disturbed sleep,D: loud noise,E: death,. Knowledge: The question asks about rare consequences of snoring, so the answer is unlikely to be something commonly associated with snoring such as complaining or an upset partner.

Question: The shark was navigating across from the African coast to New York, where was it? Options: A: bathtub,B: seawater,C: atlantic ocean,D: saltwater,E: sea world,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions the shark navigating from the African coast to New York, which suggests that it was traveling across a large body of water. The options "bathtub" and "sea world" are unrealistic as they do not provide enough space for a shark to navigate through. "Seawater" and "saltwater" are properties of the ocean, but do not provide information about the location. "Atlantic ocean" is the most relevant option as it is a large body of water that connects Africa to the United States, which matches the context of the sentence. Answer is

Question: Why would someone think about getting wet in the summer? Options: A: cool off,B: to have fun,C: shrinkage,D: shrinking,E: get cold,.

The other options, such as shrinking or getting cold, do not make sense in the context of summer and getting wet. Answer is
cool off
Question: A cat can't talk, but a cat can what? Options: A: sleep all day,B: meow,C: shed fur,D: see king,E: live many years,. Knowledge: The sentence states that a cat cannot talk, but then suggests that a cat can do something else. One option that cats are well-known for is meowing, which is a sound they use to communicate with humans and other cats. Meowing is a distinctive characteristic of cats and is therefore the correct answer. The other options, while true for cats, do not specifically relate to the sentence's context, making them incorrect answers. Answer is
meow
Question: The ability to remember things is a sign of what? Options: A: neuronal network,B: memories,C: intelligence,D: recall,E: learning about,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that remembering things is a characteristic associated with a certain trait. Intelligence is commonly associated with the ability to remember things because it involves having a sharp mind and quick thinking.

intelligence

Since courthouses are typically considered central institutions in any town or city, the answer that best fits the context of the sentence is the "center of town."

Knowledge: Valleys are typically formed by the erosion or shifting of larger landforms such as mountains or hills. Therefore, it is more likely that a valley would be situated in a mountainous region rather than in a hilly area or a continent. West Virginia may have some mountainous regions, but it is not a general characteristic of the entire state. A peak, on the other hand, refers to the highest point of a mountain and is not usually associated with valleys. Answer is
mountainous region

Being bored and fearful may also occur, but wonder is the most likely and positive experience for a child visiting a museum. Answer is

Knowledge: The question is asking about how to learn the anatomy of a blowfish, which suggests that it may be a topic covered in educational resources such as books. While it is possible to observe a blowfish in its natural habitat in the Atlantic Ocean or at a fish market, these options do not necessarily guarantee a thorough understanding of its anatomy. France and sushi restaurants are not relevant to the context of the question. Therefore, books would be the best option for gaining knowledge about the anatomy of a blowfish. Answer is
books
Question: What does a person do when something is arriving at an undisclosed time? Options: A: washing dishes,B: wait patiently,C: stand erect,D: cross street,E: waiting room,. Knowledge: The phrase "undisclosed time" suggests that the person does not know when the arrival will happen. Therefore, the only logical choice would be to wait patiently. Washing dishes and standing erect are unrelated to the context of waiting for an arrival. Crossing the street is also unlikely to be the correct answer as it does not involve waiting. Waiting room could be a possible answer, but it is less specific and may not be the best fit depending on the context. Answer is
wait patiently
Question: Inside what structure do you normally take a bath? Options: A: room that is upstairs,B: own home,C: hotel room,D: house,E: found in house,.

The options "room that is upstairs," "hotel room," and "found in house" are too vague and do not suggest a clear structure type.

"House" is the most accurate answer, as it specifically refers to a type of building where people typically live and have a bathroom for bathing. Answer is

Anacondas are typically found in tropical regions such as South America, which is likely why John knew that it was unlikely to find one in the Midwest. The other options do not provide any relevant information about anacondas or their habitat. Answer is
tropics
Question: The hobbit was timid in front of the dragon, but what did he have to be to get the gold? Options: A: mean,B: aggressive,C: bellicose,D: reckless,E: dauntless,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the hobbit was facing a challenge or danger, which required him to possess a certain quality to be able to succeed. The word "timid" implies that he may have lacked courage or confidence initially, but to get the gold, he would need to be bold and fearless, hence the correct answer is "dauntless". The other answer choices have negative connotations, such as being mean or reckless, which are unlikely to be desirable traits in this context. Answer is
dauntless
Question: What could someone who give assistance help someone else to be? Options: A: prepared,B: assistant,C: helpful,D: listen,E: help one,.

Answer is
prepared
Question: What happens to most living things after death but not to mummies? Options: A: rebirth,B: last forever,C: sadness,D: burial,E: decomposition,.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
decomposition

Question: James enjoys socializing with people, but sometimes he hates the what? Options: A: having fun,B: jealousy,C: love,D: conflicts,E: friendships,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James likes being around people, but there is something that he doesn't like that may arise from socializing.

As the other options do not involve food or cooking, it can be deduced that the correct answer must be related to food. Additionally, the mention of "wine" as the secret ingredient could indicate that the correct answer involves a savory or Italian cuisine, suggesting that "spaghetti sauce" is the most logical choice. Answer is
spaghetti sauce
Question: Where is the best place to get cheese? Options: A: the moon,B: fridge,C: market,D: pizza,E: refrigerator,. Knowledge: Out of all the choices, only "market" is a place where one can reasonably expect to find a variety of different cheeses for sale. "The moon" is obviously not a practical option, "fridge" and "refrigerator" are household appliances rather than locations, and "pizza" is a food item that may or may not happen to have cheese on it. Therefore, the correct answer is "market" as it is the only option that aligns with the question asked. Answer is
market
Question: A projectile ball is in what after being launched? Options: A: catapult,B: motion,C: flintlock,D: arcade,E: tennis court,. Knowledge: The word "launched" suggests that the ball was thrown or propelled forward, and it is logical that it would be in motion after being launched. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. A catapult is a device used to launch objects, but the sentence suggests that the ball has already been launched. A flintlock is a type of firearm, which does not fit with the description of a projectile ball. Arcade and tennis court are not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
motion

The sentence suggests that he will eventually have to make a decision about the situation he is thinking about.

Question: Where must a car park be? Options: A: city,B: shopping centre,C: downtown,D: outside,E: city center,.

The word "outside" is the only option that makes sense in this context, as car parks are typically located outside of buildings or in designated parking areas on the sides of streets. The other options may have parking areas, but they do not make sense in the context of the question. Answer is

The first player attacks, which means that the second player must defend against the attack. Block and defend are similar in meaning, but block may imply a more active action, while defend is more passive. Surrender, retreat, and cease fire all suggest ending the game or giving up, which is not consistent with the context of taking turns and attacking/defending. Answer is

This group would be called "undecided." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "reject" suggests a negative decision, "predetermination" suggests a decision already made, "force" is not related to decision-making, and "blank" is not commonly used to refer to people who have not made a choice. Answer is
undecided

Question: Where would you be unlikely to find more than one steak house? Options: A: nebraska,B: utah,C: new york,D: city,E: strip mall,. Knowledge: The term "steak house" typically refers to a restaurant that specializes in serving steak, which is a type of meat often associated with high-end dining. However, strip malls are known for having a variety of small storefronts that cater to a wide range of consumer needs, often including fast food and casual dining options. Therefore, it is unlikely that a strip mall would have more than one steak house, as it would not necessarily be the ideal location for this type of fine dining establishment to succeed. The other options are all locations where one might reasonably expect to find multiple steak houses, depending on the size of the city or the preferences of the local population. Answer is
strip mall
Question: Where would a person go for a wound that is urgent? Options: A: battle,B: hurt,C: emergency room,D: injured person,E: hospital,. Knowledge: The word "urgent" suggests that the wound requires immediate attention, which is typically provided in an emergency room. A hospital or injured person could refer to a variety of medical situations, not just urgent wounds.

"Battle" is not a medical location, but rather a description of a specific type of conflict. Answer is

Knowledge: Frogs are known to move on land by hopping, which involves pushing off the ground with their back legs and landing on their front legs. Jumping several feet is unlikely since frogs are not capable of sustained flight. Swimming is how frogs move through water, not on land. Leaping is similar to jumping and also unlikely for a short distance. Walking is not a typical form of movement for frogs as their legs are adapted for jumping and hopping in water and on land. Answer is
hop
Question: A person achieved success and was what by his peers? Options: A: critical thinking,B: congratulated,C: kick him,D: equal opportunity,E: own house,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person achieved a positive outcome and was recognized by their peers in response.

The gear shift is a crucial part of the bike that allows the rider to change gears and adjust their speed.

The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
gear shift

Question: What does someone do before they travel to work? Options: A: wake up,B: have job,C: message the boss,D: get ready,E: take bus,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is preparing to leave for work, so "get ready" is the most appropriate choice. "Wake up" is too general and could refer to any time of day, "have job" is not an action someone does before leaving for work, "message the boss" is not a common task before leaving for work, and "take bus" may not apply to everyone, as some people might drive or walk to work. Answer is
get ready

Question: Where is it especially important to keep a dry, clean floor? Options: A: bed,B: restaurant,C: synagogue,D: wedding,E: all buildings,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that having a dry, clean floor is particularly crucial in one specific type of building. Restaurants are places where food is prepared and served, and any spills or wetness on the floor can pose a safety hazard for both employees and customers. In contrast, places like beds, synagogues, and weddings do not necessarily have the same level of risk associated with a wet or dirty floor. The option "all buildings" is too broad and generalizes the sentence's meaning. Answer is
restaurant

Question: What happens when I make a pig of myself eating breakfast? Options: A: full stomach,B: gain energy,C: dieting,D: have energy,E: feeling satisfied,. Knowledge: The phrase "make a pig of myself" suggests overeating or indulging in an excessive amount of food. Therefore, the most likely outcome would be a full stomach. The other options, such as gaining energy or feeling satisfied, do not align with the context of overindulging. Dieting, on the other hand, is the opposite of overeating and would therefore not be the correct answer. Answer is

movie
Question: What public house might you expect to hear someone play the harp? Options: A: music shop,B: auditorium,C: ochestra,D: concert hall,E: irish bar,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the harp is commonly played at a specific type of establishment. This is likely to be an Irish bar, as the harp is an important symbol of Irish culture and is often associated with traditional Irish music. Other options, such as a music shop or auditorium, are not specifically linked to the harp and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer. Answer is
irish bar

Question: When he won the dance competition he immediately praised his what? Options: A: moving,B: am happy,C: talent,D: partner,E: sitting still,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the subject is referring to someone they worked closely with during the dance competition. Praise for one's own moving abilities, happiness, or talent would not typically be phrased in this way, and sitting still is clearly not relevant to a dance competition. Therefore, it is most likely that the subject is praising their dance partner for their part in the victory. Answer is
partner

Diet is also important for overall health, but it alone may not result in weight loss without exercise. Answer is

Knowledge: The question implies that praying is possible even if someone is paralyzed, which means it does not require physical movement. Speaking to god is a common way of communicating with him during prayer, and this would not be impeded by paralysis.

Praise for god and sincere prayers are important components of prayer, but they do not specifically address the issue of paralysis. Answer is

public building

This suggests that the answer should not involve electronics or power, ruling out options like power grid and roulette wheel.

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - "garish" means overly colorful or flashy, "bright" is a synonym of intelligent rather than inexperienced, "make invisible" is not related to Billy's situation, and "backward" suggests a lack of intelligence rather than a lack of experience. Answer is

While scissors are also important, they are typically used for more precise cuts and shaping rather than the initial cut.

An aircraft carrier and a destroyer are both larger and more powerful than a battleship, with different functions and purposes.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John lives in a remote and isolated location where farming is no longer a prominent activity. This description matches the characteristics of a rural area, which is typically an area that is sparsely populated and dominated by agricultural or natural landscapes. The other options do not align with the context of the sentence, as they either describe a specific type of building or location or do not meet the criteria of being remote and without farming activity. Answer is
rural area
Question: Why do people participate in exercising? Options: A: tiredness,B: exhaustion,C: get sick,D: become stronger,E: use energy,. Knowledge: Exercise is commonly associated with building strength and improving overall physical fitness. The other options, such as tiredness, exhaustion, getting sick, or using energy, do not directly relate to the benefits of exercise. In fact, exercising can actually help combat fatigue and increase energy levels. Therefore, the most logical answer is that people participate in exercising to become stronger and healthier. Answer is
become stronger
Question: What about you will decrease after you exercise for many months? Options: A: work out,B: blood,C: expend energy,D: stretch,E: weigh,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that exercising for many months will cause a decrease in something, which is most likely a physical change in the body. The term "weigh" is the only option that specifically refers to a physical measurement of the body, while the other options have more general or nebulous meanings. "Stretch" and "work out" may actually increase rather than decrease with exercise, while "expend energy" and "blood" are not necessarily associated with a change in weight. Answer is
weigh
Question: She had worked hard her whole life saving money, featuring her dream entrance hall she bought a new what? Options: A: hat rack,B: school,C: large home,D: palace,E: gateway,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person has saved up enough money to buy something significant. The mention of a dream entrance hall suggests that the purchase is related to a dwelling place and the use of the word "bought" indicates a purchase. "Hat rack" and "school" do not fit the context of purchasing a large home, while "palace" seems too grandiose for the given information. "Gateway" is also unlikely since it does not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
large home
Question: The friends gathered around the table to play cards and what? Options: A: drink,B: have fun,C: remember,D: bored,E: good at,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the friends gathered to engage in an enjoyable activity, which is commonly associated with playing cards.

The other options are not consistent with the context of the sentence; for example, there is no indication that the friends were drinking alcohol or feeling bored. Answer is
have fun
Question: WHat could prevent someone from the ability to buy a house? Options: A: bargain,B: pay for,C: settle down,D: lose money,E: too far away,. Knowledge: The question is asking for a factor that could prevent someone from being able to buy a house. Losing money is a common reason for many people not being able to afford a home.

Answer is
lose money

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is hungry in the evening, which is typically a time when people eat dinner. The phrase "cook dinner" specifically refers to the action of preparing a meal at home, which is a common activity for people who are hungry in the evening. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either refer to meals at different times of day or involve going outside of the house to eat. Answer is
cook dinner
Question: What can an injury cause that is messy? Options: A: cause bleeding,B: become infected,C: distress,D: cause death,E: hurts,. Knowledge: The word "messy" suggests that the injury can cause some sort of bodily fluid or substance to be present, which would be the case with bleeding. Infections and distress may not necessarily be messy, and while death may result from an injury, the term "messy" does not necessarily describe the outcome. "Hurts" is too general and could apply to any injury, but it does not necessarily imply messiness. Answer is
cause bleeding
Question: If you're typing for a long time, what's a sign you should take a break? Options: A: pain,B: carpal tunnel syndrome,C: letter,D: thirst,E: printed word,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that typing for a long time can be physically demanding and potentially harmful. Pain is a common signal from the body indicating that it is under stress or strain, and thus taking a break is necessary. Carpal tunnel syndrome is also a potential health risk associated with typing and can cause pain, but it is a specific medical condition rather than a general sign one should take a break. Letter, thirst, and printed word are not related to the physical stress associated with typing. Answer is
pain
Question: Where are trees likely to line a road? Options: A: countryside,B: state park,C: forest,D: garden,E: yard,. Knowledge: Trees are often planted along rural roads, especially those located in the countryside, to provide shade and create a pleasing aesthetic.

Gardens and yards may have trees, but they are not typically planted along roadsides. Answer is
countryside
Question: What is someone having a hard time learning abut science likely to experience? Options: A: smiles,B: frustration,C: accidents,D: become happy,E: experiment,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone is struggling to learn about science, which suggests that they may feel frustrated. Learning can be a difficult process, and science is a complex subject that requires a lot of effort and dedication to master. Smiling or becoming happy may be unlikely responses to struggling with science, while accidents and experimentation are not related to the emotional experience of learning. Answer is
frustration
Question: If you are prescribed an antibiotic by your doctor, where would you go to get it? Options: A: doctor,B: prescribed,C: pharmacy,D: medicine cabinet,E: capsule,. Knowledge: When a doctor prescribes medication, it means they are recommending a specific type and dosage of medication for a patient's health condition.

The other options do not accurately reflect the proper process of obtaining a prescription antibiotic. Answer is
pharmacy
Question: John refused to sleep because of Freddy.   Nothing can hurt you as long as you do what? Options: A: vacuuming,B: being awake,C: wakefulness,D: stay awake,E: entertainment,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is afraid of something that may harm him while he is sleeping, so he chooses to stay awake instead.

stay awake

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are many grains of sand being referred to, which when put together, form something. The only option that matches this description is "sand pile."

sand pile
Question: John walked into the courtyard of a famous palace.  Where might he be? Options: A: spain,B: versailles,C: courtroom,D: office complex,E: lawn,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John may be in a palace, which immediately rules out options such as a courtroom or office complex. The mention of a courtyard and a famous palace suggests that the location may be a historical landmark or tourist attraction. Spain, while it does have many famous palaces, is a broad option and therefore less likely to be the correct answer. Finally, the option "lawn" is clearly not the correct answer as it does not fit with the context of the sentence. This leaves "versailles" as the most likely option since it is known as a famous palace with a well-known courtyard. Answer is
versailles
Question: Animals do what from birth to death? Options: A: fight each other,B: need to eat,C: drink water,D: live lives,E: feel pain,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the topic is the entire life cycle of animals.

live lives
Question: The employee was stocking product, where did he put it? Options: A: display case,B: demonstration,C: market,D: store,E: shelf,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the employee was stocking a product, which typically involves placing it on a designated surface for customers to access. In a store setting, products are often stocked on shelves, making it the most likely option in this context. The other choices, such as display case and demonstration, do not fit the typical method of stocking a product in a retail setting. Market and store are too general and do not provide enough specific information to help make a choice. Answer is
shelf
Question: Where can you take your automobile to go as fast as you can? Options: A: garage,B: parkling lot,C: freeway,D: racetrack,E: side of road,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is asking about a place where they can drive their car at high speeds. A racetrack is a common place for car racing or high-performance driving, where drivers can push their cars to their limits in a controlled environment. The other options do not provide a suitable location for high-speed driving. A garage or parking lot are confined spaces, while a freeway and side of the road have speed limits and regulations that prohibit reckless driving. Answer is
racetrack
Question: What is a place that has only one ceiling and which could be on ground level? Options: A: house,B: building,C: loft,D: classroom,E: airplane,. Knowledge: The question is asking for a place with a single ceiling that can also be located on the ground level. This rules out options such as airplanes, which have multiple levels and are not on the ground, and lofts, which are typically located aboveground. A house or building may have multiple ceilings, so those options can also be eliminated. A classroom, on the other hand, typically has a single ceiling and can be located on the ground level, making it the correct answer. Answer is
classroom
Question: What could happen if something surprising happens while you are driving? Options: A: faint,B: accidents,C: frightened,D: laughter,E: funny,. Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of a surprising event occurring while driving. One possible consequence is that it could lead to accidents, as unexpected events can cause drivers to lose control of their vehicles or collide with other cars.

Answer is
accidents
Question: What is the result of reaching a tentative agreement? Options: A: communicate with,B: settlement,C: shake hands,D: celebration,E: part ways,. Knowledge: A tentative agreement usually means that parties involved have come to an understanding, but are not yet fully committed. A settlement, on the other hand, means that the agreement has been finalized and legally binding. The other choices, such as communication or celebration, do not necessarily indicate a finalized agreement. Parting ways also suggests that the negotiation did not reach a successful conclusion. Shaking hands may symbolize agreement, but it does not necessarily mean that a final decision has been reached. Answer is
settlement
Question: What else might one feel when hurting? Options: A: death,B: feel sad,C: more hurt,D: punishment,E: accident,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hurting is associated with an emotional response, which is likely to be negative since the choices include "death," "punishment," and "accident." "More hurt" is also a possible response to hurting, but it is not a valid answer to the question because it is a physical response rather than an emotional one. "Feel sad" is the most appropriate answer because it aligns with the emotional connotations of the sentence. Answer is
feel sad
Question: If diamonds are not free nor cheap, what are they? Options: A: enslaved,B: free with coupon.,C: expensive,D: paid for,E: imprisoned,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that diamonds have a high value because they are neither free nor cheap. The term "expensive" is commonly associated with objects that have a high monetary value.

Knowledge: When making chicken salad, the chicken is typically cooked first and then chopped or shredded into smaller pieces before being mixed with the other ingredients. Baking, grilling, or buying pre-cooked chicken at the store would not necessarily result in the chicken being in smaller pieces. "Eaten" is not a method of preparing the chicken. Therefore, "chopped" is the most likely correct answer. Answer is
chopped
Question: What do you need to do to keep a surprise party a surprise? Options: A: keep secret,B: laugh,C: enjoy,D: scare,E: send flowers,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in order to keep a surprise party a surprise, one needs to do something specific.

Knowledge: Inflation is often accompanied by rising prices, which can lead to an increase in interest rates. This is because the central bank may raise interest rates to control inflation by reducing the amount of money in circulation. A higher interest rate makes borrowing more expensive, which can help to curb spending and reduce inflation. Therefore, being aware of rising interest rates is important when fighting inflation. The other options do not have a clear connection to inflation and loans. Answer is
rising interest rates

injuries

pet store

Knowledge: Passengers who are planning to travel to another continent are most likely to be found at an airport.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to keep the antibiotic out of reach of children, implying that it should be stored in a secure location. A medicine cabinet is a common location for storing medications that need to be kept out of reach of children. Storing the antibiotic in the stomach or a capsule does not make sense as these are not storage locations, and being prescribed or coming from a pharmacy does not provide any information about where to store the medication. Answer is
medicine cabinet

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the symbol on the bottom of the glass bottle is related to its properties or intended use. The options "combustible," "dirty," and "very fragile" do not seem relevant in this context, while "clear" is a characteristic of glass that does not require a symbol to indicate it. Therefore, it is likely that the symbol indicates that the bottle can be recycled, which is a common practice for glass containers. Answer is
recyclable
Question: What would you be doing if you are having lunch? Options: A: eating,B: hunger,C: burp,D: laughing,E: food,. Knowledge: The question is asking about an action that is typically associated with having lunch. Eating is the most logical choice as it is the main activity that usually takes place during a meal.

Burping and laughing are unrelated to the act of having lunch, while food is a broad category that could refer to any aspect of a meal. Answer is
eating

runway

Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions and are known to burrow in the ground or rocks. Therefore, the option "wilderness" seems like the most appropriate choice as it is a vast area of undeveloped land with diverse terrain and vegetation which can provide a suitable habitat for marmots to thrive. The other options such as "jungle" or "new zealand" do not align with the natural habitat of marmots. Answer is
wilderness
Question: What would be a cheap way for a medieval family to satisfy their hunger? Options: A: go to the store,B: make bread,C: bring home fish,D: go to market,E: eat hamburger,. Knowledge: The question is asking for a cheap way for a medieval family to satisfy their hunger, which suggests that they may not have had access to a lot of money or resources. Making bread is a simple and inexpensive way to feed a family, as it only requires basic ingredients like flour, water, yeast, and salt. Going to the store, going to the market, or bringing home fish may not have been viable options for a medieval family depending on their location, income, and availability of resources. Eating a hamburger is not a plausible option because hamburgers did not exist during medieval times. Answer is
make bread

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill struggles with riding his bike uphill, indicating that it requires a significant amount of physical exertion. The phrase "pushed himself to the point of" implies that Bill's physical activity was so strenuous that it caused him to experience a negative consequence. "Exhaustion" is the only choice that accurately reflects the consequences of over-exertion, while "falling down", "give up", "travelling", and "going somewhere" do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
exhaustion
Question: When you play chess and work hard to improve at it, and finally have it pay off you will feel what? Options: A: smart,B: have fun,C: made,D: satisfaction,E: superior,. Knowledge: The question suggests that the feeling one experiences after working hard to improve at chess and succeeding is related to a sense of achievement or fulfillment. The choice "satisfaction" best captures this idea. "Smart" may be a feeling one experiences after successfully solving a challenging problem or learning something new, but it is not necessarily the feeling associated with improving at chess. "Have fun" is not the most fitting choice as it does not reflect the idea of hard work paying off. "Made" is not a feeling, it is a verb. "Superior" is not the most fitting choice as it implies a sense of dominance or superiority over others, which may not be the case in this scenario. Answer is
satisfaction

Answer is
own home

While it is possible that someone may feel scared or worried about getting caught and going to jail, the term "remorse" specifically refers to a feeling of deep regret or guilt about a past action, which is more likely to apply to someone who has taken another person's life. The term "horrible" is also associated with negative emotions, but it is not specific enough to the context of the question. The other options do not accurately reflect the potential emotional response to killing someone. Answer is
remorse

"Anger" and "hatred" may be emotions that the injured party may feel, but they do not describe the physical or emotional pain that results from being hurt. Answer is
suffering

Question: In the video game he used the rocket launcher at long range, but up close he would switch to the rapid fire what? Options: A: pistol,B: assault rifle,C: submachine gun,D: grenade launcher,E: shotgun,.

However, when the player was up close, they switched to a weapon with a fast firing rate, suggesting that they needed to take out enemies quickly. The assault rifle, submachine gun, and shotgun all have rapid fire capabilities, but the shotgun is typically used for close-range combat, making it an unlikely choice. The pistol and grenade launcher do not have the rapid firing capabilities suggested in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is submachine gun. Answer is
submachine gun

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the painting was created while the person was feeling angry, which is likely to have influenced the resulting artwork. Anger is a strong emotion, and it is likely that the painting conveyed this emotion inadvertently. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence - while creating art can be a work of art, a feeling of accomplishment or pleasure, these options do not connect with the fact that the creator was angry while making it. Making love is also a completely unrelated option that does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is

Options: A: opaque,B: opal,C: obscured,D: obscure,E: thick,. Knowledge: The context suggests that the paint that Jim considered using would have covered up the natural beauty of the wood. This implies that the paint is not transparent and therefore, opaque would be the best answer. Opal refers to a type of gemstone and does not make sense in this context. Obscured and obscure mean to make unclear or difficult to understand, and thick does not necessarily imply that the paint would cover up the natural beauty of the wood. Answer is
opaque
Question: He was washing hands, what happened to his hands as a result? Options: A: jazz hands,B: health,C: become wet,D: skin irritation,E: dry skin,. Knowledge: The sentence states that the person was washing their hands, which implies that their hands became wet as a result. The other options do not make sense in the context of washing hands. "Jazz hands" is a type of dance move and has nothing to do with washing hands. "Health" is a broad and vague option that does not provide enough context to make sense as an answer choice. "Skin irritation" and "dry skin" may be possible outcomes of washing hands with harsh soaps or chemicals, but the sentence does not provide any indication that this is what happened. Answer is
become wet
Question: The muscle stretched, and after it did what? Options: A: popped,B: loose,C: compressing,D: contract,E: cramped,. Knowledge: The sentence describes a muscle, and the word "stretched" implies that it was previously extended or lengthened.

The other options do not fit with what typically happens to a muscle after it has been stretched. Answer is
contract
Question: Why would someone fail after giving an answer? Options: A: problem,B: question,C: wrong,D: ask,E: swear,.

wrong

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the drunk man was angry or frustrated, and he expressed this emotion by slamming a bottle down on something. The most logical option is the table, as it is a common object that can be found near someone who is drinking. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence; buying beer and getting a ticket are unrelated to the man's behavior, aim is not a tangible object, and breaking is a consequence of the man's action rather than the target of it. Answer is

Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about something that can be used to carry a small dog, so options like swimming pool, dog show, backyard, and own home do not make logical sense.

Question: If people are at war with one another, what might they do as a consequence? Options: A: destroy each other,B: interact,C: talk to each other,D: run amok,E: desire to win,. Knowledge: The phrase "at war with one another" implies a violent conflict, which often leads to actions such as destruction and aggression. "Interact" and "talk to each other" are not likely scenarios in the context of war, as the parties involved are typically not in a position to negotiate or communicate effectively. "Run amok" is a vague term that does not provide enough context to indicate a logical consequence of war. "Desire to win" is a general statement that could apply to many situations, but it does not specifically address the consequences of war. Answer is
destroy each other
Question: The local place didn't have the variety the customer was after, so he traveled to see the show room in the big what? Options: A: dancehall,B: car dealership,C: theater,D: city,E: vegas,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the customer was looking for a larger selection or more options than what was available locally, and this implies that the customer was looking for a bigger selection offered in a more populous area. The urban connotation of "city" fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options have limited relevance to the context, as a dancehall and theater refer to specific types of buildings, a car dealership refers to a specific type of business, and Vegas, short for Las Vegas, would not be considered a local place for most people. Answer is
city
Question: What might happen to someone if they were found guilty of committing perjury? Options: A: embarrassment,B: mistrial,C: going to jail,D: laywer,E: tension,. Knowledge: Perjury is a serious crime that involves lying under oath in a legal setting. If someone is found guilty of committing perjury, they may face legal consequences such as fines, probation, or even imprisonment. Going to jail is a common punishment for this offense. Embarrassment and tension may also be feelings that someone experiences in relation to committing perjury, but they are not legal consequences. Mistrial is also not a direct consequence of perjury, but rather a legal decision to invalidate a trial due to some other issue. A lawyer is not a consequence, but rather someone who may be involved in defending or prosecuting a case involving perjury. Answer is
going to jail

The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
become broken
Question: As you live life you get wiser, it is a part of what? Options: A: growing older,B: death,C: experience things,D: toothsome,E: breathe,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that wisdom is acquired over time, which implies that the person is aging and accumulating life experience. The phrase "as you live life" also supports this idea. The other options, such as toothsome and breathe, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
growing older
Question: Ballet dancing is a form of artistic what? Options: A: swan lake,B: intercourse,C: expression,D: become tired,E: fatigue,. Knowledge: Ballet dancing is a form of artistic expression, where dancers use their bodies to convey emotions, tell stories, and express themselves. Swan Lake is a famous ballet, but it is not a broader category that could be used to describe ballet dancing as a whole. Intercourse and fatigue have no connection to ballet dancing or artistic expression, and "become tired" is not a category that could be used to describe any form of dance. Answer is
expression
Question: John heard loud noise coming from below him, which was perfectly normal.   It always happened this time of day.  He really hated living here.  Where did he live? Options: A: upstream,B: roof,C: aloft,D: upstairs,E: upwards,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John heard a loud noise coming from below him, indicating that he is living in a multi-level building. The phrase "perfectly normal" suggests that the noise is a regular occurrence, and it happens at a specific time of the day. The phrase "he really hated living here" implies that John is not happy with his living situation. Based on these clues, the correct answer is "upstairs," as it is the only option that is related to living in a building with multiple levels. The other options do not make sense in this context. Answer is
upstairs
Question: Where can you see people enjoying antique transportation? Options: A: synagogue,B: montana,C: carnival,D: supermarket,E: car show,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are experiencing antique transportation as a form of entertainment.

Question: What happens when you play games? Options: A: bored,B: have fun,C: win,D: challenge,E: bored,. Knowledge: Playing games is often associated with enjoyment and entertainment, which is typically described as "having fun." While some games can be challenging or competitive, the primary purpose of playing games is usually to engage in an enjoyable activity. The option "bored" is listed twice, making it an unlikely correct answer as it does not offer any new information. "Win" and "challenge" may also be possible outcomes of playing games, but they do not capture the essence of the experience in the same way "having fun" does. Answer is
have fun
Question: When people aren't communicating or talking to each other, what happens? Options: A: misunderstandings,B: headaches,C: introductions,D: conversation,E: distraction,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when people are not communicating or talking to each other, something negative happens. The word "misunderstandings" implies a lack of clear communication between individuals, which can lead to confusion and conflict. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not relate to the negative effects of a lack of communication. Answer is
misunderstandings
Question: Beer is usually expensive when you attend what public event? Options: A: refrigerator,B: drink,C: fridge,D: sporting event,E: bowling alley,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cost of beer is higher at a certain type of public event.

sporting event
Question: When you see new people move in next door you might find it what? Options: A: new friends,B: new experience,C: look around,D: change of surroundings,E: interesting,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that seeing new people move in next door will elicit a certain response. The word "interesting" implies that there is a level of curiosity or intrigue involved. The other options may be possible, but do not capture the sense of curiosity suggested by the sentence. "New friends" assumes a positive outcome that may not always occur, "new experience" is too vague and could refer to any number of things, "look around" is not a response but rather an action that may occur as a result, and "change of surroundings" may not necessarily be interesting. Answer is
interesting
Question: Two adults do what before one gives birth to a child? Options: A: loving couple,B: act of sex,C: birth,D: parents,E: consent,. Knowledge: Based on common knowledge and biology, it is known that two adults engage in sexual intercourse before the woman gives birth to a child. The other options do not accurately describe the process that leads to childbirth. "Loving couple" and "consent" may be necessary factors for healthy and consensual sexual intercourse, but they do not directly answer the question. "Birth" and "parents" refer to the end result and relationship status, respectively, rather than the action that precedes childbirth. Answer is
act of sex
Question: If people are busy, what do they tend to do? Options: A: make lists,B: trade places,C: talk to each other,D: hurry along,E: say "hello" to one another,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that when people are busy, they tend to do something in response. "Hurry along" is the most logical choice as it implies a sense of urgency and rapid movement, which is a common response to being busy. The other options do not make as much sense in the context of being busy. Making lists may be a response to being organized, but not necessarily busy. Trading places and talking to each other do not necessarily indicate a response to busyness. Saying "hello" to one another may indicate social interaction, but not necessarily a response to busyness. Answer is
hurry along

Knowledge: The word "inebriated" is commonly used to describe the state of being drunk or intoxicated. People who are drunk often have difficulty maintaining their balance and walking in a straight line, leading to a staggering or swaying movement. Jumping and fighting are not necessarily associated with being drunk, and paralysis would make it impossible for the person to move at all. Answer is
staggering

Knowledge: The sentence states that Mary is a high school student, which indicates that she is most likely attending classes in a school. The sentence also suggests that Mary was studying, which further supports the idea that she was in a classroom or library, both of which are common places for students to study. The other options, such as university, dinner, or every aspect of life, do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
classroom
Question: She had a busy schedule, she had to run errands and pick up the kids the second she did what? Options: A: make time for,B: take money,C: go outdoors,D: leave work,E: field,. Knowledge: The sentence states that the woman had a busy schedule and needed to run errands and pick up her kids "the second she did" something. This implies that whatever she did would directly affect her ability to complete her tasks. Choosing "leave work" makes the most sense in this context, as leaving work would give her the time to run her errands and pick up her kids. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
leave work
Question: He waited far to long before beginning work. What is his immediate state of mind? Options: A: stress,B: excitement,C: eagerness,D: panic,E: working,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person waited too long before starting work, which implies that they are now in a state of urgency, potentially experiencing stress or panic. Excitement and eagerness may be associated with starting work, but the phrase "waited too long" suggests a negative connotation, ruling those answers out. "Working" is a state of action, not a state of mind. Answer is
panic

captivity
Question: What would be built on a foundation of rock? Options: A: pillars,B: mountains,C: bridge,D: mountain range,E: surface of earth,. Knowledge: Bridges are typically built on strong foundations that can support the weight of the structure and withstand the forces of nature. Foundations made of rock are often preferred because they provide stability and durability. Pillars may also be built on rock foundations, but they are typically smaller structures than bridges. Mountains and mountain ranges are natural features that are not built by humans, and the surface of the earth is too broad to be considered a foundation for a specific structure. Answer is
bridge
Question: He tried to jump his car, what terminal did he connect to after connecting the positive terminal? Options: A: bad,B: uncertain,C: possimism,D: negative,E: adverse,. Knowledge: When jumping a car, the positive terminal of a live battery is connected to the positive terminal of the dead battery, and then the negative terminal of the live battery is connected to a metal ground point on the dead car (such as a bolt or a metal surface). Therefore, after connecting the positive terminal, the next step is to connect the negative terminal. The term "negative" is also commonly used to refer to the negative terminal of a battery, making it a logical choice for the answer. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
negative

tree
Question: The housewife needed dry storage, where should she put her things? Options: A: storage closet,B: building,C: inside,D: warehouse,E: pantry,.

A pantry is typically a cool, dry place designed for storing food items such as canned goods, cereal, and non-perishables. A storage closet may also be dry, but it's not typically associated with food storage. A building or warehouse may not have the right conditions for dry storage, and "inside" is too general and does not provide enough context. Answer is
pantry

Knowledge: A cupboard is a type of storage unit often found in kitchens that typically contains plates, bowls, and other kitchenware.

cupboard

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people have differing opinions, which implies that they are in a position to agree or disagree with one another.

agree or disagree

The idea of giving money to someone in exchange for good things happening is often associated with religious practices, such as tithing. The other options, such as a stadium, hockey game, baseball game, or movie theater, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
church
Question: Joe wants to stop being married to Jane.  Jane doesn't want it, but she sadly accepts what? Options: A: pleasure,B: getting divorce,C: heartache,D: heartbreak,E: beatings,. Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that Joe wants to end his marriage to Jane, which suggests that they are discussing a divorce. The option "getting divorce" directly addresses this point and is therefore the correct answer. The other options, such as "pleasure" and "beatings," do not make sense in the context of this sentence and can be eliminated as incorrect answers. "Heartache" and "heartbreak" could potentially make sense, but they do not directly address the specific action that Jane is accepting (i.e. a divorce). Answer is
getting divorce
Question: When trying to clean clothes, what is something that you need? Options: A: get dirty,B: launder,C: sort,D: bleach,E: use water,. Knowledge: Water is an essential element when it comes to cleaning clothes. It is used to rinse out stains and dirt from fabric, especially when combined with detergent. While sorting may be helpful in organization, it is not a necessary step in cleaning clothes. Bleach is a type of cleaning agent that may be used in some cases, but not in all, and getting dirty is the opposite of cleaning. Laundering is the process of cleaning clothes, so it is not a necessary item you need in addition to water. Answer is
use water
Question: The screwdriver was surprisingly sharp.  This is because it's tip  was what? Options: A: blunt,B: inaccurate,C: flat,D: above board,E: dim,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the screwdriver was unexpectedly sharp, which may indicate that it was not designed to be sharp. The word "sharp" in this context typically refers to a point or edge that can pierce or cut through objects. In contrast, the word "flat" means lacking in sharpness, which could explain why the screwdriver's surprisingly sharp tip was unexpected. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
flat
Question: Where could I eat a chocolate cake? Options: A: mouth,B: restaurant,C: supermarket,D: school,E: box,. Knowledge: The word "eat" implies that the chocolate cake is a food item meant for consumption. While it may be possible to eat a chocolate cake at home from a box, the other options (mouth, school, and supermarket) are not feasible locations to eat a chocolate cake. A restaurant is a likely choice because it is a place where food is served and eaten. Therefore, the correct answer is "restaurant." Answer is
restaurant

Knowledge: A cabinet is a piece of furniture used for storage, typically in a kitchen or dining area. It would be a logical place to put a drink if you do not plan to use it soon, as it could be kept out of the way and protected from spills or other accidents. The other options do not make as much sense in this context. A camelback is a type of hydration pack worn on the back, a cup and can are both used to drink from, and a backpack is for carrying items, not storing drinks. Answer is
cabinet

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that eating only ice cream is not a healthy choice when one is hungry. This implies that there are healthier food options available when one is hungry.

The option of exercising may be a healthy choice but it is not suggested as an alternative in the sentence. Answer is
were hungry
Question: What will an unprepared person experience when taking final exams? Options: A: graduation,B: anxiety,C: happy,D: graduating,E: headaches,. Knowledge: The use of the word "unprepared" suggests that the person taking the final exams is not ready for the test. This could lead to feelings of stress, nervousness, and anxiety. Graduation and graduating are not relevant because they suggest a task that has already been completed (not something that is about to be undertaken). Happy is not relevant because the sentence is discussing a negative emotion, and headaches may be a side effect of stress but are not the main focus of this sentence. Answer is
anxiety
Question: The champagne was good, it was both sweet and what? Options: A: bitter,B: decaying,C: spicy,D: sour,E: dry,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the champagne had a sweet taste as well as another quality that is complementary to sweetness. The opposite of sweet is often considered to be sour, bitter, or spicy, which do not fit with the context of the sentence. Decaying is not a taste, and therefore cannot be the correct answer. Dryness is often used to describe the taste of champagne and is a common characteristic of high-quality sparkling wines. Therefore, dry is the correct answer. Answer is
dry
Question: When picking up drinks, what kind requires you to hold them by the neck? Options: A: glass,B: shoulder,C: body,D: guillotine,E: bottle,. Knowledge: Bottles typically have a narrower neck and wider body, making it necessary to hold them by the neck to ensure a firm grip. Holding a glass by the neck doesn't make much sense, as glasses are typically wider at the base, and holding them by the neck would result in an unstable grip. "Shoulder" and "body" are not descriptors of a type of drink, and "guillotine" is not related to drinks at all, so the correct answer is "bottle". Answer is
bottle
Question: Where would be a good place for a weasel to hide? Options: A: children's story,B: animated film,C: henhouse,D: mulberry bush,E: bank,.

Out of the choices given, only "name" fits this criteria as wolves do not typically have names, while humans are commonly given names. The other choices, such as "human intelligence," "hide," "mouth," and "heart" may be traits that both humans and wolves have in common. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needed a computer program to complete a task, and he had the knowledge of how to make it. Therefore, he would logically start to write code in order to create the program. Debugging comes after writing code and refers to the process of finding and fixing errors in the code. Getting frustrated or damaging the computer are unlikely actions one would take in this situation. Compiling is the process of turning code into a program, but it is done after writing and debugging the code. Answer is
write code

When people are in a convivial setting, they tend to be open and receptive to meeting new people, which can lead to the formation of friendships. The other choices (expect miracles, think of life, talk to each other, arguments) do not necessarily pertain to the context of the sentence, and do not align with the expectation of a convivial setting. Answer is
form friendships

The other options do not accurately convey the meaning of the sentence. Answer is

Options: A: side with opponent,B: football,C: hockey game,D: part two boxers,E: sporting event,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the referee is skilled in refereeing various games and has been offered a job that he is unsure of. The fact that the job offer doesn't specify a particular game suggests that it could be a position in a general sporting event. The options related to specific games such as football, hockey or boxing are not supported by the given information. The choice "side with opponent" is contradictory to a referee's role and doesn't make sense in the context. Answer is
sporting event

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a small ball is being bounced by someone or something, and one of the options refers to a "child's hand," which is a common place for a child to hold and bounce a small ball. The other options do not seem to have a clear connection to the context of the sentence, as a soccer game involves a larger ball, the street and sidewalk may refer to bouncing a ball, but not specifically a small one, and a toy store is not a likely place for a ball to be bounced. Answer is
child's hand

Large cities are typically designed to have a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial areas, in order to support the needs of a large population.

large city

Answer is
backache

Knowledge: The use of a flashlight by a policeman in the street typically indicates that they are trying to direct traffic.

farmers market
Question: What is often an outward expression of happiness? Options: A: love,B: laughter,C: spread,D: tears,E: limp,. Knowledge: The word "outward" suggests that the answer is related to something that can be seen or heard. "Happiness" is also a clue that the answer is related to a positive emotion. Laughter is a common expression of joy and happiness, and is often easily recognizable and audible. "Love" and "tears" could also be outward expressions of happiness, but they are not as commonly associated with happiness as laughter. "Spread" and "limp" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
laughter

Knowledge: When people are constantly buying products, it means that there is a high demand for the manufacturer's goods, which can lead to an economic boom.

The other options do not accurately reflect the positive impact that a high demand can have on a manufacturing company. Answer is
economic boom

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a grant was used to fund the renovation, but it does not mention any specific organization or entity. However, the fact that a fountain was the centerpiece of the renovation and it was located in a public place implies that it was likely funded by a local government or municipality, such as a city government. The other options, such as a state, a casino, or Rome, are less likely to be the correct answer as they do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
city
Question: Why would someone be likely to avoid kissing? Options: A: arousal,B: shortness of breath,C: herpes,D: strong feelings,E: confusion,. Knowledge: Herpes is a sexually transmitted infection that can be spread through kissing, which is why someone may avoid it if they are worried about getting infected or if they have an active outbreak of herpes. Arousal and strong feelings may actually make someone more likely to want to kiss, while confusion is not likely to be a factor in this context. Shortness of breath could potentially be a reason someone avoids kissing, but it is not as directly related to the spread of herpes as the infection itself. Answer is
herpes
Question: What can judging something wrong lead to? Options: A: eat cake,B: responsibility,C: resentment,D: controversy,E: go to jail,. Knowledge: The question asks about the potential consequences of judging something wrong, and controversy is a logical answer as it suggests that disagreements and debates may arise from differing opinions on what is right or wrong. Eating cake and going to jail are not relevant responses to the question, and while responsibility and resentment may be potential consequences of judging something wrong, they do not capture the full range of possible outcomes as effectively as controversy. Answer is
controversy

Question: What would you do to numbers that are positive integers to get a result that is orders of magnitude larger? Options: A: written down,B: divided,C: added up,D: multiplied,E: get headache,. Knowledge: When you multiply a positive integer by another positive integer, the resulting number will be orders of magnitude larger than the original number. This is because each additional digit increases the magnitude of the number by a factor of 10. The other options do not involve any mathematical operations that would increase the magnitude of a number, and are therefore less likely to be the correct answer. Answer is
multiplied

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the girl's feelings towards the boy were evident in her behavior. One common way that people physically show interest or attraction towards someone is by smiling, which is likely why the sentence states that she had a constant smile. The other options (make eye contact, listening, compliment, another person) do not necessarily indicate interest or attraction towards the boy, and therefore are not the correct answer. Answer is
smile
Question: The cut was deep, the doctor had to use stitches in doing what the sides? Options: A: joining,B: put together,C: paste,D: heal,E: paste,. Knowledge: The word "stitches" suggests that the doctor was sewing something together, which would be the sides of the cut in this case. "Joining" and "putting together" both have a similar meaning to sewing or stitching. "Paste" could refer to a topical treatment, but it does not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Heal" is the ultimate result of the doctor's actions, but it does not describe what the doctor actually did. Answer is
joining
Question: Every person would get along in a what? Options: A: eat well,B: live comfortably,C: perfect world,D: fruit bowl,E: own house,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that in a perfect world, every person would get along.

perfect world
Question: What is a common cause of injury? Options: A: accident,B: theatre,C: doctor's office,D: hockey game,E: living thing,.

Accidents are a common cause of injury because they can happen in many different situations, such as car crashes, falls, and sports injuries. The other options do not have the same association with injuries. Answer is
accident
Question: If you keep telling many people about being a vegetarian what do you risk becoming? Options: A: annoyance,B: accomplish,C: intoxicated,D: emotional distress,E: notoriety,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if someone keeps talking to multiple people about their vegetarianism, there might be negative consequences.

annoyance
Question: James imported ugly cabinets because they were cheap.  They wouldn't be seen so it didn't matter what they looked like.  Where might they be installed? Options: A: kitchen,B: planes,C: mexico,D: bathroom,E: pantry,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cabinets were imported because they were cheap, and that they wouldn't be seen, which implies that they were meant for a storage space rather than a visible area like a kitchen or bathroom. A pantry is a place where people store food and other household items, and it is not a high-traffic area of the house, so it makes sense that someone might choose to install cheaper and less attractive cabinets there. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, either because they are visible areas (kitchen and bathroom) or because they do not make sense in the context (planes and Mexico). Answer is
pantry
Question: The comedian made a dull joke about a bald eagle and it ending up that way because of what treatment? Options: A: new york,B: canada,C: chemotherapy,D: rocky mountains,E: british columbia,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the joke made by the comedian was related to bald eagles and a specific treatment that may have caused them to become bald. Chemotherapy is a medical treatment commonly associated with hair loss, which may explain why it was mentioned in the same sentence as the joke about bald eagles. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
chemotherapy
Question: Where would you put your car keys if you want to go driving? Options: A: ignition switch,B: pocket,C: purse,D: home,E: trunk,. Knowledge: The ignition switch is where the car key is inserted to start the engine and begin driving. The other options, such as pocket, purse, and home, are not relevant to the context of the question and would not be where one would typically place car keys when preparing to drive. The trunk is also an incorrect option as keys are not typically stored in the trunk of a car for driving purposes. Answer is
ignition switch
Question: It is a lovely day, let's go outside and skate instead of doing what? Options: A: really,B: put on helmet,C: sing,D: not work so hard,E: falling down,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that going outside to skate is a better alternative to doing something else. The other answer choices, such as putting on a helmet or singing, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Falling down" is also not a logical alternative to doing something else, but a potential consequence of skating. Therefore, the correct answer must be "not work so hard," as it is the only opposing option that suggests a different activity that is more enjoyable than working. Answer is
not work so hard
Question: He worked hard to have great success at his chosen what? Options: A: new job,B: vocation,C: awards ceremony,D: schedule,E: michigan,. Knowledge: The use of the phrase "chosen what" indicates that the correct answer will be a career or profession that someone actively pursues or chooses for themselves. The use of the word "success" suggests that this career or profession may involve achieving certain goals, milestones, or accomplishments. Out of the given choices, only "vocation" fits this criteria, as it refers to a person's life/career calling or purpose. The other choices are either too specific (new job, awards ceremony) or unrelated (schedule, Michigan) to the context of the sentence. Answer is
vocation
Question: The cover was a hindrance to the diners, so what did they do with it? Options: A: underneath,B: opening,C: divert suspicion,D: leave open,E: landcover,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the cover was causing some sort of problem or inconvenience for the diners, so they decided to do something about it. The most logical option would be to leave it open or remove it entirely. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "underneath" and "opening" are not actions that can be taken with a cover, "divert suspicion" is irrelevant and doesn't make sense, and "landcover" is not a common term associated with covers in this context. Answer is
leave open
Question: In any city you usually see a high rise where? Options: A: residential area,B: san francisco,C: downtown,D: suburbs,E: detroit,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the high rise is located in a central and busy part of a city. The option "downtown" is the most likely answer, as it refers to the commercial and business hub of a city where high-rise buildings are commonly found. The other options are either too specific (e.g., San Francisco, Detroit) or not relevant to the context of a high-rise building. Answer is
downtown
Question: If a lot of cargo trucks come and go every day, where would the forklift get the most use? Options: A: loading dock,B: construction site,C: construction yard,D: warehouse,E: cargo,. Knowledge: The context suggests that the forklift would be used in a place where cargo trucks come and go frequently, which is usually at the loading dock of a warehouse or a distribution center. A loading dock is a designated area where goods are loaded and unloaded from trucks, so it is where the forklift would be most useful. The other options such as construction sites or yards may also use forklifts, but they are not as likely to have a high volume of cargo trucks coming and going. Answer is
loading dock
Question: The route passenger was flipping through a magazine, he was bored waiting for his ride where? Options: A: shop,B: work,C: rack,D: bus depot,E: newsstand,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the passenger is waiting for a ride, which points to the bus depot as the correct answer. A bus depot is a place where buses stop to let passengers on and off, and it is common for people to wait there for their transportation. The other options (shop, work, rack, and newsstand) do not typically involve waiting for a ride, and therefore do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
bus depot
Question: What is often the result of having lunch too fast? Options: A: spending money,B: sickness,C: heartburn,D: low blood sugar,E: obesity,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence associated with eating lunch too quickly. Heartburn is a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can be caused by eating too quickly and not chewing food properly. Sickness, low blood sugar, and obesity are not necessarily associated with eating too quickly, and spending money would not be a direct consequence of eating too quickly. Answer is
heartburn
Question: If the weather means you what, so do your animals? Options: A: travel,B: get cold,C: feel pain,D: move,E: electrical circuit,. Knowledge: The phrase "If the weather means you..." implies that the weather has a certain effect on the subject being discussed, and the answer choice "get cold" makes logical sense in this context. Animals are often affected by changes in temperature, and if the weather is cold, it makes sense that the animals would also get cold. The other options are not necessarily related to weather or animals. Answer is
get cold
Question: WHere does someone sit in a chair to gossip? Options: A: desk,B: friend's house,C: auditorium,D: synagogue,E: ocean,. Knowledge: The word "gossip" implies a casual and social setting where people are talking about personal matters. Sitting at a desk or in an auditorium does not fit this context. A synagogue is a religious place and not necessarily a place for gossip. The ocean is unrelated to the context of the question. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a friend's house, which is a common place for casual conversations and gossip. Answer is
friend's house
Question: She filled the thing with water and went to plug it in, she had finally finished her garden with what centerpiece? Options: A: stream,B: perfume,C: sink,D: fountain,E: swamp,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker filled something with water and plugged it in, which indicates that it is an electronic device. The use of the word "centerpiece" suggests that it is a decorative object that holds a prominent place in the garden. A fountain fits these criteria as it is a water feature that is often used as a decorative centerpiece in gardens. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they are not commonly associated with gardens or decorative centerpieces. Answer is
fountain
Question: Where would you find a single air conditioner? Options: A: house,B: in a bike,C: car,D: hard,E: texas,. Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer must be a location or object where a single air conditioner could be found. Therefore, options such as "house", "hard", and "Texas" are not specific enough to provide a clear answer. Additionally, the option "in a bike" is unlikely since bicycles generally do not have air conditioning units. Therefore, the best option is a car, as it is a common location for a single air conditioner unit in order to keep the passengers cool while driving. Answer is
car
Question: If you're hearing sounds what product the uses a laser are you using? Options: A: physics lab,B: laboratory,C: bomb,D: hospital,E: cd players,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the product mentioned uses a laser to produce sound. CD players use lasers to read the data stored on a disc and convert it into audio.

Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the music was very dear to the person, which suggests that they were involved in its creation. The phrase "during an important time in his life" implies that the person had a significant personal connection to the music, which further supports the idea that they were the composer. The options of night club and stolen do not fit with the context of the sentence and dreamt and written on paper do not provide enough information to support a correct answer. Answer is
composed
Question: Dancing or walking too much will lead to what on your feet? Options: A: humiliation,B: fatigue,C: skin,D: blisters,E: exhaustion,. Knowledge: The question suggests that the activity of dancing or walking can cause a physical problem on the feet. Fatigue and exhaustion are related to muscle tiredness and overall exhaustion, while humiliation is related to social embarrassment rather than a physical symptom. Skin is too broad of a term, and not specific enough to indicate a foot problem. Blisters, however, are a common problem that can occur on the feet from too much friction or pressure, making them the most likely correct answer. Answer is
blisters
Question: If you know how to read and write you are what? Options: A: smart,B: literate,C: have paper,D: not give up,E: creativity,. Knowledge: Literacy refers to the ability to read and write, which is the context of the sentence. While being literate may be associated with intelligence or having access to education (which could be connected with being smart or having paper), the most direct connection to the sentence is that literacy is the ability to read and write. The other options may not be incorrect, but they are not the most precise match for the question. Answer is
literate
Question: What would you experience if a friend robs you after cashing in chips at a casino? Options: A: betrayal,B: resentment,C: depressed,D: leave,E: profit,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a friend has taken advantage of you by stealing after cashing in chips at a casino. This would likely lead to feelings of betrayal, as you had trusted your friend but they violated that trust. Resentment and depression are also possible emotional responses, but betrayal is the most likely fit based on the context. "Leave" and "profit" are not relevant options, as they do not reflect the negative impact of being robbed by a friend. Answer is
betrayal

mouth
Question: The weasel would go round and round the what while waiting to attack? Options: A: apple tree,B: rabbit warren,C: chicken coop,D: mulberry bush,E: viking ship,.

Out of the options given, only the mulberry bush is commonly associated with the children's rhyme "Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush," which includes the phrase "the monkey chased the weasel." The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Question: Billy was a solider.  He joined the military because he wanted to do what? Options: A: to marry,B: fight for freedom,C: report for duty,D: wait for orders,E: receive orders,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Billy joined the military for a specific reason. The phrase "fight for freedom" is commonly associated with military service, as soldiers often go to war to protect their country's freedoms and liberties. The other options do not make sense in this context. For example, getting married is not typically a reason to join the military, and waiting for orders is something that soldiers do after they have already joined. Answer is
fight for freedom
Question: What might cause someone to have a last passing sentence? Options: A: bounding,B: death,C: grief,D: judgement,E: appeals,. Knowledge: The phrase "last passing sentence" suggests an end to someone's life. The word "passing" is often used as a euphemism for death, while "last" implies that this sentence is final, indicating that the person has died.

The other options are all antonyms of massive and do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
dwarf
Question: Where can you find a single musician that an audience is listening to? Options: A: studio,B: stage,C: band,D: symphony,E: orchestra,. Knowledge: The word "audience" suggests that the musician is performing in front of a group of people, and the phrase "single musician" suggests that they are performing alone rather than as part of a larger group. The most likely place for this to happen is on a stage, where a performer can stand alone and be the focus of attention for the audience. The other options, such as a studio or orchestra, may involve multiple musicians working together or may not involve a live audience. Answer is
stage
Question: What do you miss out on if you stay in and read book all day? Options: A: learning,B: education,C: experience,D: knowledge,E: learn to read,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if someone stays in and reads a book all day, they are missing out on something. Since reading a book is a solitary activity, it's likely that the thing they are missing out on is some sort of social or interactive experience. The other options such as learning, education, knowledge, or learning to read are not necessarily mutually exclusive with reading books and therefore don't explain what someone would miss out on if they specifically stay in and read all day. Answer is
experience
Question: Where might someone find an abundance of cloth? Options: A: egyptian tombs,B: fabric store,C: kitchen,D: washing machine,E: bedroom,. Knowledge: A fabric store is a place that commonly sells cloth. This is in contrast to the other options, which do not typically have cloth readily available. Egyptian tombs may have preserved clothing made of cloth, but it would not be readily available for purchase or use. The kitchen and bedroom may have items made of cloth, but they are not places where cloth is typically stored or sold. The washing machine is used to clean clothes made of cloth, but it is not a place where cloth is found in abundance. Answer is
fabric store
Question: The man finished mowing his lawn and enjoyed a glass of lemonade on his porch, he took a sip and told himself that life was what? Options: A: good,B: ending soon,C: fleeting,D: finite,E: important,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man had finished a chore (mowing his lawn) and was therefore taking a break to enjoy a refreshing beverage on his porch. The fact that he tells himself something after taking a sip of lemonade indicates that he is taking a moment to reflect on his life. The word "good" is a positive descriptor that conveys a sense of contentment and satisfaction with his life at that moment. The other options ("ending soon," "fleeting," "finite," "important") do not fit the context of the sentence as they suggest a more negative or uncertain outlook on life. Answer is
good
Question: The trim made a good line between the floor and the what? Options: A: obesity,B: desk,C: sky,D: wall,E: ceiling,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the trim is separating two surfaces and the options that could be separated by a line would be a wall and a floor. The other options, such as obesity or sky, do not correlate with the context of the sentence. Similarly, a desk does not necessarily require a trim to divide it from the floor, and the ceiling is usually separated from the floor by a wall rather than a trim. Answer is
wall
Question: Where would you fire a projectile ball at a clown's mouth? Options: A: flintlock,B: tennis court,C: at home,D: motion,E: arcade,. Knowledge: The question implies that firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth is a game that can be played. This game is typically found in arcades as a carnival or circus themed attraction. The other options do not provide any context related to the game's setting, so they are unlikely to be correct answers. Answer is
arcade
Question: The guy was going to bed instead of going to work, what does he suffer from? Options: A: money,B: making love,C: laziness,D: dreaming of,E: falling asleep,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the guy is choosing to go to bed instead of going to work, indicating a lack of motivation or productivity. This could be explained by laziness, as the other options do not fit the context of the sentence. "Money" and "making love" do not seem relevant, while "dreaming of" and "falling asleep" suggest unconscious actions rather than a conscious decision to skip work. Answer is
laziness
Question: What low area between mountains can an apple tree be typically found? Options: A: valley,B: washington state,C: open,D: countryside,E: fields,. Knowledge: Apple trees are commonly associated with growing in valley regions, where the climate is cool and mild with moderate rainfall.

valley
Question: Playing piano and other creative activities need what? Options: A: make music,B: inspiration,C: musical sounds,D: making music,E: dancing,. Knowledge: The sentence is talking about creative activities, specifically playing the piano. Inspiration is often a key component in any artistic endeavor, and playing the piano is no exception. While making music and creating musical sounds are important aspects of playing the piano, the sentence is asking for a broader term that encompasses all creative activities. Dancing is not related to playing the piano at all, and "make music" and "making music" are essentially the same answer with different phrasing. Answer is
inspiration
Question: What happens after committing murder? Options: A: distress,B: kill,C: problems,D: go to jail,E: fear,. Knowledge: Committing murder is a serious crime that typically results in the perpetrator being sentenced to jail time.

Answer is
go to jail
Question: What is the path of the earth around the sun called? Options: A: fotograph,B: orbit,C: tree,D: solar system,E: attraction,. Knowledge: The question is asking for the specific term used to describe the path of the earth around the sun. "Orbit" is the correct answer because it refers specifically to the elliptical path that a celestial body takes around a larger body, such as the earth's path around the sun. "Fotograph," "tree," "solar system," and "attraction" are not related to the earth's motion around the sun, and therefore are not the correct answer. Answer is
orbit
Question: Where would you put a vase on your wall? Options: A: cabinet,B: windowsill,C: table,D: fall off shelf,E: shelf,. Knowledge: The question asks about where to put a vase on the wall, which suggests that the vase needs to be elevated and supported. A cabinet or table would not be on the wall, and a windowsill may not be sturdy enough to hold a vase. "Fall off shelf" is not a suitable option. "Shelf" is the most appropriate choice as it provides a surface to hold the vase and is mounted on the wall. Answer is
shelf
Question: What are humans doing when they have offspring? Options: A: regret,B: drive cars,C: hear sounds,D: make mistakes,E: reproduce,. Knowledge: Reproduction is the biological process by which organisms create descendants.

The other choices (regret, drive cars, hear sounds, make mistakes) do not relate to the biological process of reproduction. Answer is
reproduce
Question: The robber wanted to conceal his pistol, where did he put it? Options: A: police station,B: war,C: police officer's belt,D: river,E: pants,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the robber wanted to hide his pistol, which is something that could easily be done by placing it in a location that is not visible to others. The option "police station" is unlikely because it's a place where guns are kept secure, whereas the robber wants to keep his gun hidden. "War" is also an unlikely option as it doesn't have any clear connection to the sentence. "Police officer's belt" might be a possible answer, but the sentence doesn't provide any context to suggest that the robber was near a police officer or had access to their belt. "River" is also unlikely as it would be an inconvenient and ineffective place to hide a gun. Answer is
pants
Question: Where in a house would a table be most likely placed? Options: A: living room,B: kitchen,C: dining room,D: conference,E: demonstration,. Knowledge: A table is commonly used for dining and therefore would most likely be placed in a dining room. While a table could be found in other areas such as a living room or kitchen, those spaces are not primarily used for dining purposes. The options "conference" and "demonstration" are not typically associated with a household setting and are unlikely choices. Answer is
dining room
Question: The person was always using mouthwash, why were they doing that? Options: A: headache,B: to quench thirst,C: white teeth,D: source of income,E: fair trial,.

white teeth
Question: What type of person wants to get in shape? Options: A: look attractive,B: overweight,C: sex,D: bowel movements,E: feel good,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the desire to get in shape is motivated by a need to address a physical condition - being overweight. While there may be other reasons why someone wants to get in shape, such as wanting to look attractive or feel good, the statement specifically references a physical condition. The other options - sex and bowel movements - are unrelated to the topic of getting in shape. Answer is
overweight
Question: What vehicle uses a tow chain? Options: A: motorbike,B: jewelry store,C: tow truck,D: trailer,E: gear shift,. Knowledge: The use of a tow chain implies that the vehicle is capable of towing something behind it, which rules out options like motorbike and jewelry store. The term "trailer" also suggests a vehicle that is designed for towing, but it is not explicitly stated that a tow chain is used with a trailer. Gear shift does not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Therefore, tow truck is the most likely answer. Answer is
tow truck
Question: What's black and white and contains many a story? Options: A: past,B: book or magazine,C: novel,D: newspaper,E: story book,. Knowledge: The phrase "contains many a story" suggests that the answer is a publication that regularly features multiple stories. While books, magazines, and novels can contain multiple stories, they are typically not black and white. Story books may be black and white, but they are not typically associated with containing multiple stories on a regular basis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is newspaper, which is traditionally black and white and contains a variety of news stories. Answer is
newspaper
Question: Several other people were standing around James.  They were jumping up and down, screaming loudly, and banging their heads.  Where might James have been? Options: A: water,B: in class,C: meeting,D: mall,E: concert,. Knowledge: The actions described in the sentence (jumping up and down, screaming loudly, banging their heads) suggest a high-energy and exciting environment, which is commonly associated with concerts. The other options do not fit this context - "water" is too vague, "in class" and "meeting" are unlikely to involve such behavior, and the "mall" is an unusual place for people to act this way. Answer is
concert
Question: Where does water enter in a dam to create electricity? Options: A: wet clothes,B: power turbine,C: cracks,D: thin soup,E: dribble,. Knowledge: Dams are typically built across rivers or other bodies of water to create a large reservoir that can be used to generate electricity. Water enters the dam through an intake valve or gate and flows into a penstock, which is a large pipe that carries the water to the power turbine. The force of the water in the penstock turns the blades of the turbine, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity. Wet clothes, cracks, thin soup, and dribble are not related to the process of generating electricity in a dam. Answer is
power turbine
Question: During battle he felt great anger, this drove him to do what? Options: A: drive car,B: destroy enemy,C: punch,D: release energy,E: write letter,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question was involved in a battle and felt a strong emotion that influenced their actions. Anger is commonly associated with aggression and a desire to harm others, which may explain why the person was driven to destroy their enemy. The other options do not make sense in the context of a battle where anger is present. Answer is
destroy enemy
Question: What is one likely trying to find an answer for when something is broken? Options: A: question,B: wrong,C: problem,D: swear,E: confusion,. Knowledge: When something is broken, it is typically not working as it should, indicating that there is a problem.

Question: Billy liked seeing new teachers at school.   He enjoyed meeting new people, but didn't care about the quality of his what? Options: A: excitement,B: university of chicago,C: fear,D: envy,E: education,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy likes seeing new teachers because he enjoys meeting new people. However, it also implies that Billy doesn't care about the quality of his education, as this is not mentioned in the sentence. The other options, such as excitement or envy, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The option "University of Chicago" is not relevant to the sentence, since it is not mentioned whether Billy attends or aspires to attend this institution. Answer is
education
Question: What can you do to a door but not to a jar? Options: A: found at shower,B: opened,C: found up store,D: closed,E: locked,. Knowledge: This question is asking for a verb that can only be applied to a door and not to a jar. The answer is "locked" because you can lock a door using a key, padlock, or other devices, but you can't lock a jar as it typically does not have a locking mechanism. The other options, such as "closed" or "opened," are applicable to both doors and jars. Answer is
locked
Question: Billy was a student taking a course in communications.  Where might he be taking his classes? Options: A: every aspect of life,B: library,C: in a movie hall,D: classroom,E: university,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Billy is a student taking a course, which implies that he is enrolled in an educational institution.

university

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is frustrated with driving to work, specifically with traffic. The use of the word "chore" implies that it is something she does not enjoy, and the mention of traffic hints at a potential cause of her frustration. The word "impatience" fits into this context as it is a common feeling associated with waiting in traffic. The other options do not make sense in this context or are not closely related to the situation described in the sentence. Answer is
impatience

Options: A: tired feet,B: pondering,C: gaining knowledge,D: exhilaration,E: wonder,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny spent all day at the museum looking at exhibits, indicating that he was on his feet for an extended period. Additionally, the sentence mentions that he studied the exhibits carefully, indicating that he was likely moving around and engaging with the exhibits. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that he might have gone home due to tiredness in his feet from standing and walking all day. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
tired feet
Question: Lance spotted a wet beaver in the river.  Where might have lance been? Options: A: dictionary,B: books,C: australia,D: seaside,E: countryside,.

Question: Where would a doctor rush to? Options: A: nursing home,B: sick patients,C: dentist,D: emergency room,E: golf course,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a doctor would "rush" somewhere, which implies that there is an urgent need for medical attention. The only choice that reflects an urgent medical situation is the emergency room. A nursing home typically has patients who require long-term care, and while a dentist may be necessary for some urgent dental situations, it is not likely that a doctor would rush to a dental office. The same applies to sick patients in general. The golf course is not related to any medical event. Answer is
emergency room
Question: What traditional shop would one find a razor in? Options: A: medicine cabinet,B: barber shop,C: bath room,D: grocery store,E: suitcase,.

The goal of grooming is often to enhance one's appearance by being neat, clean, and well-dressed. The options "tardiness" and "late" have no relevance to the context, while "bathe" is a basic hygiene practice and doesn't necessarily imply an effort to look more attractive. "Neatness" is a possibility, but "looking good" is a more direct and accurate answer given the context of attracting women. Answer is
looking good
Question: The clerk had a paper sign, where did he put it? Options: A: hallway,B: public place,C: toilet,D: shop window,E: store window,. Knowledge: The use of the word "clerk" implies that the sign was posted in a commercial setting, rather than a hallway or toilet. Additionally, the fact that the sign was made of paper suggests that it was not intended to be a permanent fixture, so it is likely that the clerk put it in a location with high visibility to draw attention to a sale or promotion. The options "public place" and "hallway" are too general to suggest a specific location, while "toilet" is unlikely for a promotional sign. Therefore, "store window" is the most logical choice.

store window

Question: What institution are you trying to dissolve if you're getting a divorce? Options: A: court,B: marriage,C: being married,D: two people,E: lawyer,.

The most likely option from the choices provided would be a magazine article, as these are often found in waiting rooms and cover a variety of topics that can be read quickly. The other options do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence, as a safe deposit box, hotel menu book, and library are not things that one typically finds in a doctor's office, and the word "book" is too general and could refer to anything. Answer is
magazine article

Knowledge: The sentence describes a common practice when eating a meal, which is to place a cup on a surface. The most likely surface for this action is a table, which is used for dining and typically has enough space to accommodate a cup. The other options do not make sense in this context - a dishwasher is used for cleaning dishes, a shelf is usually elevated and not a good surface for placing cups, a coaster is specifically designed for cups but may not always be available, and a closet is not a surface for placing cups at all. Answer is
table

Knowledge: Ironing clothes is a common practice to remove wrinkles and creases that may have formed during washing, drying, or storage. The heat and pressure from the iron help to smooth out the fabric and give it a crisp appearance. Sanitation is not a primary reason for using an iron, although ironing can help to kill bacteria and freshen up clothes. "Attractive appearance" and "looks good" are essentially the same as removing wrinkles. "Ruined" is the opposite of the intended result. Answer is

Applauding is a possible reaction to a speaker who is perceived as inspiring or motivating, so it makes sense that the students started to applaud. Laughing or taking notes would not necessarily be an unusual response, and falling asleep would not be a reaction to a professor becoming preachy. Learning is also not considered an unusual reaction to attending a lecture. Answer is
applaud
Question: Why would you be doing housework? Options: A: cleanliness,B: allergies,C: joy,D: exhaustion,E: boredom,.

Knowledge: A catwalk typically refers to a narrow elevated platform used for walking, which is commonly found in theaters or on airplanes for crew members. New York City is a possible location for a catwalk, but it is not specific enough to determine its likelihood.

Answer is
fieldhouse

Options: A: get arrested,B: fear,C: getting arrested,D: going to jail,E: fined,.

The options "exit ramp" and "repair shop" do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they relate to locations outside of the man's home. "Front yard" is a possibility, but "driveway" is a more specific and likely answer since it is a common area to leave a car parked outside of one's home. "Garage" could also be a possibility but the sentence implies that the car was not put away in the garage. Answer is
driveway

Making bread is a creative activity that involves tasting and experimenting with different flavors and ingredients.

Knowledge: Literature refers to written works that have artistic or intellectual value, including books, poems, plays, and essays. Newspapers may contain written works, but they are considered more of a source of news and information rather than literature. "Own home" and "good homes" do not make sense as options as they are not related to literature. A public library may contain literature, but it is not necessarily a type of literature itself.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is experiencing unexpected episodes of unconsciousness, which is a common symptom of a concussion. Additionally, the sentence states that he is also suffering from something else. The word "annoying" implies that whatever he is experiencing is more of an inconvenience than a serious medical issue.

"Networked" describes a type of computer connection, but it does not describe the situation of a computer not working. Answer is

A common place for this type of storage is an attic, which is typically a dry and insulated space located above the main living areas of a house. The other options are unlikely choices for storing old items, as a waste bin would not be suitable for preserving items or protecting them from dampness, a cellar may be too damp, a fridge is too small and not used for storage of non-food items, and a museum would not be accessible for personal use.

Therefore, her husband is likely to feel embarrassed by her actions, as they reflect on both her and him as a couple.

Knowledge: The question is asking about indoor activities that can be done during the winter, which suggests that the correct answer should involve something that can be done inside the house. Skiing, skating, and playing hockey are outdoor winter sports that require specific equipment and spaces, so they are unlikely to be done inside the house.

The park and town do not have any connection to public transportation, and are therefore unlikely options. Answer is
bus station

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lizard was trying to warm itself up, which means it would need to be in a warm location. The term "sunny place" implies a location that receives direct sunlight, which is a source of warmth.

The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence.

Laziness and getting pregnant are also not directly related to the act of going to bed. Rest could be a reason for someone to take a break or relax, but it is not necessarily a synonym for going to bed. Answer is
sleepiness

Knowledge: The question suggests that playing a board game with family is an activity typically done in a domestic setting, which is why the correct answer is "house." The other options do not fit the context of the question. A "toy store" and "shelf" are not places where one would typically play a board game, and a "mall" is a public space that is not typically associated with playing games. "Cupboard" is also not a suitable option, as it refers to a storage space, rather than a location for an activity. Answer is

The option "england" fits this context as red telephone boxes are commonly associated with England, particularly in rural areas. The other options, such as a restaurant or doctor, do not provide any context that would suggest the presence of a red telephone box. The option "city on street corner" may be a possible location for a phone box, but it contradicts the information that the sentence is set in the countryside. Answer is
england

Knowing what time also does not relate to confidence. Answer is
trust himself

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spending too much time contemplating something can lead to a negative outcome, specifically a type of pain. The options "relaxation" and "deciding" do not fit with this negative connotation, and "regret" also doesn't make sense as a result of merely contemplating something.

The remaining option, "headache," is a well-known effect of prolonged mental strain or excessive thinking, making it the correct option. Answer is
headache

The location of Minnesota is not relevant to the context of the question. Answer is
office building

Knowledge: A medicine cabinet or medicine chest is typically where people store personal hygiene products such as deodorant, as well as other health and beauty items like toothbrushes, razors, and medications. The other options, such as using a spray or keeping it in the shower, do not make as much sense because they may decrease the shelf-life or effectiveness of the product. Keeping deodorant in one's own bathroom is plausible, but the most commonly associated storage location is the medicine cabinet or medicine chest. Answer is

The option "express emotion" is the only one that aligns with this idea. The other options do not match the context of the sentence, for example, "quiet mind" and "beautiful" do not relate to creating music to share emotions.

express emotion

Answer is
edible

The question also suggests that the change will be used soon, which means it needs to be easily accessible.

purse

The word "eloquent" suggests that James has a way with words, while "muttering" implies that he was struggling to articulate his thoughts.

Question: What might I use to grow a ficus on my patio? Options: A: tropical forest,B: arboretum,C: soil,D: pots,E: large pot,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is looking for a way to grow a ficus on their patio. The options "tropical forest" and "arboretum" refer to natural environments and do not provide any guidance on how to grow a plant in a specific location. "Soil" is important for growing plants, but it is not a suitable answer for this question because the speaker is looking for a container to grow the ficus in. "Large pot" is a more specific answer than "pots" and may be correct in some cases, but the size of the pot depends on the size of the plant and the space available on the patio. Therefore, the best answer is "pots," which suggests that the speaker should consider using multiple containers to grow the ficus on their patio. Answer is
pots

Therefore, the answer must be a location where a diaphragm would not be found if there is no one to insert it. A drugstore sells various forms of birth control, so it is not a viable option. The other options are all related to the human body, which is where a diaphragm would be found. Answer is
drugstore

Knowledge: The sentence makes it clear that the company was concerned about profit, which suggests they were looking to cut something that was costing them money. Expenses are costs associated with running a business, so it makes sense that they would be the target of the cost-cutting measures.

Where might the rosebush been located? Options: A: neighbor's yard,B: in the ground,C: field,D: nature,E: botanic garden,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Joe crossed a property boundary, which implies that he left his own property and entered someone else's. If he ran into a rosebush, it is likely that the bush was located in the neighbor's yard, which is a common place to find plants and landscaping. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
neighbor's yard

Question: What divider is often between two buildings that cars drive on? Options: A: fork in road,B: sidewalk,C: living room,D: street,E: binder,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a physical divider between two buildings that cars drive on. Sidewalks are typically located next to buildings and are not meant for cars, while a fork in the road would generally lead to different directions rather than dividing two buildings. A living room and binder are completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is street. Answer is
street

god's creation
Question: Billy is an animal, but he is alergic to trees. He hates them very much.  Still, he wants to have a picnic and can't stand the idea of buying food from a restaurant.  Where would he have his picnic? Options: A: addidas,B: north america,C: cafe,D: outside,E: woodland,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy wants to have a picnic outside because he doesn't want to buy food from a restaurant. The option "addidas" is a brand of clothing and not related to the context of the sentence. "North America" is a continent and not a location suitable for a picnic. "Cafe" implies buying food from a restaurant, which Billy doesn't want to do. "Woodland" would not be a suitable location for Billy because he is allergic to trees and hates them. Therefore, the correct answer is "outside." Answer is
outside
Question: Driving to work late is never pleasant, but you still shouldn't what? Options: A: listen to radio,B: sing,C: speed,D: anger,E: statue,.

Knowledge: Cruise ships are known for providing luxury experiences for their passengers, with extravagant dining areas being a common feature. The limited space on a ship also means that every area needs to be utilized to the fullest, with dining areas often taking up a significant portion of the ship's interior. In contrast, a home or restaurant may have limited space and resources for extravagant dining areas, while a mall or "coming together" are not typically associated with dining areas at all. Answer is
cruise ship

Knowledge: Birds are known for having wings, which they use to fly. The sentence mentions that birds do not have arms, which is a characteristic that distinguishes them from mammals. The other options either do not relate to the anatomy of birds or are redundant (such as "ability to fly," which is already implied by the mention of wings). Answer is
wings
Question: Why would a person go to school? Options: A: party,B: own house,C: more leisure time,D: successful in life,E: not feel pain,. Knowledge: Going to school is often associated with obtaining an education or training that can lead to greater opportunities and success in life. While some individuals may go to school for socializing purposes, such as partying, the primary motivation for attending school is to gain knowledge and skills that can help one achieve their personal and professional goals. The other options, such as owning a house, having more leisure time, or not feeling pain, are not relevant factors in the decision to attend school. Answer is
successful in life
Question: What does your body do when walking? Options: A: exercise,B: move,C: getting somewhere,D: moving forward,E: keep moving forward,. Knowledge: The verb "walking" implies movement, so the correct answer should also relate to movement. "Exercise" is too broad and does not specifically describe what the body does while walking. "Getting somewhere" and "moving forward" are both correct, but "move" is the most general and accurate answer that encompasses all types of walking. "Keep moving forward" implies a specific direction, which is not necessarily true for all walks. Answer is
move
Question: What could happen to a car when you press one of its pedals? Options: A: gain speed,B: go forward,C: rush away,D: go fast,E: suffer damage,. Knowledge: Pressing a pedal in a car typically controls some aspect of the car's movement. In this case, the options "go forward," "rush away," and "go fast" all generally mean the same thing as "gain speed," but are less specific. "Suffer damage" does not accurately describe the effect of pressing a pedal, and is therefore not a correct answer. Answer is
gain speed
Question: The man owned a lot of guns, he thought more gun control was what? Options: A: controlled in canada,B: a great idea,C: bad,D: semiautomatic,E: very dangerous,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man who owned a lot of guns did not agree with the idea of more gun control. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be an option that is the opposite of "a great idea" or "controlled in Canada," which suggests gun control is a positive thing. The option "semiautomatic" refers to a type of gun and is not related to the man's opinion. The option "very dangerous" also does not fit the sentence because it describes the guns, not the man's opinion. Answer is
bad
Question: John was an important person, but when wronged he could be what? Options: A: trivial,B: petty,C: slight,D: negligible,E: impoite,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John had an important role or position, but when he was wronged, he could exhibit a negative trait. The word "petty" means to focus on small or insignificant details, which suggests that John may become irrationally fixated on minor wrongs or grievances. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they do not describe negative traits that John might exhibit when wronged. Answer is
petty
Question: The park had a refuse and littering problem, so they added another what? Options: A: tip,B: park officer,C: incinerator,D: dump,E: wastebasket,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the park was facing a problem with people leaving trash and litter around, and that they took measures to address this issue. The most logical solution would be to add more garbage cans or wastebaskets to the park, which would make it easier for visitors to dispose of their trash properly. The other options, such as a tip or incinerator, do not make as much sense in the context of the sentence. A park officer could help enforce littering rules, but they would not directly address the problem of trash disposal. Answer is
wastebasket
Question: When someone talk, what does someone else usually do to the person talking? Options: A: don't interrupt,B: sit silently,C: keep silent,D: be silent,E: listening,. Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that the focus is on what someone else does when someone is talking to them. The verb "talk" refers to speaking out loud, and the other options all suggest being silent or not interrupting, which is not specific enough to address the question. "Listening" is the best answer as it directly correlates to the act of someone speaking and someone else paying attention to what they are saying. Answer is
listening
Question: What type of area would you be entering if dressed in a suit when putting your car in a parking lot? Options: A: urban area,B: amusement park,C: house,D: business district,E: shopping center,. Knowledge: The phrase "dressed in a suit" suggests a formal attire typically worn for business or professional settings. Therefore, the most likely option is a business district, which is an area with many office buildings and commercial activities. The other options do not necessarily require formal attire, and would not necessarily warrant wearing a suit to park your car. Answer is
business district
Question: What is a good place for a potato to mix with other veggies? Options: A: beef stew,B: restaurants,C: garden,D: steak house,E: cooking pot,. Knowledge: In many cultures, potatoes are a common ingredient in beef stew. The combination of potatoes and beef creates a hearty and filling meal, and the potatoes absorb the flavors of the other vegetables and spices in the stew. Restaurants, steak houses and gardens do not provide any specific context related to mixing potatoes with other veggies, while cooking pot is a generic term that does not suggest any particular dish or recipe. Answer is
beef stew
Question: What can you do before taking final exams to help with them? Options: A: study,B: sweat,C: graduation,D: cheat,E: sleep,. Knowledge: Final exams are typically associated with the need to prepare and review material beforehand. Studying is the most common way to do this, and is widely known as the most effective way to improve test results. Sweating is not likely to help with exams, and cheating is unethical and can lead to serious consequences. Graduation is a separate event that occurs after exams are taken, and sleeping may be helpful in some cases but is not a guaranteed way to improve exam performance. Answer is
study

standing

The other options do not necessarily suggest an emotional connection with the film or a high level of engagement. Answer is
interesting

Question: While eating a hamburger with friends, what are people trying to do? Options: A: have fun,B: indigestion,C: death,D: tasty,E: gas,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that people are eating a hamburger with friends, which typically implies a social activity. Eating with friends is often associated with having a good time and enjoying each other's company, which is why "having fun" is the correct answer. The other options, such as "indigestion," "death," "tasty," and "gas," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be correct. Answer is

Question: Why would someone visit many stores before buying products? Options: A: online shopping,B: running out of money,C: debt,D: comparison shopping,E: overstocking,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is visiting multiple stores with the intention of buying products. However, the reason for doing so is not immediately clear. Among the options provided, only comparison shopping would make sense in this context. Comparison shopping involves visiting multiple stores to compare prices, features, and quality of products in order to make an informed decision about what to buy. The other options (online shopping, running out of money, debt, overstocking) do not accurately reflect the situation described in the sentence. Answer is
comparison shopping
Question: What entity would have a fire extinguisher in their boardroom? Options: A: boat,B: apartment,C: public building,D: most businesses,E: chemistry lab,. Knowledge: Fire extinguishers are typically found in buildings and spaces where a fire could occur, and most businesses are required by law to have them on hand. Boat and apartment may have fire extinguishers on board/in units, but it is unlikely for them to have one in their boardrooms specifically. Public buildings may have them, but not all of them do, and it is less common for them to have one in a boardroom. A chemistry lab would likely have a fire extinguisher as well, but again, it is less likely to be in their boardroom specifically. Answer is
most businesses
Question: What is someone likely to do to someone accused of killing people they love? Options: A: go home,B: sadness,C: retaliation,D: remorse,E: going to jail,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone has been accused of killing people that another person loves, which suggests that the person who loves the victims may seek revenge or retaliation against the accused. Retaliation is a common reaction to betrayal or harm, especially if the person feels a strong emotional connection to the victims. "Go home", "sadness", "remorse", and "going to jail" are not logical choices for a person's reaction to someone accused of killing their loved ones. Answer is
retaliation
Question: A person doesn't have pants that fit, what should he do? Options: A: buy a monkey,B: let himself go,C: buy clothes,D: bank money,E: catch cold,.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that horses require a lot of energy to function properly due to their size and amount of exercise they get. As a result, they need to hydrate themselves properly by drinking water. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence as running quickly or pulling a wagon are forms of exercise that horses are already getting, going away is not a solution or a requirement, and eating carrots does not address the issue of hydration. Answer is
drink water
Question: Where would you find a sloth that is not afraid of being hunted? Options: A: forest canopy,B: nature preserve,C: zoo,D: tropical rainforest,E: commercial,. Knowledge: The question implies that sloths are commonly hunted, so the answer that makes sense is a location where hunting is prohibited or at least discouraged. A nature preserve is a protected area where animals can live without human interference, so it is the most likely option. A forest canopy and a tropical rainforest are both habitats where sloths live, but they do not provide protection from hunting. A zoo is a controlled environment where animals are kept in captivity, so it does not fit the description of a sloth that is not afraid of being hunted. "Commercial" is not a location where sloths would naturally live. Answer is
nature preserve
Question: What is the biggest group of people on the east coast where you will find skyscrapers? Options: A: new york city,B: big city,C: large city,D: metropolis,E: beach,.

Both "theater" and "stage show" are viable options, but "theater" is spelled differently in British English ("theatre"). "Photography studio" and "mini project" do not make sense in the context of building a backdrop for a performance. Answer is
stage show
Question: What is a convenient way for a farmer to preserve their crops? Options: A: can produce,B: harvestation,C: water plants,D: produce food,E: rise early,. Knowledge: Canning is a common method of preserving crops for long periods of time. It involves sealing food in an airtight container, like a can, and then heating the can to destroy any bacteria or microorganisms that might cause spoilage.

Answer is

The other options (sit down, would read, reading, remember) do not fit the context of the sentence as well. Answer is
write down
Question: The stove had to be moved so the kitchen could be remodeled, where did it go? Options: A: apartment,B: living room,C: boiling liquids like water,D: friend's house,E: restroom,. Knowledge: The sentence states that the stove had to be moved due to a kitchen remodel, which implies that the stove was temporarily relocated within the same living space. The most likely option from the given choices is the living room, as it is usually the largest open area in a home where a stove could be placed. The other options, such as apartment, friend's house, and restroom, do not fit the context of the sentence since they are not within the same living space. The option of boiling liquids like water is also unrelated since it does not provide a clear answer to where the stove was moved to. Answer is
living room

These events often have concession stands selling hot dogs and other snacks for attendees to enjoy while watching the game.

Options: A: emotional distress,B: bad feelings,C: richer,D: depression,E: guilty,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the husband received money (alimony) after the divorce.

richer
Question: WHere do you typically buy prescription suntan lotion? Options: A: beach bag,B: grocery store,C: pharmacy,D: shop,E: tanning salon,. Knowledge: Prescription suntan lotion is typically only available through a pharmacy, as it requires a prescription from a doctor. The other options, such as a grocery store or tanning salon, do not typically carry prescription medications. The beach bag and shop options are also unlikely, as they do not refer to a specific type of store or retailer. Answer is
pharmacy
Question: If you like your jeans already broken in where should you shop? Options: A: thrift store,B: clothing store,C: outside,D: closet,E: gap,. Knowledge: The phrase "broken in" suggests that the person wants jeans that have already been worn and have a more comfortable, relaxed fit. Thrift stores are known for selling secondhand clothing, including items that may have already been broken in by their previous owners. Clothing stores may sell new, stiff jeans that have not yet been worn in, and the options of outside and closet don't make sense in the context of the question. Gap is a specific clothing store, but it does not necessarily specialize in selling pre-worn or broken-in clothing. Answer is
thrift store

Question: Why would you be getting in shape? Options: A: good health,B: jogging,C: exercise,D: sweat,E: feel better,.

Regular exercise and physical activity are essential to maintaining good health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.

Question: What does someone committing suicide want to do? Options: A: cut wrist,B: swimming,C: dying,D: die,E: interruption,. Knowledge: Suicide is an intentional act of taking one's own life.

Question: When potatoes aren't raised in town where are they raised? Options: A: farm,B: cellar,C: restaurant,D: boiled,E: countryside,.

Cellars and restaurants are not locations where potatoes are raised, and boiling is a cooking method, not a location. Answer is
countryside

religion

Options: A: ancient history,B: recent,C: stone age,D: storybook,E: ancient times,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the mammoth is currently extinct, and cloning it would bring it back to life. The term "ancient history" refers to something that happened a long time ago, and since mammoths are extinct, they are considered to be a part of ancient history.

ancient history

Given this context, it is logical to assume that the mockingly displayed item is likely to be connected to the poison, such as an antidote to counteract the effects of the poison.

amusement park

public outrage
Question: The fingers do this with the hand. What is it? Options: A: sign language,B: scratch,C: articulate,D: cup water,E: soft,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity involving fingers and hands is related to movement or articulation. "Scratch," "cup water," and "soft" do not involve movement or articulation of the fingers in relation to the hand. "Sign language" is a possibility, but the sentence does not provide any other context or clues that suggest sign language would be the correct answer. Therefore, "articulate" is the best fit as it means to move the joints of the body, such as the fingers, in a precise and flexible way. Answer is
articulate
Question: Where is the best place to keep personal lettuce? Options: A: supermarket,B: farmer's market,C: pantry,D: refrigerator,E: salad,. Knowledge: Lettuce is a perishable vegetable that can wilt and spoil easily if not stored properly. The best place to store lettuce is in a refrigerator, which helps to keep it cool and crisp. The other options are not suitable for storing lettuce, as they do not provide the same level of temperature control and protection from moisture that a refrigerator does. The supermarket and farmer's market are places where lettuce is purchased, not stored.

Question: Where would the heifer go to join her herd? Options: A: slaughterhouse,B: cow palace,C: dairy farm,D: cow pasture,E: barnyard,. Knowledge: The word "herd" refers to a group of grazing animals, typically cows or other livestock. The options "slaughterhouse" and "dairy farm" suggest that the heifer will be used for meat or milk production, which is not mentioned in the question. "Cow palace" is not a typical term used to describe a place where cows graze or live. "Barnyard" could be a possibility, but it is a more general term that could refer to any area where livestock are kept, while "cow pasture" specifically refers to an open grazing area for cows. Answer is
cow pasture

Options: A: church,B: hockey game,C: movie theater,D: new york stadium,E: stadium,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that what the audience is watching is a form of entertainment. Out of the given choices, only a movie theater is typically associated with showing movies that contain scenes of battles, shooting, and explosions. The other options, such as a church or a hockey game, do not typically involve this type of content. While stadiums may host events that feature battles or explosions, the mention of "New York Stadium" in particular is unlikely to be relevant to the sentence. Answer is
movie theater
Question: When not playing your mandolin, where would you store it? Options: A: closet,B: musical instrument store,C: instrument case,D: music shop,E: music store,. Knowledge: The question implies that the mandolin needs to be stored somewhere when not in use. Among the options provided, closet is unlikely to be the correct answer since it does not provide proper protection for the instrument. Musical instrument store, music shop, and music store are not suitable answers as they are places where instruments are sold, not stored. The most logical answer is instrument case, as it is designed specifically for the purpose of storing and protecting musical instruments. Answer is
instrument case

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the audience is likely watching a sports game or activity where a ball is being used.

The other options do not typically have events that involve a ball being thrown or hit. Answer is

Question: If children are happy, what do they do? Options: A: enjoyed,B: skip,C: sleep,D: awesome,E: watch television,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that when children are happy, they engage in some kind of physical activity that indicates their joy, as opposed to passive activities like watching TV or sleeping. Skipping is a form of physical expression that is often associated with happiness and carefree behavior in children, hence it is the most appropriate option among the given choices. 'Enjoyed' is a past participle and cannot be used to describe actions in the present tense. 'Sleep' and 'watch television' are not indicative of children's happiness in this context, and 'awesome' is an adjective that does not describe an action. Answer is
skip
Question: If a phoneless person needs to make a call from a public phone, where might they find one? Options: A: office,B: desktop,C: neighbor's house,D: movie theater,E: rest area,. Knowledge: Public phones are typically found in places where people may need to make calls but do not have access to a personal phone, such as rest areas along highways.

rest area
Question: A quarter of it was twenty five pounds, so the whole was what? Options: A: school year,B: hundredweight,C: upper,D: century,E: hour,. Knowledge: A "quarter" typically refers to 25% of something, and in this sentence, it is specified that the quarter in question has a weight of 25 pounds. This suggests that the item being weighed is likely measured in pounds or something similar, which rules out choices like "school year," "upper," and "century." "Hour" is also not a likely answer, as it is a unit of time rather than weight. "Hundredweight," on the other hand, is a unit of weight that equals 100 pounds, and therefore fits with the information provided in the sentence. Answer is
hundredweight
Question: John didn't have to ride his bike.  He did it for only one reason. What reason is that? Options: A: thirst,B: enjoyment,C: for fun,D: pleasure,E: fatigue,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John did not have to ride his bike, but he still did it for a reason. The reason is likely to be something that is enjoyable or pleasurable to him, since he was not doing it out of necessity such as thirst or fatigue. The options "for fun" and "pleasure" are synonymous with enjoyment and fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
enjoyment
Question: The play was nearly starting, everybody took their seat in the what? Options: A: show,B: in cinema,C: theatre,D: bench,E: martorell,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the play was about to start, which is a clear indication that the setting is a theatrical performance. The choice "theatre" refers to a venue specifically designed for stage performances, which would be the most likely location for the play to take place. The other options, such as "show" or "in cinema," are too vague to accurately describe the setting implied by the sentence. "Bench" and "Martorell" are unlikely options as they don't directly relate to the context of the sentence. Answer is
theatre
Question: Where does a cast act? Options: A: perform,B: stage,C: cast net,D: film,E: broken leg,. Knowledge: In the context of theater or acting, a cast typically refers to the group of actors who perform on stage. The word "perform" is also commonly associated with acting and theater, further supporting the idea that the correct answer is "stage." The other options, such as "cast net" and "broken leg," are unrelated to acting or theater. "Film" might also be a valid answer, but it is less specific than "stage" and could refer to acting in movies or television shows as well. Answer is
stage
Question: Dancing poorly in public may make you feel what? Options: A: exhaustion,B: recognizance,C: blisters,D: humiliation,E: fatigue,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that dancing poorly in public can lead to a negative emotional experience. The word "humiliation" specifically denotes a feeling of shame or embarrassment, which would be appropriate in this context. The other options don't necessarily convey a negative emotional experience related to dancing poorly, such as exhaustion or fatigue (which are physical sensations) and blisters or recognizance (which don't necessarily indicate a negative emotional experience). Answer is
humiliation
Question: What is the object with a point used for mountain climbing? Options: A: hat,B: arrowhead,C: needle,D: alpenstock,E: waterpoint,. Knowledge: The sentence describes an object with a point that is used for mountain climbing. This eliminates choices such as hat, arrowhead, and needle, which are not associated with mountain climbing equipment. Waterpoint is also unlikely, as it does not have a point and is not used for climbing. Alpenstock, on the other hand, is a type of pole or stick used specifically for mountain climbing and is known for its pointed tip. Answer is
alpenstock
Question: THe apiarist bought a new queen, where was the queen bound? Options: A: england,B: beehive,C: farmyard,D: monarchy,E: deck of cards,. Knowledge: Apiarists are beekeepers, and the term "queen" refers to the female bee responsible for laying eggs and leading the hive. To introduce a new queen to a hive, the apiarist typically cages her or binds her wings to prevent her from leaving. The logical answer to the question, therefore, is "beehive." The other options, such as "England," "monarchy," or "deck of cards," have no apparent connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
beehive
Question: Where are there more than 1 trillion planets like earth? Options: A: god's creation,B: ball stopped,C: gravity,D: milky way,E: universe,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are more than 1 trillion planets that are similar to Earth. This is a statistical estimate that is difficult to confirm, but it suggests that the number of planets like Earth is very large. The other options do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. "God's creation" is a religious concept and not a scientific explanation for the existence of planets. "Ball stopped" and "gravity" are physical concepts that do not relate to the number of planets in the universe. The Milky Way is a galaxy, but the sentence suggests that there are more than 1 trillion planets like Earth in the entire universe, not just one galaxy. Answer is
universe
Question: John and George are camping together.  They're sitting around a pile of sticks and john is lighting a match.  Why is john lighting a match?

Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that John is attempting to start a fire, which is commonly done by using a match or other ignition source.

The other options do not provide any clues as to the monkey's behavior or emotions. Brazil and the rain forest are locations that monkeys are found, but they do not necessarily tell us about the specific behavior of the monkey in the sentence. Treetops and busy are also not directly related to the monkey's behavior or emotions. Answer is
playful mood
Question: What is likely to be a child's reaction to going to play? Options: A: happiness,B: tears,C: sit,D: being entertained,E: laugh,. Knowledge: Going to play is typically seen as a fun and enjoyable activity for children, which would lead to a positive emotional response such as happiness. Tears and sitting would suggest negative or indifferent emotions, while being entertained and laughter are more general emotions that can apply to a variety of situations and do not necessarily indicate a specific reaction to going to play. Answer is
happiness

Question: Where can you buy alcohol and items for nourishment? Options: A: lunch room,B: supermarket,C: chemistry lab,D: restaurants,E: pub,.

Question: Where is a flat likely to be grouped with other flats? Options: A: london,B: city,C: town,D: apartment building,E: condominium,. Knowledge: Flats are typically found in larger structures like apartment buildings, whereas options like London, City, and Town are too broad and do not appropriately capture the context of the question. Condominiums can also refer to individual units like flats, but they are not always grouped together in a larger building as frequently as flats are. Answer is
apartment building
Question: I only like fiction books, why should I read a non-fiction book? Options: A: knowledge,B: been printed new,C: many words,D: for fun,E: cover,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person only enjoys reading fiction books, but there may be a benefit to reading a non-fiction book. The answer "knowledge" is the most logical choice, as non-fiction books are often written to teach readers about a particular subject or provide information about real events. By reading a non-fiction book, the person could expand their knowledge and learn something new. The other options (been printed new, many words, for fun, cover) do not provide a compelling reason to read a non-fiction book. Answer is
knowledge
Question: Where would you be most likely to see a cow? Options: A: road,B: slaughter house,C: ranch,D: switzerland,E: tennessee,. Knowledge: Cows are typically raised on farms or ranches for their milk, meat, or as draft animals. Therefore, the correct answer would be "ranch."

Answer is
ranch

Offering a price is a common action that a real estate agent could take in order to negotiate a deal with the seller of a house. Misrepresenting, covering up, deceiving, or leaving town are all unethical or illegal actions that a real estate agent should not engage in. These options do not align with the responsibilities of a real estate agent. Answer is
offer price

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person did not like the previous mattress because it was too rigid or hard, so they are likely seeking a mattress that is softer and more comfortable. Out of the choices given, ductility, malleability, and flexibility all refer to a object's ability to bend or change shape, which is not directly related to comfort. Empity is not a word, and therefore cannot be the answer. Answer is
softness
Question: What is it called when a reproduction of an original movie is made? Options: A: reproduction,B: junior,C: copy,D: derivative,E: remake,. Knowledge: The question refers to creating a new version of an existing movie, which is commonly known as a remake.

Question: An over-heated snake will hide where in a house? Options: A: bedroom,B: tropical forest,C: oklahoma,D: basement,E: river,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that an over-heated snake will seek shelter in a house, and the correct answer is likely a location in a house that is cooler than other areas.

A temperate climate is typically characterized by moderate temperatures, with neither extreme heat nor extreme cold, which can be ideal for humans and many other animals to live in.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a hard substance can take on different forms, which implies that it is something that can be manipulated or molded in different ways. The option "formed into cubes" best fits this description, as it suggests a solid substance that can be shaped into different forms. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Ice cream" is not a hard substance and "chipped" and "found in Arctic" do not necessarily imply different forms. Answer is
formed into cubes

Hamburger is a relatively high protein food, so this aligns with the sentence. "Crack" and "cook one" are not related to the context of the sentence and "good to eat" and "satisfy hunger" are too general and do not provide a clear answer. Answer is
protein
Question: Where could you find a steel cable that has not been completed yet? Options: A: winch,B: factory,C: roller coaster,D: ship,E: building,.

A factory is the most likely place to find a steel cable that has not been completed yet because it is where steel cables are typically produced. The other options – winch, roller coaster, ship, and building – are not logical places to find an incomplete steel cable, as they are not typically associated with the production of steel cables. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person being referred to has moved to a different state, which implies a significant physical distance from the speaker. "Far" is the most appropriate word to describe this type of distance. "There" refers to the location where the person has moved and does not inherently imply a specific distance. "Nearby" implies close proximity, which contradicts the idea of the person being far away. "In sight" and "being here" imply that the person is still nearby and visible, which again contradicts the idea of them being far away. Answer is
far

A theatre is a venue specifically designed to showcase live performances such as plays, musicals, and concerts.

A movie theater and ballpark are also not associated with live stage performances. Answer is

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
opera house

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a song has the ability to emotionally affect the listener, and this effect is achieved through one of the five senses. The phrase "touch your heart" implies that the effect is emotional, rather than physical. The options "smelling" and "sniff" are related to the sense of smell, which is not commonly associated with music. "Seeing" and "sight" refer to the sense of sight, which is not directly related to the experience of listening to music. Therefore, "hearing" is the most appropriate answer, as it is the sense directly related to the experience of listening to music. Answer is
hearing

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was sitting quietly and not doing something easily because the speaker was having trouble with something. The options discomfort, anxiety, and solitude may suggest that James was either feeling uncomfortable, worried, or alone. However, the option of falling asleep does not fit with the context of the sentence as it suggests that James was feeling tired and sleepy, which is not relevant to the situation described. The option of playing games also does not fit with the context as it is not mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is he was not falling asleep easily. Answer is

Question: Birds sometimes do what to each other to establish dominance? Options: A: sky,B: mate,C: hatch,D: forest,E: peck,.

The use of the word "morbid" reinforces this idea, as mortuaries deal with death and are often associated with negativity.

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
mortuary

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the real estate person had a negative impact on people, and that in order to improve, she needs to learn a new skill. The options of deceive, manipulate, and lie, all suggest unethical behavior, which would not be a desirable trait in someone in real estate. The option of train is too vague, and doesn't provide any information on what specific skill she would need to learn. Therefore, the most appropriate choice would be charming, as this suggests that she needs to improve her interpersonal skills in order to better relate to clients and improve her sales tactics.

The other options, such as "pride" and "gratification," suggest a more personal feeling of satisfaction rather than a communal celebration. "Gamble" is not applicable to the context, and "feeling of accomplishment" is too general and does not provide a specific action. Answer is
celebrate

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John's company is involved in selling products but doesn't have anything to do with manufacturing them. In this context, "ship goods" is the most logical choice because it implies that the company is responsible for transporting the products to their customers. The other options do not make sense in this context, as they have no clear connection to the sale of products. "Commit crime" is an obviously incorrect option, while "own resources" and "stock shelves" imply manufacturing or physical ownership of products, and "mail order" doesn't clarify how the products are delivered to customers.

Options: A: learning,B: competitiveness,C: losing,D: winning,E: relaxation,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the games were played with a purpose beyond mere entertainment or enjoyment.

Answer is
high walls
Question: What would cause someone to have to re illustrate point? Options: A: teacher,B: did not understand,C: agree with,D: understanding,E: understood,. Knowledge: The use of "re-illustrate" suggests that someone had already attempted to explain a point but it was insufficient.

Question: Two friends lived in different countries, how did they frequently communicate? Options: A: wedding,B: fraternity house,C: internet cafe,D: smoke signals,E: movie,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the two friends were able to communicate despite their distance, which suggests the use of a communication tool that works remotely. The options "wedding," "fraternity house," and "movie" do not fit the context of two friends communicating from different countries.

Therefore, "internet cafe" is the most logical option as it is a place where one can use the internet to communicate with people remotely. Answer is
internet cafe

Knowledge: A patio is typically an outdoor space that is made of hard, durable materials such as concrete or stone. It is likely that the surface of a patio would be best cleaned by sweeping away dirt and debris with a broom, rather than using a mop or toothbrush, which would be better suited for cleaning a softer or more delicate surface. Vacuuming may also be effective, but it may not be as efficient as sweeping, particularly if the surface is rough or uneven. Mobility is unrelated to cleaning the patio. Answer is
broom

The most likely option is the human body since it is the most relevant in a medical context. The brainstem is a part of the nervous system that is located in the brain, but the context suggests that the scan is more comprehensive. The skeleton is a part of the human body, but it is not a primary focus for a nerve-related scan. Organism and animal are very broad terms that do not provide any specific information related to the context of the sentence. Answer is
human body
Question: What areas does a cat tend to seek out? Options: A: the place i don't want it,B: relaxed position,C: soft place,D: barn,E: urban settlement,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat is looking for a particular type of location. Cats are known for seeking out soft, comfortable places to rest, which is likely why "soft place" is a viable option in the choices. "The place I don't want it" and "barn" are unlikely options because they suggest locations that may not be conducive to a cat's comfort or safety. "Relaxed position" is a trait or behavior, not a location. "Urban settlement" is too general and does not provide any useful information about where a cat may seek out. Answer is
soft place
Question: Something that people do when they are sneezing a lot and have a runny nose? Options: A: inhale,B: blow nose,C: close eyes,D: cover face,E: spray,.

Blowing one's nose is a common action people take to clear out excess mucus and relieve congestion during these times. While inhaling and covering the face are also actions people may take when sneezing, they do not directly address the issue of a runny nose. Closing one's eyes is simply a reflexive response to the forceful expulsion of air during a sneeze. Spray could refer to a nasal spray, but this choice is less commonly associated with the act of sneezing and having a runny nose. Answer is
blow nose

While laughter and pleasure can also indicate fun, they may not always manifest in a visible facial expression. Being happy is a more general emotion and does not necessarily indicate specifically having fun. Showing teeth could be a sign of aggression or a forced smile, and may not necessarily indicate having fun either. Answer is

Question: Where does a potato enlarge? Options: A: garden patch,B: ireland,C: vegetable stew,D: grocery store,E: optical device,.

An optical device is not relevant to the growth of a potato. Answer is

The words "tangible" and "corporeal" indicate that he had only experienced things that could be touched or felt, while the other choices suggest non-physical or abstract concepts.

The other options, such as "insubstantial" or "ethereal," do not necessarily connote a spiritual awakening. Answer is
spiritual

This means that their demands, which caused the strike in the first place, must have been met by the management. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. If the company had closed, the union workers would not have gone off strike. If the management had given more money, the union workers would have been happy and not gone on strike in the first place.

The correct answer is "closed container" because once opened, glue can dry out or harden if left exposed to air. This is why it's important to keep glue tightly sealed when not in use. The other options, such as "art room" or "desk drawer," don't necessarily provide the necessary conditions for preserving the glue's usability. "Sticky" is not a location and "cabinet" gives no indication of whether the container is open or closed, so these options can be eliminated. Answer is
closed container

Jams can occur if debris or moisture gets into the gun's action, causing it to malfunction. Guns can break if they are not properly maintained, but it is not a common occurrence when they get wet. "Take life" is not a potential effect on the gun itself but instead an outcome of the gun being fired. Answer is
misfire
Question: If you're going to buy a house for your family you're about to do what? Options: A: make money,B: closet space,C: settle down,D: lose money,E: pay for,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that buying a house is a significant step towards establishing a permanent home for one's family, which is often associated with the idea of "settling down." "Make money" and "lose money" are not related to the context of buying a house for the family, while "closet space" and "pay for" are possible considerations when buying a house but do not capture the overall purpose of the decision. Answer is
settle down
Question: A product that has been out of stock but is now restocked is what? Options: A: plenty,B: empty,C: abundant,D: plentiful,E: available,. Knowledge: The phrase "out of stock" implies that the product was not available for purchase. Therefore, if the product has been restocked, it is now available once again. The other choices, such as "plenty," "empty," and "abundant," do not suggest that the product is available for purchase again. "Plentiful" and "plenty" suggest that there is a large amount of something, but not necessarily that it is available for purchase. "Empty" implies that there is nothing left or available, and "abundant" suggests that there is a lot of something, but not necessarily that it is available for purchase. Answer is
available
Question: What sets escalators apart from stairs? Options: A: motion,B: eat cake,C: department store,D: mall,E: bringing people up,.

This can be frustrating and disruptive, leading to feelings of anger or despair. As such, the choice "hell" is a likely option for a computer user's perspective on a computer crash. The other options (own home, school, work, house) do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
hell
Question: Sam was an alcoholic.  He was in a car crash two years ago and was injured.  Where might he have crashed? Options: A: bridge,B: park,C: bar,D: prison,E: neighbor's house,. Knowledge: The fact that Sam was an alcoholic and was injured in a car crash suggests that the crash was likely related to his drinking. Bridges are often associated with drinking and driving accidents, as they are typically located on busy roads or highways and can be more difficult to navigate when impaired. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
bridge
Question: Unlike Mars and all its dust, what is full of all sorts of features from soil and rock to water and grass? Options: A: surface of earth,B: library,C: potato,D: most buildings,E: desktop,. Knowledge: The sentence contrasts Mars with something that has a variety of features, which suggests that the correct answer must also have a diverse range of components. The surface of Earth contains a variety of materials, such as soil, rocks, water, and vegetation, which makes it the most appropriate choice. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they either do not have diverse features (e.g. potato and desktop), or are unrelated to the topic (e.g. library and most buildings). Answer is
surface of earth
Question: In the modern days we give what kind of classification to buildings to protect them from being town down? Options: A: classical,B: old fashioned,C: vintage,D: historical,E: antique,.

This classification is intended to protect buildings that are significant in history, which implies that the correct answer must have something to do with history.

historical

The other options are less likely to be associated with sloths or their preferred habitats. Answer is
tropical rainforest
Question: What can I find that is about 4.5% alcohol? Options: A: beer,B: wine,C: pub,D: uncle joe,E: fraternity house,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the answer is a type of alcoholic beverage. Beer is commonly known to have an alcohol content of around 4.5%, while wine can range from 5-15% depending on the type. A pub is a place where alcoholic drinks are served, but it is not a specific type of drink. Uncle Joe and fraternity house are not relevant options in this context. Answer is

Question: The heater broke down before the city's Christmas party, so they could no longer host the party in the what? Options: A: automobile,B: public building,C: house,D: home,E: train,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions a city's Christmas party, which suggests a larger gathering that likely wouldn't be held in someone's home or automobile.

Answer is
public building
Question: Where can I get a drink? Options: A: bar,B: china,C: a brothel,D: theater,E: space shuttle,. Knowledge: When someone is looking for a drink, they are typically referring to an alcoholic beverage such as beer, wine or a cocktail, which are commonly served in bars.

A space shuttle does not serve drinks to its passengers. Answer is
bar
Question: What the final step for a farmer after making things grow? Options: A: flowering,B: harvesting,C: planting,D: blooms,E: growth,. Knowledge: After a farmer has made things grow, the next step is usually to harvest the crops. Harvesting refers to the process of gathering mature crops from the fields and preparing them for sale or consumption. The other options may be related to the process of growing crops, but they are not the final step that a farmer would take. Flowering and blooms are stages of plant growth, planting is the initial step, and growth is a general term that could refer to any stage of the process. Answer is
harvesting
Question: After chewing food and swallowing it during meals, what needs to happen for you to be able to successfully use the bathroom later? Options: A: good digestion,B: aid digestion,C: eating,D: sore mouth,E: toothache,. Knowledge: Digestion is the process by which our body breaks down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed into our bloodstream and used for energy, growth, and repair. Good digestion is essential for the body to properly absorb nutrients and eliminate waste. Eating is the process of putting food in our mouth, and sore mouth and toothache are conditions that may affect the ability to chew and swallow food, but they do not affect the process of digestion itself. Aid digestion may refer to medications or supplements that assist the digestive process, but the sentence is not referring to these interventions. Answer is
good digestion

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Ben doesn't have much respect for Sue and would act in a way that is contrary to her wishes. "Disregard" means to ignore or pay no attention to, which fits the context of the sentence. "Throw away" and "humiliate" do not fit the context and seem too extreme. "Being rude" is not specific enough and could apply to a variety of actions. "Abhor" means to hate or detest, which doesn't make sense in this context. Answer is
disregard
Question: When he couldn't hear the sickness in her voice over the phone anymore he told the object of his love you what? Options: A: appear,B: sound well,C: become broken,D: belong to person,E: gain speed,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person on the phone was sick and the speaker could no longer hear the sickness in their voice. Therefore, it is likely that the speaker said something positive or reassuring, such as "sound well." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
sound well
Question: Where should you keep a pet lizard? Options: A: desert,B: garden,C: galapagos archipelago,D: wild,E: glass cage,. Knowledge: A pet lizard should be kept in a glass cage or tank, as it provides a secure and controlled environment that allows for temperature regulation and protection from predators. The other options are either unsuitable habitats for most pet lizards (such as the desert or wild) or are not relevant to the context of the question (such as the Galapagos Archipelago or garden). Answer is
glass cage
Question: Billy was a kooky person, but he wasn't gay.  What was he? Options: A: mainstream,B: conventional,C: straight,D: standard,E: ordinary,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy's characteristic of being "kooky" has no relation to his sexual orientation, specifically not being gay. The word "straight" is commonly used to refer to someone who is heterosexual, so it is the best option that accurately describes Billy's sexual orientation based on the given sentence. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Question: When people are playing sports for to long what happens? Options: A: running,B: cheat,C: have fun,D: break out in purple polka dots,E: get tired,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a negative consequence that occurs when people play sports for too long. Since the other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, we can eliminate them. Running and cheating are both actions that could potentially happen during sports, but they are not necessarily related to the negative consequence mentioned in the sentence. Having fun is generally considered a positive outcome of playing sports, so it is also not a likely answer. Finally, breaking out in purple polka dots is an absurd option that is clearly meant to be humorous, but it does not provide any useful information for choosing the correct answer. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is getting tired, which is a common consequence of physical activity. Answer is
get tired
Question: A monkey is native to what place that usually has no people? Options: A: research laboratory,B: south africa,C: rain forest,D: playful mood,E: canada,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the animal being referred to is a monkey and that it is native to a place without people. Given this information, it is most likely that the monkey is found in a natural habitat rather than a research laboratory. The options "south africa" and "Canada" are geographic locations, but they do not provide any information on where monkeys can be found. "Playful mood" is not a place, and is not relevant to the question. "Rain forest" is a type of natural habitat, which is commonly associated with primates such as monkeys. Therefore, "rain forest" is the most appropriate answer. Answer is
rain forest
Question: John didn't like getting in line.  He  had been working for a long time and was suffering from what? Options: A: agitation,B: fatigue,C: common sense,D: have to wait for,E: rain,.

Knowledge: The act of raising one's hand in a classroom setting typically indicates the desire to answer a question or provide a comment. The other options, such as completing a test, reading a book, or studying a book, do not involve raising one's hand in the same way that answering a question does. "Died" is clearly not a valid option as no one would raise their hand in response to someone dying. Answer is
answer question
Question: Where do you keep computer speakers? Options: A: produce sounds,B: roof,C: conference,D: desktop,E: concert,. Knowledge: Computer speakers are typically kept on the desktop, which is the surface on which the computer monitor and other hardware sits. This is because the speakers are designed to produce sound for the computer, so they need to be in close proximity to the user. The other options do not make sense in the context of where computer speakers would be kept. Answer is
desktop
Question: If you're about to reach a stop sign in your car what must you do? Options: A: slow down,B: go fast,C: roll over,D: crash,E: fly,.

The option "cemetary" is the most likely answer as it is a common location for burial of bodies, including murder victims. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
cemetary
Question: where do some monkeys tend to live taht is hot? Options: A: rain forest,B: tree tops,C: treetops,D: great outdoors,E: tropical areas,. Knowledge: The word "hot" suggests that the monkeys prefer a warm climate. "Tropical areas" are known for having warm and humid weather, making it a suitable habitat for many monkey species. "Rain forest" may also be a suitable habitat for monkeys, but the choice of the word "hot" makes "tropical areas" a more likely answer. "Tree tops" and "treetops" are not habitats themselves, but rather a location within a habitat, and "great outdoors" is too broad of a term. Answer is
tropical areas
Question: Other than school or from text where can one gain knowledge? Options: A: book,B: class,C: thinking,D: head,E: meeting,. Knowledge: While books and classes are common sources of knowledge, the question asks for sources other than school or text. Meetings are a source of knowledge because they provide an opportunity for individuals to share their experiences and expertise with others. Meetings can also serve as a forum to discuss new ideas and learn from others. "Thinking" and "head" are not sources of knowledge, but rather describe a potential internal process. Answer is

fight enemy

Knowledge: The question is asking about a common activity that people in a family do during holidays. Gathering together is a common tradition among families during holidays, where they come together to celebrate and spend time with each other. Getting angry or facing each other do not necessarily relate to holiday traditions, while running a race is a specific activity that not all families may do. Talking to each other may occur during holiday gatherings, but it is not unique to holiday traditions. Answer is

The word "connected" also implies that there is some sort of passageway or hallway that links these rooms together. The word "bunkrooms" suggests that the cabin may be used for lodging or sleeping arrangements, further supporting the idea that it is made up of multiple smaller rooms.

Knowledge: When people are competing, the main goal is usually to win. However, it is also possible to lose or be defeated. This outcome is often associated with feelings of disappointment, sadness, and frustration. The other options, such as enemies and humiliation, are not necessarily outcomes of competition in general and may not be directly related to the context of the sentence. Aggression and stress are potential effects of competition but are not necessarily outcomes in and of themselves. Answer is

new look

Options: A: retail store,B: refrigerator,C: supermarket,D: car trunk,E: storage cabinet,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests the bachelor stored the groceries in a place where they could be forgotten, which suggests a place in the home where he wouldn't see them often. The choice 'storage cabinet' makes the most sense, as it's a place where people commonly store non-perishables, such as canned goods and dried foods. The other options, like 'refrigerator' and 'car trunk', wouldn't make sense since the former is a place for perishables and the latter is an inconvenient place to store goods for everyday use.

"Throw up" is a common side effect of many illnesses and may be a sign of an underlying condition that needs to be addressed. "Get better" is unlikely to be the correct answer, as the sentence implies that the person is not getting better without treatment. "Train" and "battle cancer" are not relevant to the context of the sentence, and "take medicine" is the opposite of what is being suggested in the sentence- that the person is not receiving any treatment. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence mentions winter and traveling up a mountain, which suggests that the person has a sport or activity that he enjoys during the winter season.

Question: When their engagement has ended what do soldiers get to do? Options: A: use weapons,B: follow orders,C: die in battle,D: hope,E: coming home,. Knowledge: The use of the phrase "when their engagement has ended" implies that the soldiers in question were engaged in some sort of military conflict. The choices "use weapons" and "follow orders" are both common activities for soldiers during a conflict, but do not necessarily relate to the end of their engagement. "Die in battle" is a grim option but does not address what happens when the soldiers' engagement has ended. "Hope" is too vague to be a correct answer. "Coming home" is the most logical choice as it suggests that the soldiers will be returning home once their engagement has ended. Answer is
coming home
Question: The advertisement appeared outside of a central Wisconsin town, where was it located? Options: A: web page,B: la ville,C: magazine,D: email,E: fargo,.

Jewelry stores specialize in selling all types of jewelry, including pieces made of precious metals like gold.

jewelry store
Question: What is the responsibility of many an adult? Options: A: drink beer,B: drive train,C: sweeping the floor,D: work,E: marry,.

Knowledge: Board games are often stored on shelves or in cupboards as they are typically flat and can be easily stacked or stored in a compact manner.

shelf
Question: What do you do to learn new things for a test? Options: A: television,B: study,C: go to school,D: ask questions,E: fun,. Knowledge: The question is asking for a method to learn new material for a test. "Study" is the most relevant choice because it specifically refers to reviewing material in order to learn and remember it. The other choices, such as watching television or having fun, do not necessarily contribute to the process of learning new material. Going to school can be helpful, but it is not specific enough to be the best answer. Finally, while asking questions can be a useful study technique, it is not always applicable or necessary depending on the subject matter. Answer is
study
Question: Mary was in motion the whole time.  From per perspective, it looked like everyone else was what? Options: A: stopped,B: stillness,C: standing still,D: static,E: being still,. Knowledge: The key phrase in the sentence is "Mary was in motion the whole time," which suggests that everyone else was not moving as much as Mary. The word "standing" also implies a lack of movement, so "standing still" is the most appropriate choice. The other options ("stopped," "stillness," "static," "being still") are either redundant or do not convey the sense of relative movement that is implied in the sentence. Answer is
standing still
Question: The fox was caught by animal control, where was it released? Options: A: english hunt,B: burrow,C: woods,D: mountains,E: rural area,. Knowledge: The fact that the fox was caught by animal control implies that it was removed from an urban or suburban area, where it may have been causing problems or could be in danger. The options "english hunt," "burrow," and "woods" all suggest confined spaces where the fox would not have been released, while "mountains" may not be a suitable habitat for the animal. "Rural area" is a more general and appropriate option that could be suitable for the release of a wild animal into its natural environment. Answer is
rural area
Question: How much water would there be if there was not a little amount of water? Options: A: bog,B: big,C: rain,D: lot of,E: large,. Knowledge: The question is asking about the amount of water, and suggests that there is currently only a small amount of water present. The phrase "not a little amount" implies that there is actually a significant amount of water, so the correct answer would be an option that indicates a large quantity. "Big" and "large" both suggest a substantial size or amount, but "lot of" specifically refers to a large quantity of something, making it the most appropriate choice. "Bog" and "rain" do not necessarily indicate a large amount of water, so they can be eliminated as options. Answer is
lot of
Question: Where do you get petrol? Options: A: burn hot,B: fuel tank,C: burn hot,D: car,E: gas station,. Knowledge: "Petrol" is a term commonly used in British English to refer to gasoline or fuel for vehicles. In this context, the most likely place to get petrol would be a gas station, as that is where vehicles typically go to refuel. The other options, such as "burn hot" and "fuel tank," are not locations where petrol can be obtained. "Car" is also not a suitable option as it is a vehicle that requires petrol to run, not a place to obtain it. Answer is
gas station
Question: If one sees a fox and is standing in a coastal, eastern seaboard state, where is this person? Options: A: mountains,B: arkansas,C: louisiana,D: california,E: south carolina,.

working out
Question: Where can you see a mountain in your own home? Options: A: park,B: switzerland,C: pennsylvania,D: picture,E: canada,. Knowledge: The question implies that the answer can be found in the context of one's own home, which rules out options like park or Switzerland which are physical locations. The word "see" suggests that the answer may have to do with visual perception, and "mountain" is a physical object. Therefore, the option "picture" is the most likely answer, as one can see a mountain in a picture or photograph displayed in their home. The other options again do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
picture
Question: What is a sport that involves hurdles? Options: A: get tired,B: winning,C: have fun,D: hoping,E: running,.

running
Question: What is a clever way to say someone isn't very good at what they do? Options: A: clumsy,B: dull,C: stupid,D: dummy,E: ineffectual,. Knowledge: The word "clever" suggests that the answer is not straightforward or obvious. "Clumsy" implies physical awkwardness rather than lack of skill, "dull" implies boring rather than bad, "stupid" and "dummy" imply a lack of intelligence rather than lack of skill. "Ineffectual," on the other hand, suggests that someone is not getting the job done or achieving their goals, which could imply a lack of skill. Answer is
ineffectual

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe learned some exercises to help him relax from his therapist, and that these exercises all had a common focus. The phrase "centered around" implies that there was a central theme or action that the exercises all revolved around.

The other options do not have a strong connection to relaxation or the context of the sentence. Answer is
deep breathing

The other options may not be necessarily related to the context of being confronted with something unexpected. Anxiety may be a possible response, but not all people react this way. Dedication, solutions, and acknowledgment do not necessarily apply to the situation of being confronted with something unexpected. Answer is
surprised

The other options, such as "very heavy" or "very dense" describe physical properties of lead, but do not address its effects on human health. Answer is
toxic
Question: James was in shock.  What he just learned was not what? Options: A: important,B: calm,C: thundershock,D: surprised,E: expected,.

Question: When I go to Spain, what should I try to practice first? Options: A: stand upright,B: courtesy,C: further education,D: speak spanish,E: cross street,. Knowledge: The question is asking for advice on what to practice when going to Spain. Since Spain is a Spanish-speaking country, it makes sense to prioritize practicing speaking the language.

Answer is

Question: What would happen if you are sleeping well? Options: A: sweat,B: nightmares,C: dreams,D: have fun,E: relaxation,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that sleeping well has a positive effect on the body and mind. One of the primary benefits of sleeping well is relaxation, as the body is able to rest and rejuvenate during the sleep cycle. Sweating and nightmares are not necessarily indicative of good sleep, and while dreaming can occur during sleep, it is not the primary result of sleeping well. "Have fun" is also an unlikely outcome of a good night's sleep. Answer is
relaxation
Question: The teen was required to go to school, which made him a what? Options: A: student,B: register,C: old enough,D: put on shoes,E: grouchy,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person mentioned is required to attend school, which is a common characteristic of someone who is a student. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Register" might be a possible answer if the sentence had mentioned the teen needing to register for classes, but that is not the case here. "Old enough" and "put on shoes" are also not relevant to the sentence. "Grouchy" is a possible descriptor of the teen's mood, but it does not answer the question of what the teen is. Answer is
student

Knowledge: People often compete in sports in order to achieve a sense of accomplishment, whether it be personal or within a team. Winning can bring a sense of pride and satisfaction, and the feeling of achieving something difficult can be motivating. Injuries are a risk associated with sports, but they are not usually a reason people choose to compete. Enemies and rivalry may be present in some sports, but they are not the primary motivation for most athletes. Death is not a motivation for sports, as it is not an expected outcome of competition. Answer is
accomplishment

The other options do not align with the positive connotation of the sentence. Answer is
pleasure

Question: Where would you put your foot if it is already covered in cloth? Options: A: desk,B: shoe,C: ground,D: sock,E: table,. Knowledge: Since the question mentions that the foot is already covered in cloth, it suggests that the person is wearing some kind of footwear. Out of the options provided, only "shoe" is a type of footwear. It is common to put a cloth-covered foot into a shoe rather than on the ground, desk or table. "Sock" is also a type of footwear, but it is worn underneath a shoe, so it is not the correct answer. Answer is
shoe
Question: He truly was a marathon runner, even after running twenty six miles he wasn't even beginning to what? Options: A: vomit,B: getting tired,C: excruciating pain,D: tiredness,E: death,. Knowledge: The statement suggests that the person being described is a successful marathon runner, which requires a great deal of physical endurance and stamina. Therefore, after running for such a long distance, it's natural to assume that the person might experience some physical discomfort. However, the use of the phrase "wasn't even beginning to" implies that the person is still feeling relatively good, and not yet facing any major physical symptoms. The other options, such as vomiting, excruciating pain, or death, all suggest much more severe consequences of running a marathon and are less likely to be seen as a natural part of the process. Answer is
getting tired
Question: She needed a diaphragm, she went to buy one where? Options: A: valve,B: drugstore,C: human,D: organ,E: person's chest,.

A diaphragm is a type of birth control that is inserted into the vagina, so none of the other options make sense in this context. A valve is a mechanical device used to regulate the flow of fluids or gases, while a human organ and a person's chest are not relevant to the conversation. Answer is

Question: One reason to keep going to work is what? Options: A: promotions,B: stress,C: bad mood,D: for a party,E: exhaustion,.

"Promotions" is the most logical choice, as it suggests that there is potential for career advancement and increased job responsibilities. "Stress," "bad mood," and "exhaustion" are all negative factors that could make someone want to quit their job, while "for a party" is an irrelevant and nonsensical option. Answer is
promotions

Entertainment venues such as nightclubs and concert halls may also offer bar service, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Hotel bars and train bars may be important amenities for travelers, but this is not necessarily related to celebrations. Pool parties often involve alcohol and socializing, but they are generally more casual and less formal than weddings. Answer is
wedding

Question: Why would someone light a fire? Options: A: to burn down a house,B: help people,C: warm hands,D: warm room,E: cleansing,. Knowledge: Lighting a fire is commonly done to generate heat and warmth, particularly in colder environments. This can help to make a room more comfortable and pleasant to be in, especially during the winter. The other choices do not necessarily have a clear link to the idea of intentionally lighting a fire. For example, burning down a house would be an act of arson rather than a practical reason for lighting a fire. Helping people or cleansing could potentially involve fire in some cultural or symbolic contexts, but these are less common or specific reasons than warming a room. Answer is
warm room
Question: Simon put crayon pictures on the wall of what? Options: A: classroom,B: labyrinth,C: zoo,D: art show,E: prison,. Knowledge: The sentence provides context clues that suggest that Simon placed drawings on a wall in a setting related to education.

classroom

Selling items is the purpose of the shop, not the reason for visiting it. Comparing prices may be a step in the purchasing process, but it is not the primary reason for visiting a shop. Answer is
purchasing

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a school is a necessary part of a community.

For example, playgrounds are important for communities, but not essential for their existence. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence refers to the aftermath of getting a divorce, which typically results in the dissolution of the marriage and the end of the relationship between the spouses. Therefore, the correct answer is "no spouse." The other options, such as "lot of grief" or "children suffer," may be common experiences associated with divorce, but they do not address the specific question of what happens to someone after the divorce is finalized. "Freedom" may be a possible choice, but it lacks the specificity and certainty of "no spouse."

Question: John saw a billboard every day on his way to work.  The billboard was visible from where? Options: A: texas,B: las vegas,C: street,D: football ground,E: countryside,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John saw a billboard every day on his way to work, indicating that the billboard was located somewhere along his route. Since the choices are all geographic locations, we can eliminate Texas, Las Vegas, and the countryside, as these options do not have a clear connection to a street. Similarly, a football ground would not typically have billboards visible from the street. Therefore, the correct answer must be street. Answer is
street

Meeting usually refers to a formal or informal gathering of people for a specific purpose, often with an agenda, and this could explain why John is joining others at the table. The other options like construction, kitchen, internet cafe, and building do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

"Family" and "marriage" are not directly related to responding to a disaster, while "let down" and "neglect" have negative connotations that do not fit with the idea of a support team providing help. Answer is
aid
Question: When one is looking at a series of attributes, how are they typically displayed? Options: A: on-screen,B: calculus,C: description,D: array,E: calculas,. Knowledge: The word "attributes" suggests that the question is referring to a list or set of characteristics or qualities. An "array" is a term commonly used to describe a systematic display of data or information, such as a table or matrix. On-screen is a possible display option, but it is not a universally applicable answer. The other options, calculus and calculas, are misspelled variations of the correct term. The term "description" is too vague and could refer to any number of ways to present information. Answer is
array
Question: What are you doing when you're climbing a mountain? Options: A: falling down,B: getting higher,C: vertigo,D: elevation,E: accomplishment,.

Accomplishment could be a result of climbing a mountain, but it is not a description of the activity itself. Answer is
getting higher

Options: A: national park,B: opera,C: yodel,D: confession,E: vehicles,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the politician is embarrassed and is expected to give a resignation speech. The press people are waiting for him, which indicates that there is likely a scandal or controversy surrounding the politician.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
confession
Question: What is another way to say someone is a failure? Options: A: insulted,B: hold back,C: illusion,D: lower expectations,E: amount to nothing,. Knowledge: The phrase "a failure" suggests that the person is not successful or achieving their goals. "Insulted" and "hold back" do not convey the same meaning and are not synonymous with failure. "Illusion" means something that is not real or true, which is not related to the context of the question. "Lower expectations" may be a consequence of being a failure, but it is not synonymous. "Amount to nothing" means to have no success or impact, which accurately describes someone who is a failure. Answer is
amount to nothing

spring into action
Question: Where do you keep your beer at home? Options: A: sporting event,B: bowling alley,C: bucket,D: fridge,E: bar,. Knowledge: The most common place to store perishable items like beer is in a refrigerator or fridge. We know that the beer is being kept at home, so options like sporting event or bowling alley do not make sense. A bucket may be used for holding ice and keeping drinks cool, but it's not typically where someone would store beer long-term. A bar could be a place where beer is served, but the question is asking about where someone would keep their own beer at home. Answer is
fridge

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the context is underwater exploration, specifically regarding a shipwreck. The use of the word "robotic" implies that machines have already been used to check out the shipwreck, which may indicate that a human is needed to provide additional information. A submarine is a vehicle specifically designed for underwater exploration and could potentially provide more information than any of the other options listed. The other options are not related to underwater exploration and have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
submarine

The goal of such communication is usually to share a message or to persuade others to take a specific action, which is consistent with the choice "speak out."

Question: The famous cornet was displayed so everybody could see it with other famous items where? Options: A: case,B: exhibition,C: marching band,D: high school band,E: museum,. Knowledge: The use of the word "displayed" suggests that the cornet was part of a collection that was open to the public for viewing. While all options may have been a possible location for the cornet, a museum would make the most sense because it is a place specifically designed for displaying artifacts and works of art for public viewing. The other options have no connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
museum

Knowledge: The word "committee" suggests a group of people who are working together on an ongoing basis, typically within a business or organization. The word "meeting" indicates that the group will be discussing something important, and the context suggests that they will be doing so in a professional setting. The options "church", "zoo", and "city hall" do not fit this description, and so can be eliminated. The option "office building" is more general than "boardroom", which specifically refers to a room in which a company's leadership would meet to make decisions and discuss important matters. Therefore, the most logical answer is "boardroom". Answer is
boardroom

The other options suggest reasons why someone may continue to have food, such as getting fat or being hungry, which do not fit the context of the sentence. Being full, on the other hand, is a common reason why someone may stop eating, as they may feel satisfied and no longer need to consume more food at that time. Answer is
being full

The option "believe in god" is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the sentence's context. Options such as "gain weight" and "own car" are irrelevant and have no connection to the sentence. "Thank God" and "experience joy" may be associated with religious beliefs but are not the most appropriate answers in this context, as the sentence does not suggest gratitude or pleasure. Answer is
believe in god

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the glass window was delicate and easily broken. The word "transparent" also implies that the glass was clear and easy to see through. The word "thin" further reinforces the idea that the glass was not strong or sturdy. "Soft" and "half empty" do not make sense in the context of describing a glass window, and "recyclable" is not relevant to the situation. Answer is
very fragile

Options: A: white house,B: school,C: friend's house,D: museum,E: apartment,. Knowledge: The sentence describes a personal space that is decorated with posters, suggesting that it is a place where someone can freely decorate to their liking. It is unlikely to be the White House or a museum, which are public spaces with specific decorum. A school or apartment may not allow for personal decorations in shared areas. Therefore, the most likely option is a friend's house where Suzie can decorate her personal space with posters of her favorite celebrities and interests. Answer is
friend's house
Question: Where would you expect to see a human eye? Options: A: faces,B: potato,C: person's head,D: mammal,E: skull,. Knowledge: The human eye is a feature commonly found on the face of a person, which is why "faces" and "person's head" are likely answers. "Potato" and "skull" do not have any connection to the context of the question and therefore can be eliminated as options. While "mammal" might be technically correct, it is too general and does not narrow down the answer enough. Answer is
person's head

Question: What lawn is most likely to be on a street? Options: A: green yard,B: suburbia,C: golf course,D: front yard,E: michigan,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the lawn being referred to is located on a street, which would make the front yard the most probable option. This is because front yards are typically located directly in front of a house and face the street, whereas green yards or suburbia could refer to any type of lawn in any location. A golf course is typically not found on a residential street, and Michigan is a state and not a type of lawn. Answer is
front yard
Question: What do many people do to a person on their birthday? Options: A: give gifts,B: receive letters,C: feel embarrassed,D: go to the club,E: thank god,.

Giving gifts is a common tradition for birthdays, whereas the other options do not have a clear connection to birthdays.

Feeling embarrassed, going to the club, and thanking God may occur on some birthdays but are not universal practices. Answer is
give gifts
Question: Both sides in World War I used what to cause death that is now banned? Options: A: homicide,B: poisonous gas,C: cyanide,D: nuclear weapons,E: massive weapons,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that during World War I, both sides used a method of causing death that has since been banned. This eliminates options such as nuclear weapons, which did not exist during World War I. Homicide is a general term for killing someone and doesn't specifically refer to the use of a weapon or method of causing death. Cyanide is a poisonous substance, but it was not used on a large scale during World War I as a weapon. "Massive weapons" is also a vague term and does not provide any specific information about what was used during the war. Thus, the correct answer is poisonous gas. Answer is
poisonous gas

Knowledge: White foxes, also known as arctic foxes, are commonly found in cold regions such as the arctic tundra.

arctic tundra

new computer
Question: Life goes different ways for different folks, sometimes good friends have to what? Options: A: comfort,B: keep secrets,C: leave,D: eat cake,E: part ways,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that life can take different paths for different people, and sometimes that means good friends need to separate or move in different directions. The phrase "part ways" often refers to the end of a friendship or relationship, indicating that this may be the correct answer. The other options (such as "comfort" or "eat cake") do not fit the context of the sentence and do not make logical sense in this context. Answer is
part ways
Question: I am hungry, what would be a way to alleviate this? Options: A: very much,B: have food,C: eat vegetables,D: eat quickly,E: make bread,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is in need of nourishment, so the most appropriate solution would be to have some food.

Eating vegetables or making bread may not readily provide an immediate solution to the need for food. Answer is
have food
Question: What effect did the TV have on the kids? Options: A: become adults,B: wonder about,C: open door,D: became healthy,E: distracting,. Knowledge: The word "effect" implies that the TV had a negative impact on the kids, and the word "distracting" suggests that it prevented the kids from focusing on more productive activities. To "become adults" is a natural process that cannot be attributed to the TV, while "wonder about" and "open door" do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Became healthy" is unlikely to be the correct answer as it is not related to the topic of the TV's impact on the kids. Answer is
distracting
Question: Billy was doing his homework at the last minute but he could barely think straight.   What might he have been suffering from? Options: A: sneezing,B: cleanliness,C: exhaustion,D: seizure,E: allergies,.

Sneezing and allergies don't necessarily cause difficulty thinking, while cleanliness is not related to this context at all. Seizures are a possibility, but there is no direct indication in the sentence that Billy was experiencing one. Answer is
exhaustion
Question: Where should watch to avoid being pinched by a crab? Options: A: eastern coast,B: sandy beach,C: fish market,D: north carolina,E: sand dunes,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions being pinched by a crab, which implies that the question is related to a beach or shoreline environment. The option "sandy beach" is the most likely correct answer because crabs are commonly found in coastal areas, and sandy beaches are a common type of beach environment where crabs may be present. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence or are not specific enough. Answer is
sandy beach

Options: A: mountains,B: dense areas,C: village,D: countryside,E: painting,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is trying to capture the beauty of the landscape, but he isn't good at it. This implies that James lacks skill in the specific area of capturing the beauty of landscapes. The phrase "he was never good at it" reinforces this idea. The other choices may be elements within the landscape, but they are not directly related to James' lack of skill in painting. Answer is
painting
Question: After washing clothes in what condition are they? Options: A: cold cloth,B: wet clothes,C: shrinkage,D: wear out,E: get wet,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that clothes have been washed. After washing, clothes typically come out wet and need to be hung up or put in a dryer to dry. The other options are not likely outcomes of washing clothes.

Answer is
wet clothes

Knowledge: Pavement is a hard surface material used to cover the ground in order to make it easier to walk, drive, or ride on. It is commonly found on roads, sidewalks, and other public spaces that are meant for vehicular or pedestrian traffic.

A race track may also have pavement, but it is not a common use for this material. Answer is

The best way to combat burnout in this scenario would be to engage in relaxation activities, such as meditation, yoga, or taking a warm bath. "Elapsed time" does not provide a solution to the problem, "exit" is not relevant to the context, "uneasiness" is the opposite of what is desired, and "getting there" is not applicable to resolving burnout from staying at home. Answer is
relaxation

Question: What do airplanes do? Options: A: carry freight,B: catch on fire,C: stall,D: in the clouds,E: accelerate,.

Memories are lasting and can be cherished for a lifetime, making them a logical answer choice.

Friendship bracelets, while a nice gesture, do not necessarily last a lifetime. Answer is
wonderful memories

Question: What happens to a sick person when he or she is not sick any more? Options: A: throw up,B: scuba dive in the bath,C: battle cancer,D: get better,E: take medicine,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the sick person is no longer sick, which is typically associated with getting better. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as they do not correspond with the idea of recovering from an illness. "Throw up" and "scuba dive in the bath" are unrelated actions, while "battle cancer" implies a more serious and ongoing illness, and "take medicine" refers to a treatment that may help the sick person get better, but not necessarily guarantee their recovery. Answer is
get better
Question: What is someone likely to call a bazaar in the US? Options: A: asia,B: india,C: festival,D: arabia,E: istanbul,. Knowledge: The word "bazaar" typically refers to a marketplace or street market in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries. While bazaars can be found in other parts of the world as well, they are not as common in the US. Therefore, the most likely option for what someone would call a bazaar in the US is "festival", which can refer to a variety of events that involve food, music, and vendors selling goods. The other options refer to specific regions or cities and do not have a direct connection to the concept of a bazaar. Answer is
festival
Question: He drank coffee every morning on his commute, he said it gave him energy for what? Options: A: play sports,B: obesity,C: work,D: wrestle,E: fatigue,. Knowledge: The sentence implies a connection between drinking coffee in the morning and gaining energy for a particular activity. The context of drinking coffee during a commute suggests that the activity in question is likely work, as many people drink coffee to help them stay alert and focused during work hours. The other options, such as playing sports or wrestling, do not align with the context of the sentence or the typical benefits of drinking coffee. Obesity and fatigue may be negative effects of a lack of energy, but they are not activities or goals that require extra energy. Answer is
work
Question: What might happen after buying too much beer? Options: A: self control,B: intoxication,C: pleasure,D: problems,E: relaxation,. Knowledge: Beer contains alcohol which, when consumed in large quantities, can lead to intoxication. Intoxication can cause impaired judgment, loss of coordination, and other effects that would not be associated with self control or relaxation. While pleasure may be a side effect of drinking beer, it is not necessarily a result of buying too much beer specifically. Problems could also be a consequence of buying too much beer, but the question is specifically asking about what might happen after the purchase. Answer is
intoxication
Question: The man was in a rut of selfish thoughts and decided to commit suicide, he didn't think of the what it would cause others? Options: A: would die,B: dying,C: pain,D: jubilation,E: end life,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man did not consider the impact his suicide would have on others, specifically the pain it would cause them. This is a common consequence of suicide, as the loved ones left behind often experience intense grief and emotional pain. The other options do not accurately reflect the consequences of suicide or the emotions associated with it. Answer is
pain
Question: The elephant swam the river with its trunk above the water, what could it do? Options: A: experience sadness,B: choke,C: remember everything,D: breathe,E: forget nothing,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the elephant's trunk is above the water while swimming, suggesting that it is using it to breathe. Elephants are known to use their trunk as a snorkel while swimming to breathe, as they cannot hold their breath for long periods of time. The options "experience sadness," "choke," "remember everything," and "forget nothing" do not relate to the context of the sentence. Answer is
breathe
Question: Hurting else is a crime, if convicted you could face what? Options: A: jail time,B: punishment,C: bad karma,D: will resent,E: a fight,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that hurting someone is a crime and the person could face consequences for it. Jail time is a common punishment for committing a crime and is therefore the most likely option. Punishment is a more generic option that could apply to any type of consequence, but jail time is a specific consequence that is commonly associated with crimes. Bad karma and will resent are not legal consequences and are therefore unlikely options. A fight is also not a legal consequence and is not a appropriate response to a crime. Answer is
jail time
Question: Where do you store your groceries when you drive home? Options: A: grocery cart,B: supermarket,C: pantry,D: shelf,E: trunk,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question is about where to store groceries while driving home in a car. The only option that makes sense for this context is the trunk of a car. The other options, such as grocery cart and supermarket, are not relevant to the context. Pantry and shelf are not applicable choices as they are not part of a car. Answer is
trunk
Question: Where can someone buy a fresh potato? Options: A: farmer's market,B: deep sea,C: bushel basket,D: ireland,E: grocery bag,. Knowledge: Fresh produce, including potatoes, is commonly sold at farmer's markets, which are known for carrying locally grown and harvested fruits and vegetables. Deep sea and bushel basket have no connection to potatoes. While Ireland is known for potatoes, the answer is asking where one can buy a fresh potato, and not necessarily in Ireland specifically. A grocery bag may contain potatoes, but it does not specify if they are fresh or not, as grocery stores may sell both fresh and pre-packaged potatoes. Answer is
farmer's market
Question: What does waiting for something for a response from an interview cause? Options: A: have fun,B: patience,C: anxiety,D: tedious,E: impatience,. Knowledge: The context of waiting for a response from an interview suggests that the individual is likely experiencing feelings of uncertainty, nervousness, and anticipation. These emotions are commonly associated with anxiety, which is a state of heightened mental and physical arousal in response to perceived threats or challenges. The other options, such as having fun or feeling tedious, do not fit the context of waiting for a response from an interview. Patience and impatience are related to waiting, but they do not accurately reflect the emotional state that typically accompanies waiting for an important outcome like a job interview. Answer is
anxiety
Question: The ranch house was built outside of Butte, where was it located? Options: A: countryside,B: neighborhood,C: desert,D: montana,E: subdivision,. Knowledge: The sentence provides a specific location, Butte, which is a city in the state of Montana. "Countryside" might be a possible option, but it is too broad and generic of a term to accurately describe the location of the ranch house. "Neighborhood" and "subdivision" imply a more urban or suburban setting, while "desert" is not a likely location for a ranch house in Montana. Therefore, "montana" is the best answer. Answer is
montana
Question: What device with a lens would you use to take photos? Options: A: microscope,B: device requires optics,C: telescope,D: spoon,E: camera,. Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a device with a lens that is used for taking photos.

A camera, on the other hand, is specifically designed to take photos using a lens. Answer is
camera
Question: Joe got his kid a plush bald Eagle.  Where did he probably get it from? Options: A: pet shop,B: great outdoors,C: nature reserve,D: canada,E: toy store,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe got a toy for his child (a plush bald eagle), rather than a live animal. This rules out options like pet shop, great outdoors, and nature reserve. The fact that it is a plush toy implies that it was purchased from a store that sells toys, which would be a toy store. Canada is an unlikely option as it is not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
toy store
Question: A birthday celebrates when a person reaches a what? Options: A: funeral,B: new age,C: die,D: happy,E: obesity,. Knowledge: The definition of a birthday involves marking the anniversary of a person's birth, which means celebrating when they have reached a new age. "Funeral", "die", and "obesity" are all irrelevant and negative options, and "happy" is too broad and doesn't relate specifically to the context of a birthday celebration. Answer is
new age
Question: The act of traveling is simple, you're just what? Options: A: relocation,B: disorientation,C: meeting new people,D: statue,E: getting somewhere,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the act of traveling is straightforward and uncomplicated. The phrase "just" implies that the answer is something basic or easy. "Relocation" implies a permanent move, rather than just traveling. "Disorientation" implies confusion or unease, which contradicts the idea that traveling is simple. "Meeting new people" is not necessarily a requirement for traveling. "Statue" is not related to the context of the sentence. "Getting somewhere" is the most straightforward and simple answer that aligns with the context of the sentence. Answer is
getting somewhere
Question: Where are leaves best left? Options: A: ground,B: street,C: trees,D: roof,E: in the garbage,. Knowledge: Leaves naturally belong on trees, as they are an important part of the tree's life cycle. Leaves collect sunlight to produce food through photosynthesis, and when they fall from the tree they provide nutrients to the soil. They can also provide shelter for animals and insects. The other options either don't make sense or would be harmful to the environment (e.g. leaving leaves in the street could block drains and cause flooding). Answer is
trees
Question: Someone who doesn't believe in the divine could be called what? Options: A: godless,B: humdrum,C: godless,D: horrible,E: undivine,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person being described does not believe in a higher power or deity, and "godless" is a commonly used term to describe such individuals. "Humdrum" and "horrible" do not have any connection to the context of the sentence, and "undivine" is not a commonly used term to describe a lack of belief in a divine being. Answer is
godless

dream dreams
Question: What do many people believe happens after you die? Options: A: stop moving,B: nothing,C: go to heaven,D: stop living,E: stop breathing,. Knowledge: The question is asking for a commonly held belief about what happens after death. While some people may believe in cessation of movement, breath, or life, the option "go to heaven" is a commonly held belief in many religions and cultures. "Nothing" is also a possible answer, but "go to heaven" is a more specific and commonly-believed outcome. Answer is
go to heaven
Question: How do children know they're in a dangerous situation? Options: A: experience fear,B: wave goodbye,C: listen a noise,D: watch television,E: spring into action,. Knowledge: Fear is a common and instinctual response to danger, and children often rely on this emotion to alert them to potential danger. Research has shown that even very young children are able to identify threatening or unsafe situations based on their emotional response. While some of the other options may be related to danger in certain contexts (such as listening for a noise that could indicate danger), experiencing fear is the most widely recognized and reliable indicator of danger for children. Answer is
experience fear
Question: The jury deliberated for hours, the choice of passing sentence required them to make a what? Options: A: court house,B: go to jail,C: death,D: appeals,E: judgement,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the jury was tasked with making a decision regarding the sentence for a criminal defendant. "Passing sentence" is a phrase commonly used in legal contexts to refer to the act of deciding what punishment to impose on a convicted individual. "Judgement" is a term often used in legal settings to describe a decision reached by a court or jury. "Court house" and "go to jail" are not relevant to this particular sentence, while "death" and "appeals" are potentially related to legal proceedings but do not directly address the question of what the jury had to do to pass sentence. Answer is
judgement
Question: Where is a dentist likely to be busy because of hockey? Options: A: minnesota,B: office building,C: city,D: street,E: fights,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a connection between hockey and a dentist being busy, indicating that there may be an increased demand for dental services in an area where hockey is popular. Minnesota is known for being home to several professional hockey teams and having a strong hockey culture, making it a likely choice for where a dentist may be busy due to hockey. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
minnesota
Question: If you do not have any corn, where would you get it? Options: A: pennsylvania,B: silo,C: supermarket,D: husks,E: container,. Knowledge: The question asks where to get corn if you don't have any, which suggests that you need to acquire it from somewhere else. The most common place to buy corn is at a supermarket, which is a retail store that sells groceries and other household items. The other options do not seem relevant to the context of the question, as Pennsylvania is a state, silos and containers are storage facilities, and husks are a part of the corn plant. Answer is
supermarket
Question: The young lady favored his wealth, she did not care how what he was? Options: A: youngstock,B: aged,C: mature,D: old,E: senior,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the young lady was drawn to the man's wealth and did not mind his age. "Old" is the only option that directly relates to age, while the other options do not provide any direct clue to the man's age. "Youngstock" may refer to young animals, "aged" may refer to something that has been aged, but it does not necessarily refer to age in humans, and "mature" and "senior" are often used to denote a certain stage in life but do not necessarily mean old age. Answer is
old
Question: The lizard was at the zoo, the protester stole it and returned it to the what? Options: A: wild,B: glass cage,C: restaurant,D: garden,E: galapagos archipelago,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lizard was originally kept in captivity at the zoo, but the protester stole it and returned it to its natural habitat. Therefore, the correct answer is "wild." The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - a glass cage is still a form of captivity, a restaurant is not a suitable habitat for a lizard, a garden may not be a suitable habitat for the specific type of lizard in question, and the Galapagos Archipelago is too far away and too specific to be a plausible answer. Answer is
wild

The other options do not have a clear connection to the topic of learning different ways of seeing the world. Answer is
study philosophy
Question: What is someone likely to feel while going into a trance? Options: A: sleepwalking,B: memory loss,C: hypnotized,D: confusion,E: peacefulness,. Knowledge: The word "trance" suggests a state of altered consciousness that is often associated with relaxation and peacefulness. The other options, such as sleepwalking or memory loss, do not match the typical characteristics of a trance state. Hypnotized individuals may feel relaxed, but the term "trance" typically refers to a self-induced state of deep relaxation rather than a state induced by a hypnotist. Confusion is not typically associated with trance states. Answer is
peacefulness
Question: Sarah tried to manage the evacuation, but it was difficult.  She needed special supplies because all around them was what? Options: A: egypt,B: work area,C: hospitals,D: city,E: desert,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah was managing an evacuation in a location that was difficult to navigate. The phrase "all around them" implies that the environment was a factor in why managing the evacuation was challenging. Of the options listed, "desert" is the most likely to present logistical difficulties during a crisis situation. The other options, such as "Egypt" or "city," could be challenging in their own right, but do not necessarily suggest the same kinds of obstacles as a desert environment. Answer is
desert
Question: The person answered the door when the mailman knocked, what likely happened next? Options: A: arm himself,B: cross street,C: feel sleepy,D: dog barked,E: receive mail,.

Question: Where is a person doing housework likely to work? Options: A: house guest,B: nice home,C: boredom,D: become tired,E: low pay,. Knowledge: The question is asking about where someone doing housework is likely to work, so it makes the most sense that they would be working in a nice home, as housework is typically associated with maintaining a clean and tidy living space.

nice home

Knowledge: The sentence implies that Charlie did not live near a school, which makes it unlikely that he attended one. The sentence also suggests that Charlie had a desire to learn, which makes it more likely that he turned to self-education. Of the choices, reading books is the most likely method for self-education, as it can be done at any time and from any location. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well. Answer is
read book
Question: Celebrating sports teams sometimes start what when they get out of hand? Options: A: dashing each others,B: intimacy,C: riots,D: happiness,E: headaches,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that celebrating sports teams can sometimes become uncontrollable and chaotic. "Riots" is the most logical choice as it is commonly associated with such situations. "Dashing each others" is nonsensical and "intimacy" and "happiness" do not fit the context of the sentence. "Headaches" is a possible consequence of a riot, but it is not the best answer given the other choices. Answer is
riots

Options: A: do many things,B: trained,C: withstand dehydration,D: require water,E: get lost,.

Knowledge: The sentence implies that James needed to store his duffel bag temporarily because he couldn't carry it with him. The options "bag lady's shopping cart" and "army barracks" are not likely locations for James to store his personal belongings. "Bus station" and "transit" are also unlikely options as they imply that James was travelling, which is not specified in the sentence. "Locker room" is the most suitable option as it is a common place for people to store their personal items when they don't want to carry them around. Answer is
locker room
Question: He chuckled to himself while hiking because of a saying, he had spotted a what on the mountain? Options: A: plains,B: molehill,C: crash plane,D: dale,E: anthill,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the protagonist found something amusing while hiking, and that it was related to a saying. The next part of the sentence mentions "spotted a what," implying that the protagonist saw something on the mountain. The word "Chuckled" suggests that whatever he saw was not serious or dangerous. Thus, among the options, a molehill fits the context best. It is a small and harmless feature of the landscape that is not commonly spotted while hiking, and it can be humorously compared to a mountain. The other options don't fit as well because they are either too big or too difficult to spot while hiking. Answer is
molehill

Canter is a three-beat gait that is faster than a trot, but not as fast as a gallop. Trot is a two-beat diagonal gait, while eat oats and drink water are completely unrelated to the question.

The other options, such as a jungle or a motel, do not typically have such amenities and would not be likely places for an isolated swimming pool. The YMCA and California are both too broad to determine whether they have isolated swimming pools. Answer is
resort hotel

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object is specifically designed for storing and dispensing pills. The options "medicine cabinet," "pharmacy," and "box" are too general and could refer to a variety of objects that may or may not be used for storing pills.

"Medicine bottle" is the most specific and appropriate option, as it is a common household item used for storing and dispensing medication, and often requires a twisting motion to open. Answer is
medicine bottle

This sort of self-improvement would likely result in a person feeling better about themselves, which is the best answer choice in the given options.

The other options do not necessarily involve buying and selling products, or do not fit the context of the sentence (such as "cost one dollar"). A shelf may have products for sale, but it suggests a more limited selection and is often associated with retail stores rather than a marketplace. A salon is typically associated with personal services such as haircuts or beauty treatments, rather than buying products, and a demonstration suggests a presentation or exhibition rather than a commercial venue for selling goods.

The term "maritime" refers to things related to the sea, such as boats, navigation, and marine life, so a maritime museum would be a likely place to display a preserved shark.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that thrill seeking people who love competition could possibly be found in one of the choices provided. Out of the options, "race cars" is the most likely choice as it is a competitive sport that involves speed and danger, attracting thrill seekers who enjoy taking risks. The other choices, such as "a taxi cab," "learn from each other," and "fear death," do not correlate with the idea of competing and seeking thrills. "Fight each other" could be seen as competitive, but the sentence implies that the choice is related to a specific activity or location, rather than a general behavior. Answer is
race cars
Question: When the man was preparing for having a bath, what did he look for in the water? Options: A: being clear,B: get wet,C: bathing soap,D: will drown,E: personal cleanliness,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man was preparing for a bath and was looking for a specific quality in the water. The phrase "being clear" indicates that the man was searching for water that was transparent and free from impurities or dirt. This is a common expectation when someone is preparing for a bath, as the purpose of the bath is usually to clean oneself. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "get wet" is not something one needs to search for when preparing for a bath, "bathing soap" is an accessory and not a quality of the water, "will drown" is not a desirable outcome of bathing, and "personal cleanliness" is the purpose of the bath, not a quality of the water. Answer is
being clear

The other options do not seem to fit the context of the sentence, as they are either too general (europe) or unrelated to the idea of socializing and networking (suit, university, church, restaurant). Answer is

This indicates that she may have been looking forward to receiving a particular gift that did not end up being part of her presents, leading to disappointment. The other options, such as excitement or satisfaction, would not be appropriate in this context where the speaker is unhappy with the nature of the gifts they were receiving. Answer is

fear death
Question: What does someone need when they're feeling hunger? Options: A: starvation,B: eat hamburger,C: eating,D: pizza,E: discomfort,. Knowledge: The question is asking what someone needs when they're feeling hunger, so the best answer would be the option that satisfies that need. Hunger is a biological signal that our bodies use to signal the need for food, so the correct answer would be "eating".

Answer is
eating

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is struggling to finish reading a book because they are tired or sleepy. The phrase "kept" implies that the person is trying to stay awake, but is having difficulty doing so. "Falling asleep" is the most likely choice because it accurately reflects this situation. "Sit" and "learning" do not make sense in this context, and "the light on" is a distractor that does not relate to the sentence. Answer is
falling asleep

feel anger

suffer hunger

The term "trouble" is often used to describe negative consequences that someone may face for their actions, which is why it is the most likely choice in this context. The other options do not fit as well because they do not convey the sense of negative consequences that the sentence suggests. Answer is
trouble

Knowledge: The question states that you are relaxing and have your eyes closed, which suggests that you are engaging in an activity that does not require visual focus. The options "read book", "watching tv", and "reading" all involve visual engagement, which is therefore unlikely. "Falling asleep" is also unlikely since the question specifies that you are still awake. "Listening to music", however, is an activity that can easily be done with eyes closed and also fits the context of relaxation. Answer is
listening to music

Question: Why do people primarily partake in surfing? Options: A: getting in shape,B: to get wet,C: getting wet,D: enjoyment,E: shark attacks,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a specific reason why people participate in surfing, and the word "primarily" implies that this reason is the main motivation for most surfers. While getting in shape and getting wet may be secondary benefits of surfing, neither of these options reflects the main reason why people choose to partake in the sport. Shark attacks, although they are a risk associated with surfing, are not a reason why someone would choose to surf. Therefore, enjoyment is the most likely correct answer. Surfing is a popular recreational activity that is enjoyed by many people around the world, and the exhilaration of riding waves is often cited as the primary reason why people choose to participate in it. Answer is
enjoyment

While bands, operas, and ball events can all provide live shows, the word "performances" is a key word that highlights the relevance of the choice "show" over the others.

The use of the word "efficiency" in the answer reflects this implication, as it suggests that dividing tasks in this manner allows for the completion of all tasks in a quicker and more streamlined manner.

Knowledge: The word "kitchenette" suggests a small kitchen area, which is often found in apartments rather than houses or dorm rooms. The phrase "stacked on top of each other" implies that the dwelling type is a multi-story building like an apartment complex, and not a one-story apartment or a house. A hotel room may have a mini-fridge and a microwave, but these do not qualify as a kitchenette. Answer is

The options "farm" and "property" imply a larger land area than a typical residential property, making them less likely choices. "Neighborhood" and "yards" are also too generic and do not provide specific information about the family's living situation. Therefore, "suburb" is the most appropriate answer as it implies a residential area with houses and yards. Answer is
suburb

The most practical mode of transportation for soldiers on the move or in combat situations is an armored car, which offers protection and mobility. The option "battlefield" is not a mode of transportation, but rather a place where soldiers engage in combat. Answer is

A furniture store is a retail business that sells furniture, such as chairs and other household items.

Hobby Lobby and instruments may sell metal items, but they are unlikely to sell used items. Ore is a type of raw material used to make metal, not a place to buy used metal items. Cars may contain metal parts, but they are not a place to specifically buy used metal items. A junkyard, on the other hand, is a common place to find previously owned and used metal items, making it the most likely correct answer. Answer is
junkyard

The options "get messy," "cleaning," and "get dirty" are not correct because these actions are not being complained about.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lizard is trying to avoid the heat, which means it is likely looking for a cooler location. The options "sunny place" and "rocky areas" are both associated with heat and exposure to sunlight, so they are unlikely to be the correct answers.

"Shady spot" is the most likely answer because it provides a cooler and more comfortable location for the lizard to rest. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the citizens are complaining about the condition of a roadway, which is something that falls under the responsibility of a city government. Neighborhoods and subdivisions may have their own local authorities, but they would not have the authority or resources to address major road repairs.

The countryside is too broad a term to have any relevance to this sentence. Answer is

The options "toy store," "toy shop," and "toy factory" are unlikely to have the stolen yoyo because they are not associated with the context of the sentence. "Own home" is also unlikely because the sentence suggests that the yoyo was stolen, which means it is not in the possession of the person who owns it. "Brother's room" is the most likely option because the bratty young person may have been a sibling or someone who had access to the owner's room. Answer is

This is supported by the use of the phrase "he'd be lying if he didn't," indicating that the desire for wealth is something the person is not admitting openly.

A lamp is a common household item used for lighting, so it is a likely choice in this context. The other options do not make sense in the given situation. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the faithful are engaging in an act of communication during their prayer, which is commonly associated with talking to god. Kneeling down may be a physical posture associated with prayer, but it does not necessarily imply communication with a deity.

Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be a positive emotion or feeling that is associated with job satisfaction. French fries and hamburgers are both types of fast food, but they do not necessarily indicate any emotional state. Enjoyment would be a possible answer, but there is no clear indication that the man enjoyed his job for any reason other than getting to eat hamburgers.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location for the light source should be within the home and specifically in a place where someone may trip. The most logical option is the hallway, which is a common pathway in a home and often has limited natural light sources. The other options, such as the street or sky, are located outside and not relevant to the context of the sentence. Flashlight and books could be a source of light, but not necessarily in the context of moving through one's home. Answer is
hallway
Question: What do you want to do to conquer opponent? Options: A: make fun of,B: win,C: total domination,D: best,E: compete,. Knowledge: The word "conquer" suggests a sense of competition or battle, where one side must emerge victorious over the other. The option "win" directly relates to this idea of beating one's opponent and is the most logical choice. "Make fun of" is not a suitable option as it is not a strategy for defeating an opponent, and "best" and "compete" do not convey the same level of intensity as the word "conquer." "Total domination" is a possible option but is less commonly used and may not fit the context of the question. Answer is

This aligns with the concept of monastic life, which often involves living in a community and devoting oneself to prayer, meditation, and other spiritual practices while eschewing material possessions and worldly pursuits. The other options do not fit as neatly with the context of the sentence, such as "eternal," which is too abstract and unspecific, and "married life," which implies a different kind of lifestyle altogether. Answer is
monastic

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that knitting can cause some sort of illness or condition in the hands. Arthritis is a common condition that affects the joints, including those in the hands, and can be caused or worsened by repetitive movements such as those involved in knitting. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence, and "have fun" and "relaxation" seem especially unlikely given that the sentence is discussing a potential negative outcome of the activity. "Shredded hands" may seem plausible given that knitting can be tough on the skin of the fingertips, but it is not a recognized medical condition. Answer is

A yard may have trees that bear fruit or nuts, but it is not their primary purpose, and not all yards have fruit trees. A state park may have trees that produce food, but it is not their primary purpose and they may not be accessible for harvesting. A market is a place to buy food, not grow it. The surface of the earth refers to the entire planet and has no specific association with trees that provide food. Answer is

The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence or are less commonly associated with the effects of alcohol consumption. Answer is

The options "cheeks," "parents," "muscles," and "common sense" do not fit this pattern, as they are not traits that sociopaths are known to lack. However, sociopaths are often characterized as lacking or having difficulty understanding and experiencing emotions or feelings, so this is likely the correct answer. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the use of a machine gun is associated with a specific field or profession. The options "quake 2" and "arsenal" are video game and weapon-related terms, respectively, and are not relevant to the context of the sentence.

The verb "unfastened" implies that the fly was previously closed, and therefore needs to be "fastened" or closed again. The options "do up," "tie up," and "button up" all suggest the use of buttons or ties to fasten the fly, but trousers typically have a zipper instead. Therefore, "zip up" is the correct answer. "Pick up" is not related to fastening clothing and doesn't make sense in this context. Answer is

The options "pain" and "small cuts" may be common in sports, but they do not necessarily apply to fencing specifically. "Competition" is not a risk, but rather a component of the sport itself.

Movie theatres and circus tents are not typically used for classical music performances.

This knowledge can help eliminate options like "ridiculous" and "happiness" which are not typically associated with this type of situation.

Question: What would happen to a building if it is not needed any more? Options: A: cast shadow,B: fall down,C: target,D: weather storm,E: face north,. Knowledge: The question is asking about the consequences of a building that is no longer needed. In general, if a building is not maintained or used, it will eventually deteriorate and collapse. This is because buildings are designed to withstand the weight and stresses of their intended use, and if they are left unoccupied and unmaintained, the structural integrity can be compromised. The other options do not make sense in this context - casting a shadow, facing north, or being a target are not necessarily related to a building's usefulness or condition, and weathering a storm could potentially damage a building, but it would not cause it to collapse entirely. Answer is
fall down

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone wants to bring about change in their society, which requires some kind of action from their government. The option "new laws" is the most logical choice as laws are often used to regulate society and bring about change. "Happiness for" is not clear in its meaning and does not relate to the context of the sentence. "Give up" and "acceptance" do not suggest any proactive measures for bringing about change. "Cultural revolution" may bring about change, but it is not necessarily something that the government can provide. Answer is
new laws

The option 'farmyard' may not apply if the owner has no access to one. Answer is

The options "chef," "abc book," and "museum" do not fit this context at all.

Learning the language is a crucial step in achieving this, as it allows the student to communicate with locals, read signs and menus, and understand instructions.

The options "Mexico," "Texas," and "New York" are all locations within the Western hemisphere and therefore their cuisine would not be unfamiliar to Western palettes. The option "ocean" is not a location and does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Therefore, the cooking style is most likely from a location outside of the Western hemisphere, which narrows down the options to Japan. Japanese cuisine is known for its unique and distinct flavors, and therefore it is likely that the cooking style of the steak house originated from Japan. Answer is

The word "hated" also indicates a strong negative emotional reaction, which rules out the options of linearity and have to wait for as being too neutral.

Options: A: being able to use,B: know how to act,C: full capacity,D: solution to problem,E: gaining knowledge,.

The most logical option would be "being able to use" since finding information on how to operate something would equip the person with the necessary knowledge to properly use the item. "Know how to act" could be a possibility, but it is not as directly related to operating something. "Full capacity" and "solution to problem" are also not directly related to operating something, while "gaining knowledge" is too broad and does not specifically address the purpose of finding information on operating something. Answer is
being able to use

Therefore, the most likely reason people want to swim is to cool down. The other options - wearing a bathing suit, having fun, or exercising - could also be reasons people swim, but they do not directly address the issue of being hot and needing to cool down. Additionally, "exercise" is listed twice, but it is not necessarily a reason people want to swim in the heat. Answer is

Question: What benefit can you get from watch tv? Options: A: have tv,B: distraction,C: learn,D: fall asleep,E: sitting,.

Watching TV can also provide an opportunity to learn new information or gain knowledge about a variety of topics, whether through educational programming or simply exposure to different perspectives and ideas. Therefore, the correct answer is "learn." The option "have TV" seems like it may be a possible benefit, but it is not a benefit FROM watching TV, but rather an access to watching TV. The option "sitting" may not be a benefit either, as it is not something that comes directly from watching TV, but rather a part of the experience of watching TV. Answer is
learn

Grooming involves the use of sharp tools and potentially hot water, so it's important for the dog to remain still. Mistakes, being late, and beauty are not directly related to the potential consequences of a dog wiggling during grooming. Pain may be a possible consequence, but injury is the most specific and likely outcome. Answer is
injury

The word "small" also suggests that these city halls are not located in busy commercial areas like downtown, but rather in smaller communities such as towns. The option "court" may seem plausible, but it does not fit the context of the question as it refers to a specific type of building rather than a general location. Answer is

Having fun might be a possible answer, but it does not capture the physical aspect suggested by the "playing" verb. Answer is

Knowledge: Hammers are traditionally made with a metal head and a wooden handle. The wooden handle provides a comfortable grip for the user and helps to absorb the shock of the striking force.

Living in poverty is a common reason for being unable to afford a home, and is therefore the most likely answer.

Wealth is the opposite of living in poverty, and is therefore not a viable answer. Answer is
live in poverty

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the friend is a professional musician who earns a living playing trumpet. Among the choices, an orchestra is the most likely place for a professional trumpet player to work as it typically has a full range of brass instruments, including trumpets, and performs a wide variety of music genres. A music shop is unlikely to provide enough income for a professional musician, and a brass band or high school band may not have enough budget to hire a full-time trumpeter. Answer is
orchestra

The option "older generation" best fits this context, as the uncle is likely the eldest in his family and is therefore the closest living connection to the older generation. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. The correct spelling of "aunt's house" should also be noted, as it is incorrect in one of the options. Answer is

Question: What could stop someone from staying healthy? Options: A: live long,B: sadness,C: injury,D: long life,E: happiness,.

Options like "live long" and "happiness" are positive factors and don't fit the context of the question. "Sadness" could contribute to poor mental health, but not necessarily physical health. "Long life" is not an obstacle to staying healthy, but rather a desired outcome. "Injury," on the other hand, is a clear factor that could prevent someone from maintaining good physical health. It could lead to restricted movement, chronic pain, and other health complications. Therefore, "injury" is the correct answer. Answer is

This suggests that the person is interested in creating music, rather than simply practicing or performing for fun. Therefore, the correct answer is "making music". The other options, such as "calluses" and "playing wrong note", are not related to the goal of wanting to record music, and "audition" and "read music" could be related, but do not match the specific context of the sentence. Answer is
making music

In this context, it is likely that the "fraternity house" option is the correct answer as it is a common location for college parties and drinking. The other options do not have a direct connection to the context of the sentence, as a wedding, friend's house, and school are not typically associated with Greek life partying. While a bar could be a possibility, the mention of a fraternity house suggests a more specific location. Answer is
fraternity house
Question: What does a birthday do to someone? Options: A: regret,B: indoor plumbing,C: feel special,D: own house,E: electricity,.

Therefore, it makes sense to look for a fabric store where they sell a variety of fabrics, including tweed. The other options, such as clothing stores or Eddie Bauer, may sell clothing made out of tweed, but they may not have the specific fabric available for purchase. Additionally, buying online may be an option, but it may be harder to confirm the quality and texture of the fabric without seeing it in person. Answer is

Question: What do children often do before bed? Options: A: play games,B: push ups,C: play with toys,D: hear stories,E: throw things,.

The phrase "play tricks on" and the word "hatred" have negative connotations and do not make sense in the context of the sentence.

Answer is
form images

The other options may be places where balls are commonly used or found, but they do not necessarily provide a means for obtaining one. Cuddle is not a relevant option as it has no connection to the context of the question. Answer is

Answer is
gas station
Question: The storm was surprising, where didn't it show up for meteorologists? Options: A: train,B: tropical seas,C: weather report,D: america,E: caribbean,.

"Medical center" is a reasonable option, but the sentence specifies that the office is in a "strange place," which does not necessarily describe a typical medical center. "Town" and "patient" do not make sense in the context of the sentence.

Answer is

Question: What are birds likely to do in the winter? Options: A: learn to fly,B: spread wings,C: fly north,D: fly high,E: head south,. Knowledge: Many bird species migrate to warmer climates during the winter to avoid harsh weather conditions and to find sources of food. The phrase "head south" suggests that the birds are likely to fly in a southerly direction during this time. The other options do not fit the context of the question, as it is already assumed that the birds are capable of flying and spreading their wings. Learning to fly is something that birds do as fledglings, not as adults. Flying north may be appropriate for some species during the spring and summer months, but it would not make sense for them to do so during the winter when temperatures are cold. Flying high may be an option for some birds, but it is not a necessary or distinguishing behavior for winter migration. Answer is
head south

A duffle bag is a common type of luggage that is easy to carry, which suggests that James was not traveling by car or plane. The options "store," "sporting goods store," and "locker room" do not suggest any connection to travel or transportation.

Telling jokes is related to making people laugh, but not everyone enjoys jokes and they may not be appropriate in all situations. Answer is
make people laugh

The options "of states" and "united states" do not provide any relevant information, while "american state" is redundant since the sentence already mentions a state highway. Therefore, "traffic" cannot be the correct answer. California is known for having heavy traffic congestion, especially on its highways, making it the most likely answer. Answer is

Question: What kind of entertainment may feature a talking weasel on an adventure? Options: A: children's story,B: forrest,C: mulberry bush,D: animated film,E: outdoors,. Knowledge: The use of the term "animated" suggests that the entertainment in question involves some form of animation, which is typically associated with films. Additionally, anthropomorphized talking animals are a common feature in animated films for children, which eliminates options such as forrest, mulberry bush, and outdoors. The phrase "on an adventure" also implies a narrative structure, which is another characteristic of animated films. Therefore, the correct answer is animated film. Answer is
animated film

The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence and are not logical actions a person would take if they miss their aunt. Answer is
visit relatives

Knowledge: Local area codes are typically associated with specific geographic regions or cities, so if a call is coming from a local area code, it is likely that the caller is located in that area or nearby. The other options (office, motel, desktop, rest area) do not necessarily have a direct connection to the use of a local area code. Answer is
neighbor's house
Question: What is it called when life has an end date? Options: A: finite,B: over,C: good,D: important,E: ending soon,. Knowledge: The question is referring to the concept of life having a limit or an end date.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the gun was not in a proper storage or carrying device, which resulted in discomfort for the person carrying it. The most logical option to alleviate the discomfort would be to put the gun in a holster, which is a device designed specifically to hold a firearm securely and comfortably on a person's body. The other options, such as a drawer, crime scene, police helicopter, and police station, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
holster

Knowledge: The word "laconic" means using very few words, or being brief in speech. Therefore, the professor was not using a lot of words or being overly talkative, indicating that he was probably avoiding verbose language. The other options are all words that would describe using too many words, being overly complex, or overly dramatic in language, which is opposite to the meaning of "laconic". Answer is
verbose
Question: How would a human verbally great another? Options: A: drink tea,B: have to sleep,C: eat food,D: say hello,E: need money,. Knowledge: Greeting someone verbally is a common practice in human interaction. While other options may be part of human behavior, such as eating or sleeping, they do not necessarily relate to the act of greeting someone.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
say hello
Question: During the roadtrip they finally stopped seeing signs for falling rock, there surroundings were getting less step as the entered the open what? Options: A: mountain range,B: countryside,C: volcano,D: ground,E: bridge,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the travelers were moving away from a mountainous area, as they were no longer seeing signs warning of falling rocks. This implies that they were entering a flatter area, which is commonly associated with countryside. Volcanoes and mountain ranges would not be described as "less steep" as they are inherently steep. "Ground" and "bridge" do not logically fit in the context of the sentence. Answer is
countryside
Question: What is used in a bathroom when towels aren't available to get water off your hads? Options: A: dryer,B: roof,C: swimming pool,D: gym,E: pants,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that towels are not available in the bathroom, which suggests that an alternative method for drying hands is needed.

Answer is
dryer
Question: Where can leaves slide from and end up in a gutter? Options: A: trees,B: spout,C: roof,D: ground,E: street,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that leaves are sliding from a higher place (likely a roof) and ending up in a gutter. This would make sense as leaves on trees or the ground would not have the necessary elevation to slide into a gutter. A spout is also unlikely as it is usually connected to the gutter and wouldn't allow leaves to slide in. The street also does not make sense as gutters are usually located on the sides of buildings or homes, not in the middle of a street. Answer is
roof
Question: Though a bald eagle is synonymous with the USA, they can be found in what two word province too? Options: A: utah,B: france,C: chemotherapy,D: rocky mountains,E: british columbia,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that bald eagles are not exclusive to the USA, and that they can be found in another place that is described as a "two word province." The option "british columbia" fits this description as it is a Canadian province located in the western region of the country, known for its abundance of wildlife and diverse ecosystems including coastal rainforests, mountains, and islands - all of which are ideal habitats for bald eagles. The other options do not fit the description of a two-word province, and do not have any clear connection to bald eagles. Answer is
british columbia

Options: A: hear testimony,B: examine thing,C: surf net,D: browsing,E: see exhibits,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the group was on a tour and the tour guide was providing information about different things. The phrase "then took the group to" implies that the tour guide was leading them to a specific destination. The option "see exhibits" is the most logical answer as exhibits are usually the main attraction of a tour and are something people would be taken to. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as they do not relate to a physical destination that the tour guide would lead the group to. Answer is
see exhibits
Question: What might a doctor have to do in an emergency? Options: A: study medicine,B: care for patients,C: provide care,D: resuscitate,E: perform a physical,.

In such a situation, a doctor or any medical professional must perform resuscitation, which includes techniques such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or using a defibrillator to restart the patient's heart. Studying medicine, caring for patients, providing care, and performing a physical are all essential responsibilities of a doctor, but they may not be directly related to an emergency situation. Answer is
resuscitate
Question: The iphone can do many things.  If you threw away your iPod, you probably use your iPhone to do what? Options: A: show time,B: use calendar,C: display time,D: display position on map,E: play music,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the iPhone has features that can replace those of an iPod, which is a music player. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be related to music. Of the options provided, "play music" is the most closely related to the function of an iPod, while the others are more general features that the iPhone offers. Answer is
play music
Question: Some people just want to get away from it all, but that can be a problem if many people are also visiting the what? Options: A: disneyland,B: circus,C: supermarket,D: carnival,E: state park,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the problem with getting away from it all is that many people are also visiting the same place. This makes sense for state parks, which are often popular destinations for nature lovers looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. However, the other options are less likely to be crowded, especially considering that the sentence implies that many people are also visiting the same place. Disneyland, circus, supermarket, and carnival are generally crowded places, so they would not be suitable for getting away from it all. Answer is
state park
Question: How do you get good at playing guitar? Options: A: polish your guitar regularly.,B: pick,C: practice,D: have fun,E: desire,. Knowledge: The most commonly accepted way to improve your skills in playing guitar is through practice. This involves consistently playing and practicing your skills over time, which helps you develop muscle memory and improve your technique. While polishing your guitar and having fun may also be important factors in enjoying the experience of playing guitar, they are not necessarily the key to becoming good at it. Similarly, having a desire or passion for playing guitar may motivate you to practice more, but it alone will not make you a skilled player. The term "pick" may refer to a guitar pick, but it is not a complete answer to the question and does not provide enough information to demonstrate knowledge of guitar-playing. Answer is
practice

Options: A: patience,B: intention,C: decision-making skills,D: buying movie tickets,E: basic organization,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the dog was able to get the sheep in line, which requires a certain level of organization to achieve. Basic organization skills, such as grouping similar items together or arranging things in a particular order, can be useful in controlling and directing the movements of others. Patience, intention, and decision-making skills may also be useful for a dog in this situation, but the sentence specifically mentions the dog's ability to organize the sheep. Buying movie tickets is unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
basic organization

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mary was singing as a way to improve her mood, as she was not happy. Singing is often used as a form of self-expression and can be a cathartic activity that helps to release emotions. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence, as Mary's singing is not related to physical ailments such as sore throats or hoarse voices, and being heard or sad are not specific motivations for her singing. Answer is
change in mood
Question: What is a great thing to do with used glass? Options: A: shattered,B: recycled,C: shatter,D: tempered,E: broken,. Knowledge: The question is asking for a positive action to take with used glass. Shattering, shatter, tempered, and broken all suggest destructive actions, so those options can be eliminated. Recycling, on the other hand, is a positive and environmentally-friendly action to take with used glass. Glass can be melted down and reused to create new products, reducing waste and conserving resources. Answer is
recycled
Question: The marathon included dancing for as long as possible for a prize, what did people feel as a result? Options: A: humiliation,B: sweaty,C: fatigue,D: blisters,E: exhaustion,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the marathon involved physically demanding activity (dancing) for a prolonged period of time, which would logically result in exhaustion. The other options (humiliation, sweaty, blisters) do not necessarily follow from the information given and seem less likely to be a direct consequence of the activity described. Fatigue is also a possibility, but exhaustion is a stronger and more specific answer choice. Answer is
exhaustion
Question: Someone who's belief in a philosophy is not slight but extreme is what? Options: A: significant,B: important,C: radical,D: radical,E: essencial,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's belief in a philosophy is not slight, but extreme. The word "radical" means extreme, especially in terms of political or social beliefs. The other options do not convey the same level of extremeness or intensity. "Significant" and "important" are neutral words that do not imply any extreme beliefs or actions, while "essencial" is a misspelling of the word "essential." Answer is
radical
Question: When Bob plugs has electricity next to his nightstand, where is he? Options: A: church,B: concert,C: opera,D: bedroom,E: restaurant,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob has access to electricity next to his nightstand, which is typically found in a bedroom. This eliminates the options of church, concert, opera, and restaurant, which are unlikely places to have a nightstand with an electrical outlet. Answer is
bedroom
Question: John thought the distance between himself ahd Sally was insurmountable.  But when he opened up to her, he found that they shared something What did they share? Options: A: near,B: proximity,C: closeness,D: close,E: duration,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John initially thought that the distance between him and Sally was a problem, but that they later found out that they shared something. Based on this, it seems that the answer is likely to be a term that refers to emotional or psychological closeness between two people. "Closeness" therefore seems to be the most appropriate option, as it directly implies a sense of intimacy or emotional proximity. "Near," "proximity," and "close" are similar in meaning but do not necessarily suggest an emotional connection. "Duration" is completely unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
closeness
Question: What do I cook on the stove when I want to make tacos? Options: A: brown meat,B: mexico,C: open can,D: bake bread,E: warm food,. Knowledge: Tacos typically involve a meat filling, such as ground beef, that needs to be cooked before it can be added to the taco shell. The phrase "cook on the stove" is a clue that the answer involves a cooking method, and out of the given choices, only "brown meat" is a cooking method that involves cooking something on a stove. The other choices, like "Mexico" and "bake bread," do not make sense in the context of cooking tacos. Answer is
brown meat
Question: The bald eagle flew over the potato fields over what region of the place known for them? Options: A: alaska,B: hells canyon,C: south lake tahoe,D: central idaho,E: canada,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there are potato fields in this region, which narrows down the choices to regions known for potato farming. Alaska, Hells Canyon, and South Lake Tahoe are not typically associated with potato farming, while both Idaho and Canada are well-known for their potato production. However, the mention of "central" in the sentence indicates that the correct answer is Central Idaho, rather than Canada which is a larger country with potato fields in multiple regions. Answer is
central idaho
Question: If you see materials surrounded by workers you may be in what zone? Options: A: hazardous waste,B: construction,C: fabric store,D: science lab,E: house,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that workers are surrounding materials, which implies that there is some sort of construction or building work happening in the area. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. A hazardous waste zone might have materials and workers, but the sentence does not mention anything about hazardous materials specifically. A fabric store, science lab, or house would not typically have workers surrounding materials in the same way a construction site would. Answer is
construction
Question: Where is one likely to find many lawns? Options: A: golf course,B: front yard,C: suburbia,D: neighborhood,E: michigan,. Knowledge: Lawns are typically associated with residential areas where homeowners have front or back yards.

Golf courses may have many lawns, but they are not common in everyday life and are usually reserved for recreational activities. The other options, such as a neighborhood or Michigan, do not have a clear association with lawns. Answer is
suburbia
Question: What would someone say about a tube television? Options: A: obsolete,B: addictive,C: entertaining,D: bycone,E: legal,. Knowledge: The word "obsolete" means that something is no longer in use or has become outdated. Tube televisions are old technology that have largely been replaced by newer, more advanced displays like LCD and LED screens. Therefore, it would be accurate to describe a tube television as obsolete. The other options don't fit the context of the question- addictive, entertaining, bycone and legal all don't make sense in relation to a tube television. Answer is
obsolete

Knowledge: Texas is a state in the United States of America, located in the southern part of the country. It is bordered by Mexico to the south, but is not located within Mexico. Texaphyrin is a chemical compound and has no relation to the location of Texas. Southwest and Gulf States refer to regions within the United States, but do not answer the specific question of where Texas is located. Answer is
united states
Question: John didn't like going to the square, but he did anyway.   Where might the square be? Options: A: geometry,B: circle,C: town center,D: fifties,E: carpenter's tool box,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the square is a location that John could go to despite his dislike for it, suggesting it is a place that is frequently visited. "Town center" is a common term used to describe the central commercial and social hub of a town, which would fit the context of the sentence. The other options do not relate to a place that someone could go to on a regular basis. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is something that everything is made of, which is a broad concept that encompasses all the choices given. However, the use of the phrase "when one thinks enough about it" implies that the answer may not be immediately obvious or intuitive. The options "cupboard," "own home," "stuff in home," and "garbage dump" are all specific and limited in scope, making them unlikely correct answers. "Everything" is the most all-encompassing and abstract option, aligning with the idea that all things are made of something. Answer is
everything

They then waited a quarter past a certain time before turning on the football game.

The other options do not make sense in the context of waiting for a specific event to happen at a particular time. Answer is

Question: All people need to move, otherwise what will atrophy? Options: A: feelings,B: shrink,C: free will,D: muscles,E: parents,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions a physical need to move and suggests that if this need is not met, something will atrophy, which typically refers to a decline or wasting away of muscles.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the child has finished playing with their toys and needs to do something next. The option "clean room" is the most logical choice as it is a common instruction given to children after they finish playing with their toys. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - "go to bed" is more suitable as a bedtime instruction, "become adult" and "grow up" are milestones that occur over time and not something that can be done immediately, and "read book" is not related to cleaning up after playing with toys. Answer is
clean room

The option "hole" is clearly not appropriate for the sentence. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the poet needed to write about his distant past, which is likely to be related to his personal life experiences. Therefore, the most appropriate place for the poet to go to write about his past is likely to be his own home, where he may have access to personal documents, photographs or other memorabilia that can help him remember his past experiences.

Knowledge: A stylus is a small tool used to interact with touchscreens, and is typically associated with devices like smartphones, tablets, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) like the Palm Pilot.

Knowledge: A towel is often used in a gym for wiping sweat off during or after a workout, and it makes sense to keep them close by in the locker room where gym-goers change and store their belongings.

locker room

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob is not going to bed despite it being a weekday, which implies that he is not able to sleep.

Knowledge: The question implies that the eraser will be used in class, so it should be brought to school. The choices "office supply store" and "schools" are not places to put the eraser, but rather places to acquire an eraser. "Under the arm" is not a practical place to put an eraser while traveling. The most logical answer is to put the eraser in a pencil box, which can be easily carried to class. Answer is
pencil box
Question: A shark is stuck in a lake, where does it need to go provided it isn't a bull shark? Options: A: medium,B: saltwater,C: sea world,D: atlantic ocean,E: seawater,. Knowledge: Sharks are typically found in saltwater environments, such as the ocean. Bull sharks are one of the few shark species that can tolerate freshwater and are sometimes found in rivers and lakes. However, the question specifically states that it is not a bull shark, so the answer must be one of the options related to saltwater environments. Sea world is a theme park and not a location where a shark could go to live, so it can be ruled out. "Medium" and "seawater" may not be specific enough to indicate that the shark needs to go to a saltwater environment, whereas "Atlantic Ocean" specifically refers to a saltwater environment. Therefore, "saltwater" is the best answer. Answer is
saltwater
Question: The men talked at length and found they were agreeing with a lot of things, how would they describe their feeling toward one another? Options: A: problem,B: peace,C: love,D: contract,E: like,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the men had a positive conversation and found common ground, which suggests they had a friendly relationship. Describing their feeling toward one another as "like" would be a natural choice to convey this sense of mutual respect and agreement. The other options do not accurately reflect the context of the sentence. "Problem" and "contract" have negative connotations and do not fit with the positive tone of the conversation. "Peace" and "love" are also unlikely choices as they suggest a deeper emotional connection that may not be present in this context. Answer is
like

furniture store
Question: What might intense competing cause someone to feel? Options: A: argument,B: tension,C: anger,D: happiness,E: stress,. Knowledge: The word "intense" suggests a high level of competition, which can be a source of stress for many people. Stress is a common response to intense competition because it can cause feelings of pressure, anxiety, and overwhelm. The other options, like argument and tension, may be outcomes of intense competition, but they are not directly related to how someone might feel in response to it. Anger and happiness are also unlikely because they are emotions that are typically associated with a personal victory or defeat, rather than a response to competition itself. Answer is
stress
Question: Every Monday morning he would meet friend, they would have coffee and a good what? Options: A: say'hi,B: have sex,C: conversation,D: handshake,E: train,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person meets their friend every Monday morning to engage in an activity that involves both coffee and conversation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Saying "hi" or shaking hands could be a part of the greeting, but they would not typically be the main activity. Having sex or taking a train do not make sense in this context. Answer is
conversation
Question: Where is a good place to get food for most people? Options: A: fridge,B: oven,C: supermarket,D: kitchen,E: table,. Knowledge: The question suggests that the answer should refer to a place where most people can get food, which rules out options like the fridge, oven, and kitchen as not everyone has access to these. The table is also not a good answer as it is not a place where one can get food, but rather a surface where food can be served. The most plausible answer is the supermarket, as it is a place where a variety of foods can be purchased and is accessible to most people. Answer is
supermarket
Question: The predator was committing murder, what was his intention to his victim? Options: A: kill,B: distress,C: strangle,D: die,E: dead,.

The other options may also be associated with causing harm or pain to someone, but they do not specifically relate to causing death. Answer is
kill
Question: What should a savvy consumer do when being presented with proof for the effectiveness of a product that seem too good to be true? Options: A: exasperation,B: change of heart,C: scrutinizing,D: boredom,E: read,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the consumer should be cautious when presented with proof that seems too good to be true. Scrutinizing means examining something closely and carefully, which is a good approach to determine whether the proof is legitimate or not. Exasperation, change of heart, and boredom do not suggest any action the consumer can take to evaluate the proof. Reading is a general action and does not necessarily relate to the context of being presented with proof. Answer is
scrutinizing
Question: The portly man was having lunch, he ate so fast he didn't chew small enough pieces and sure enough began to what? Options: A: choke,B: getting full,C: burp,D: eat food,E: regurgitating,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man ate his lunch quickly and did not chew his food properly, which led to a negative consequence. Choking is a common risk of swallowing large pieces of food without proper mastication, so this is the most logical choice. Getting full, burping, eating food, and regurgitating do not fit with the context of the sentence or contribute to the logical progression of events. Answer is
choke

play music
Question: There was a sign telling picnickers not to feed squirrels, where was this sign likely placed? Options: A: park,B: forest,C: tree,D: roof,E: yard,. Knowledge: The sign is specifically referring to picnickers, suggesting that they are in a public area where people go to have picnics, such as a park. Squirrels can be found in many environments, including forests, trees, roofs, and yards, but the mention of picnickers implies an area specifically designated for recreational activities. Therefore, the correct answer is park. Answer is
park
Question: If someone doesn't enjoy playing baseball what might they call it? Options: A: happiness,B: fun,C: entertainment,D: love,E: stupid,. Knowledge: The sentence is asking about a negative association with baseball, and "stupid" is the only option that suggests a dislike or disdain for the activity. The other options all suggest positive feelings towards baseball, which would not make sense in the context of someone who does not enjoy it. "Fun," "entertainment," and "love" are all positive words that indicate enjoyment, whereas "stupid" is a negative word that suggests a lack of interest or distaste. Answer is
stupid

Answer is

Question: Where does a fox go most of the time? Options: A: back yard,B: hen house,C: storybook,D: natural habitat,E: bathroom,. Knowledge: Foxes are wild animals that typically live in their natural habitat, such as forests, grasslands, and deserts. They may occasionally wander into residential areas like backyards or hen houses in search of food, but these are not their everyday habitats. Storybooks and bathrooms are not places where foxes would typically go, making natural habitat the most likely answer. Answer is
natural habitat
Question: Where do people view more than one rosebush? Options: A: hedgerow,B: temperate climate,C: botanical gardens,D: beehouse,E: backyard,. Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is asking about a place where people go to view multiple rosebushes. While small plantings of roses may be found in some of the other options (such as a backyard or hedgerow), the only option that specifically refers to a location with multiple varieties of plants is a botanical garden. Additionally, botanical gardens often have dedicated rose gardens or sections, making them a likely answer. Answer is
botanical gardens
Question: Where would you store glue when it's not in use? Options: A: desk drawer,B: art room,C: classroom,D: bathroom,E: school,. Knowledge: Glue is a common item used in office and school settings, and it is typically stored in a desk drawer or supply cabinet when not in use. The other options, such as art room or bathroom, may also be places where glue is used, but they are not as common for storage purposes. The context of the question suggests that the answer is related to a common location for storage rather than a specific use case. Answer is
desk drawer
Question: The woman was worried about environmental impact, what did she fret over while attempting to wash clothes? Options: A: pick up,B: use water,C: use soap,D: get dirty,E: gather up,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the woman was concerned about the environmental impact of washing clothes, which suggests that she may have been trying to conserve resources like water.

Knowledge: The word "false stories" suggests that the act of talking to others about them may lead to the spread of rumors. Rumors are often based on untrue or exaggerated information that is passed from person to person through conversation. Adverse reactions, such as disagreement or anger, can be a result of spreading false stories, but it is less likely to be the direct outcome. Teaching, friendship, and increased understanding are not directly related to the act of talking about false stories. Answer is
rumors spread

Knowledge: The word "achromatic" refers to colors that have no hue, such as white, black, and shades of gray.

The other options are not relevant to the context of the question. Answer is
achromatic

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the spirit was leaving the physical body of a human being and transitioning to the afterlife. The options "bar," "cemetery," and "graveyard" do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are locations rather than the thing that the spirit was leaving. "Earth" is too general and could refer to many things, but "human being" directly relates to the context of the sentence. Answer is
human being
Question: While fun for balloons and parties, a helium tank can also be found in what place of research? Options: A: sadistic dentist's office,B: atmosphere,C: laboratory,D: chemistry lab,E: moon,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions a helium tank being used for research, suggesting that the correct answer is related to scientific work. The options "sadistic dentist's office" and "moon" do not seem to fit the context of the sentence. "Atmosphere" is a possibility, but it does not specifically relate to research. "Chemistry lab" and "laboratory" both indicate a scientific purpose, but "chemistry lab" may be too specific and limiting, whereas "laboratory" could encompass various fields of research that may use helium tanks. Therefore, the best choice is "laboratory." Answer is
laboratory

Knowledge: The mention of "shopping bag full of food" suggests that the person went to a place where they purchase groceries in bulk or large quantities.

Answer is
grocery store
Question: What will you do after you are awake? Options: A: open eyes,B: get to sleep,C: deep sleep,D: sleep again,E: conscious,.

open eyes

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker experienced a romantic breakup, which can often result in emotional distress and a feeling of heartbreak. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence – annoyance may be a reaction to the breakup, but does not describe the speaker's emotional state, and hospitalized and schizophrenia are not related to the situation at all. Stress could be a result of the breakup, but the phrasing of the sentence implies that the speaker is specifically referring to the emotional pain of heartbreak. Answer is
broken heart

Question: What would you do to get dirt off of yourself? Options: A: wash clothes,B: wipe off,C: clean clothing,D: bathe,E: clean clothes,. Knowledge: The word "yourself" suggests that the question is asking about personal hygiene. The word "dirt" implies that something is dirty or soiled. The most appropriate action to take to clean oneself thoroughly would be to take a bath, as this would allow the person to wash their entire body.

Question: The crab was being netted of the coast of Louisiana, where was he caught? Options: A: tidepools,B: fishing boat,C: north sea,D: gulf of mexico,E: grocery store,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions that the crab was being netted off the coast of Louisiana, which is a state located on the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore, it is likely that the crab was caught in the Gulf of Mexico. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Tidepools are typically located near rocky shores and would not be a common place to catch crabs, while the North Sea is located in Europe, making it an unlikely location for a crab caught off the coast of Louisiana. A grocery store is a place where people buy food, not where crabs are caught. A fishing boat is a possible location for catching crabs, but the sentence does not provide any direct evidence to support this option. Answer is
gulf of mexico

The phrase "know truth" is a common expression used to describe the pursuit of accurate, verifiable knowledge. The other options, such as "intelligent children" or "wonderful memories", do not directly relate to the concept of factual knowledge.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer was good at raising chickens, but he wasn't ready to move up to something else. The options "rooster" and "hen" are both types of chickens, so they do not fit the context of the sentence. "Bought at store" is also unrelated, as it doesn't refer to any specific animal. "Tuna" is a type of fish, which is also unrelated. "Cow" is a larger animal and would represent a step up in terms of the complexity of the farming operation, making it the correct answer. Answer is
cow
Question: It wasn't something he had had before, but he found the chicken and grape vinaigrette what to be delicious? Options: A: bowl of fruit,B: salad,C: table,D: food store,E: restaurant,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is describing a dish made with chicken and grape vinaigrette dressing. This type of dish is commonly referred to as a salad, which typically includes lettuce or other greens as a base. The other options, such as a bowl of fruit or a table, do not make sense in the context of describing a dish. Food store and restaurant are possible options, but the sentence doesn't give enough information to suggest whether the dish was bought from a store or eaten at a restaurant. Answer is
salad

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is experiencing a physical sensation related to their bladder, which typically indicates a need to urinate. Restrooms are the most common place to relieve oneself in this situation, while the other options do not provide obvious relief or may be inappropriate.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the Mississippi River is the largest in a certain region, which is further specified as North America. This means that the other options, such as wilderness or city, are not likely to be accurate choices since they do not describe a larger region.

Discord, social events, competition, and heightened awareness are not necessarily related to playing poker or the consequences of not being good at it. Answer is
losing money
Question: Where is a special wild rosebush found? Options: A: botanic garden,B: flower garden,C: california,D: courtyard,E: landscaping,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wild rosebush being referred to is a special or unique one, indicating that it may not be commonly found in most locations. The options "botanic garden," "flower garden," and "landscaping" all suggest more controlled and planned environments, making it less likely for a wild rosebush to be found there. "Courtyard" could potentially be a location where a rare wild rosebush is found, but it is not specific enough to be the correct answer. Therefore, "California" is the most likely answer since it is a large state with diverse geography and flora, and could potentially be home to a special wild rosebush. Answer is
california

"Get ideas" is the most logical choice because it suggests that the writer was able to overcome his writer's block and generate new ideas. "Daydream" and "become distracted" are possibilities, but they do not necessarily suggest that the writer was able to solve his problem. "Headache" and "gave up" are clearly not the correct answer, as they are negative outcomes. Answer is
get ideas

The other options do not accurately describe the situation presented in the sentence. "Question" implies that the parties were merely unsure of something, "contradict" suggests that they were actively opposing each other's positions, "deny" implies that one party refused to accept the other's proposal, and "asking" does not make sense in this context.

Knowledge: The question asks for a method that will give a smaller result, which suggests that we need to reduce the size of the number. Adding or multiplying positive integers will always result in a larger number, so we can eliminate those options.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bill did not have extreme feelings of either admiration or disdain for the holy man. The word "revere" means to show deep respect or worship whereas "disdain" means to look down upon or despise. Therefore, it can be inferred that Bill had a moderate level of respect for the holy man, which is the best option among the choices. "Honour" and "admire" both suggest a higher level of admiration than what is described in the sentence, while "thankfulness" is not relevant to the context. Answer is
respect

While it is possible that this could happen in other locations, such as a house or loft, it is more likely to happen in a classroom where students are expected to sit still and listen to a lecture or read quietly for an extended period of time. Temples and most architectural structures may not necessarily be places where students spend a lot of time getting bored. Answer is
classroom
Question: Where are prepared mushrooms purchased? Options: A: refrigerator,B: ground,C: grocery store,D: pizza,E: forest,. Knowledge: The question is asking where prepared mushrooms are purchased, suggesting that they have been processed or packaged in some way. The option "refrigerator" does not specify where the refrigerator is located or what it contains, making it an unlikely choice. "Ground" is nonsensical in this context. "Pizza" refers to a dish that can contain mushrooms, but it does not answer the question of where prepared mushrooms are purchased. "Forest" refers to where mushrooms may grow naturally, but it is not a place where they are typically purchased in a prepared form. "Grocery store" is the most logical choice as it is a common retail location where packaged and processed foods, including prepared mushrooms, can be found. Answer is
grocery store

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the formerly lonely man chatted with friends for a long time. It is likely that he would feel happiness after spending time with friends and enjoying their company. Tiredness may be a possibility, but it is not the most likely option given that the sentence contains no indication that the man was physically or mentally taxed after the conversation. Communication and agreement are too vague to be the answer, and answers is not a fitting option given that it suggests that the man was seeking responses to specific questions, which is not implied in the sentence. Answer is

The desk and office are typically associated with work and may have more functional chairs.

"Fluffy house" is not a common term and does not provide any useful information. Answer is
living room

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy thinks he is intelligent, but his attitudes are regressive, meaning he holds outdated, conservative beliefs. "Backward" means the opposite of progressive, which fits the context of the sentence. "Ignorant" could also fit the context, but it doesn't necessarily convey the idea of conservatism that is implied by "regressive." "Garish" and "annoying" are not related to the context of the sentence, and "intelligent" contradicts the idea that Billy's attitudes are regressive. Answer is
backward
Question: Where do people store cars when running errands? Options: A: at home,B: freeway,C: race track,D: parking lot,E: car show,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that when people are out and about running errands, they need to store their cars somewhere temporarily. While it is possible they may store them at home or a race track, those options are not practical in the given context.

Therefore, the most logical choice is a parking lot, which is a designated space for temporarily storing vehicles. Answer is
parking lot

Options: A: pleistocene,B: museum of natural history,C: smithsonian institution,D: antarctica,E: old times,.

The Pleistocene epoch is a well-known geological time period that lasted from about 2.6 million years ago to 11,700 years ago and is associated with the rise and fall of many extinct animals, including mammoths. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Therefore, if someone needed to find out the hours that a business, such as Marmot, is open, it would be logical to consult the yellow pages.

yellow pages

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the back courtyard is a common feature found in every house in the neighborhood. The options "palace" and "country estate" suggest expensive and luxurious properties, which would not be common features of every house in a neighborhood.

Therefore, "suburbs" is the most likely correct choice as this is a common feature in neighborhoods of this nature. Answer is
suburbs

Options: A: tensions,B: going to court,C: resentment,D: verdict,E: civility,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John and Seth have a problem, and John is taking legal action against Seth. The word "tensions" implies a rising level of conflict between the two parties, which is a likely outcome when one person sues another. The other options do not necessarily fit the context: "going to court" is already stated in the sentence, "resentment" may already exist and not necessarily increasing, "verdict" refers to a legal outcome and not a relationship dynamic, and "civility" is the opposite of tensions and not an appropriate answer in this context. Answer is
tensions
Question: Getting a gift you wanted for you birthday will cause what state? Options: A: disappointment,B: angry,C: then have,D: being happy,E: headaches,. Knowledge: The verb "getting" combined with the noun "gift" suggests that the outcome of receiving a gift will be positive. The phrase "you wanted" reinforces this idea, indicating that the gift is desired and will likely bring joy. The other options, such as disappointment and anger, have negative connotations and do not fit with the context of receiving a desired gift. Headaches is also not a likely outcome of receiving a gift. Answer is

The word "overcast" also implies a lack of sunlight, which would further support the idea that the colors were not as vibrant as they could have been. "Dull" is the most appropriate choice as it accurately describes a loss of brightness or vibrancy, while the other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
dull
Question: Sam treasured his freedom.  When he became a POW, he tried to escape from what? Options: A: communism,B: oppression,C: slavery,D: bad marriage,E: captivity,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sam valued his ability to make his own decisions and do as he pleased, which is a common attribute associated with freedom.

captivity
Question: What do fish have to aid in oxygen exchange? Options: A: gills,B: bones,C: tail,D: no legs,E: see work,. Knowledge: Gills are the organs that enable fish to extract oxygen from water, so they are essential for their survival. Fish are not able to breathe air like land animals, which means that they must have specialized respiratory structures to extract oxygen from their watery environment. Bones, tail, and no legs are physical features of fish, but they are not directly related to oxygen exchange. "See work" is unrelated to the question. Answer is
gills

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker is preparing for guests and has arranged cookies on something. It is common to arrange cookies on a plate when serving them to guests, which makes "plate" the most likely answer. The other options are unlikely because a jar may not be big enough or appropriate for cookies, a house is not a place to set out cookies, a mouth is not something to set out cookies on and a hubcap is not typically used for serving food. Answer is
plate

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Jim talked without pause, which indicates a continuous or uninterrupted pattern of speech. The word "constantly" is the best choice to describe this rate of talking, as it means without stopping or pausing.

Church may offer some educational opportunities, but attending school is a more direct and comprehensive way to learn. Answer is

"Tiredness" is very similar to "get tired" and may also be a suitable answer, but "get tired" is more specific in describing the action that is likely to occur.

One possible reason for taking an unpaid membership is to gain experience in a particular field (e.g. volunteer work). Taking notes and studying books do not necessarily require a membership, and capitalist exploitation does not make sense in this context. "Listen carefully" might be a plausible option, but it is less likely than "gain experience" given the word choice in the sentence. Answer is
gain experience
Question: What might I use if I want to give a grape as a gift? Options: A: kitchen,B: bowl of fruit,C: box,D: field,E: fruit basket,. Knowledge: The question is asking for a suitable container for giving a grape as a gift. Out of the options provided, a fruit basket would be the most appropriate choice for presenting a single grape as a gift. A kitchen or field would not be suitable containers, and a bowl of fruit may be too large or contain other items that could detract from the singular grape as a gift. A box could be an option, but a fruit basket would add a decorative touch to the gift presentation. Answer is
fruit basket
Question: Where would you find an expensive lantern? Options: A: a collector's house,B: dark place,C: house,D: antique shop,E: street,. Knowledge: The word "expensive" suggests that the lantern is valuable and therefore likely to be sold in a location that specializes in selling expensive or rare items. An antique shop fits this description as it typically sells vintage and valuable items. The other options, such as a collector's house or a dark place, do not necessarily imply that the lantern is expensive, and therefore are less likely to be the correct answer. Answer is
antique shop
Question: What would a sick person do to recover? Options: A: take medicine,B: throw up,C: exercise,D: battle cancer,E: get better,. Knowledge: Taking medicine is a common method for treating illnesses and recovering from sickness. On the other hand, throwing up and exercising may not always be recommended or effective methods for recovery. Battling cancer requires a combination of treatments and a longer period of time compared to a regular illness, which makes it an unlikely choice for this question. Finally, "get better" is not a concrete action or method that a sick person can take to actively aid in their recovery. Answer is
take medicine

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the government has a tendency to impose control on various aspects of society or individuals, hence the word "anything." The other options don't fit, as they're either specific places (Washington D.C.) or too general (country and all of us) and don't provide the same level of specificity as "everything." Answer is
everything
Question: What is typical of a person with blemish free, flowing skin? Options: A: finger,B: makeup,C: body,D: own family,E: good health,.

This suggests that there is a designated guest room in the house, and that the sofa bed is a temporary solution for extra guests. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a basement, garage, or hotel would not typically have a sofa bed for guests, and horseradish is not related to the topic at all. Answer is
guest room
Question: How can the shape of wood be changed? Options: A: nailed,B: grind,C: carved,D: polished,E: warp,. Knowledge: The question is asking about how the shape of wood can be changed. Nailing usually does not change the shape of the wood but only attaches it to another piece of wood. Grinding and polishing can shape and smooth the surface of wood, but not its overall shape. Warping refers to the wood bending or twisting due to changes in humidity or temperature. Carving, however, refers to the act of removing pieces of wood to alter its shape, making it the correct answer to the question. Answer is

Knowledge: The context of the sentence mentions that there is an aquarium, which is likely to have fish in it. Since cats are natural predators and often hunt fish in the wild, it is likely that they are looking to eat the fish in the aquarium. The other options like heat, play, drink water, and come to dinner do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
eating fish
Question: Where would you find people sleeping in a chair waiting for a vehicle to arrive? Options: A: airport,B: floor,C: bedroom,D: desk,E: bus station,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are waiting for a vehicle to arrive, which is a common occurrence in airports where people wait for their flights or for someone to pick them up.

Question: What can be the end result of waging war? Options: A: people dying,B: heartache,C: killing people,D: evil,E: suffering,. Knowledge: Waging war often involves violent conflict and the use of weapons, which can result in the death of individuals involved in the fighting. This is a common and well-known consequence of war, whereas heartache, evil, and suffering are more abstract concepts that may be associated with war but do not directly describe a tangible result. Killing people is also a possible consequence of war, but it is more specific than people dying and may not always occur in every war. Answer is
people dying

state facts
Question: Where would I go to see the most brands of oboe? Options: A: orchestra,B: case,C: guitar center,D: band,E: music store,. Knowledge: The question is asking where you can find the most variety of oboe brands, so the most likely place to find a wide selection would be a music store. Orchestras and bands may have oboes, but they would typically only have a few select brands for their players to use. A case is not a location where oboes are sold, and Guitar Center is a store that specializes in guitars and other stringed instruments, so it is less likely to have a large selection of oboes. Answer is
music store
Question: Where would you put a sealed drink if you want to bring it with you? Options: A: cup,B: cabinet,C: cardboard box,D: stumble,E: backpack,. Knowledge: The question suggests that the drink needs to be transported from one location to another, which indicates that it should be placed in a container that can be carried easily. Of the options given, only 'backpack' fits this criteria as it is a type of bag that can be used to carry items. The other options - cup, cabinet, cardboard box, and stumble - do not seem like practical choices for storing a drink during transportation. Answer is
backpack

Knowing that mines are typically associated with extraction of natural resources like coal, oil, and minerals, it is reasonable to eliminate options like ground, cambodia, and mine craft game. Additionally, mountains are often associated with mining activities, but may not necessarily have a lot of mines. Pennsylvania, on the other hand, has a strong history of coal mining, making it a likely answer choice. Answer is
pennsylvania

"Bike path" may suggest a route to take, but does not indicate a specific destination for taking classes. "University" is the best answer because it directly relates to attending classes and is a common location for graduate studies. Answer is
university
Question: The idiots in the front row would not stop banging on the glass, there's always at least one of them at a what?

Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the reason the job was not finished was not due to a lack of effort but rather a lack of something else. The word "enough" suggests that the supplies may have been insufficient to complete the job. "Possessing" does not fit the context of the sentence as it refers to ownership rather than availability. "Plethora" suggests an abundance of supplies, which contradicts the idea that the job was not completed due to a lack of supplies. "Satisfaction" does not fit the context of the sentence as it does not relate to the completion of the job. "Availability" supports the idea that the supplies were not accessible or present, but "enough" is a better fit because it indicates that even if the supplies were available, they were not sufficient to complete the job.

Answer is

The phrase "a little bit of" may indicate that this is something relatively small or subtle.

The phrase "it would help him" implies that the doctor advised the man to eat vegetables for a specific purpose. The option "good for" is too generic and could apply to any number of health benefits associated with vegetables. "Wash" and "starve" do not make sense in this context. "Fibre" could be a possible answer as vegetables are high in fiber, but the doctor's advice seems more geared towards weight loss. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a fundamental difference between the actions of the living and the dead, and that this difference is important. The options "talk", "sometimes bad", "pollution", and "happiness" do not seem to fit this context. "Have experiences" is the most logical answer, as it is something that only the living can do. The dead cannot have any new experiences, as they are no longer alive. Answer is
have experiences
Question: A virus causes the flu and the common what? Options: A: cold,B: disease,C: infection,D: mutate,E: make person sick,. Knowledge: The sentence states that a virus causes the flu and the common "what." The word "what" indicates that we are looking for a noun that is commonly associated with the flu virus. The options "disease" and "infection" could be correct, but they are too general and don't specifically relate to the flu. The option "make person sick" is too broad and does nothing to help us identify a specific word. The correct answer is "cold," because the flu and the common cold are both respiratory illnesses caused by viruses. Answer is
cold

Knowledge: The context of the sentence is referring to fitting one piece with another, which is a common action in a jigsaw puzzle.

jigsaw puzzle

Knowledge: The question specifies that the person is a woman and wants to bring a writing instrument with her. This suggests that the writing instrument needs to be portable and easily carried around. The most common place for women to carry small items like pens or pencils is in their purse. The other options do not make sense in this context: a stationery store is a place to buy writing instruments, not store them; a ball stopped is not a place to store things; a pocket may be an option for some women's clothing, but it's not universal; and a classroom is a location, not a storage option. Answer is
purse

cup water

Knowledge: In pioneer times, salt was commonly used for food preservation. It helps to prevent bacteria growth and can extend the lifespan of certain foods.

Baking soda and water might be used for other purposes but are not typically used in food preservation. Answer is
salt

transportation
Question: Where is the best place to make food? Options: A: kitchen,B: supermarket,C: table,D: stomach,E: restaurant,. Knowledge: The question is asking for the best place to make food, which implies that the food is being prepared from scratch rather than being purchased ready-made. The most logical place for this to occur is in a kitchen, which is designed specifically for cooking and food preparation. The other options are unlikely to be the best place to make food - supermarkets are for shopping, tables are for eating, and stomachs are for digesting. While restaurants do have kitchens, they are not necessarily the best place for individuals to make their own food. Answer is
kitchen
Question: She had trouble remembering her happy wedding day, but when she did, what did she experience? Options: A: hunger,B: knowing,C: depression,D: knowledge,E: pleasure,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the woman had difficulty recalling her wedding day, but when she did remember it, she experienced a particular emotion. The details provided do not provide any direct hints as to what that emotion might be, but given the context of a happy wedding day, it is reasonable to assume that the emotion would be positive. The option "pleasure" best fits this assumption, as it suggests a joyous or satisfying feeling. The other options ("hunger," "knowing," "depression," and "knowledge") do not seem to fit the context of the sentence or the general tone of a happy wedding day. Answer is
pleasure
Question: What did Van Gogh feel when he found his long lost painting? Options: A: new look,B: physical work,C: new color,D: great relief,E: slashes,. Knowledge: The phrase "long lost" implies that the painting was missing for a significant amount of time, and the fact that Van Gogh "felt" something suggests an emotional response to its discovery.

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or the emotion it conveys. Answer is
great relief

water garden

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is at a residential location and needs to borrow a common household item such as sugar. The most likely place to find this item would be at a neighbor's house rather than an office, theater, gas station, or wall. Additionally, the use of the word "chuckled" implies that the person knows the neighbor well enough to find the situation somewhat humorous, further supporting the idea that they are borrowing sugar from a nearby neighbor. Answer is
neighbor's house
Question: Where can a human find body coverings? Options: A: phone booth,B: clothing store,C: workplace,D: swimming pool,E: closets,. Knowledge: The term "body coverings" suggests an item of clothing, which can be found at a clothing store. A phone booth is unlikely to have body coverings, and a workplace or swimming pool may have uniforms or specific clothing requirements, but these would not be referred to as "body coverings." Closets typically contain clothing, but the question is asking where a human can find body coverings, rather than where they might store them. Answer is
clothing store

"Hang out" is a common phrase used to describe this type of social activity.

Answer is
hang out

love another
Question: What is usually a beautiful sound? Options: A: concert hall,B: chainsaw,C: movie,D: mouth,E: music,. Knowledge: The question is asking for something that is typically considered beautiful to hear. The word "usually" suggests that there may be exceptions, but in general, the answer will be something that is pleasing to the ears. The option "concert hall" could be a possible answer if the question specified that the context was related to experiencing music live. However, the other options are unlikely to be considered beautiful sounds, with "chainsaw" and "movie" being particularly jarring and unpleasant. "Mouth" could possibly be a correct answer if the context was specified, such as beautiful singing or speaking, but without any additional information it is too broad. Answer is
music
Question: If the though of performing makes you anxious what do you suffer from? Options: A: being appreciated,B: get attention,C: terror,D: stage fright,E: fear,.

Knowledge: The sentence implies that young people are getting lessons, which suggests an educational setting like a classroom. The dictionary is likely nearby to provide support for the students' learning. The other options, like a friend's house or a shelf, do not suggest an educational context.

classroom
Question: Susan was a mean person. But even so, she could show what? Options: A: mean cruel,B: friendly,C: kindness,D: nice,E: generous,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Susan had a negative personality trait, but despite that, she was capable of displaying a positive one. The choices "mean cruel" and "nice" are both synonyms for each other, and do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Friendly" may suggest a different aspect of Susan's personality that is not relevant to the sentence, while "generous" is not necessarily associated with displaying positive behavior towards others. "Kindness" is the best option as it represents a positive personality trait that contrasts with Susan's known negative trait. Answer is
kindness
Question: Where could you find a bed that has been used by many people? Options: A: mattress store,B: rest area,C: hotel room,D: apartment,E: loft,.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Additionally, the fact that James was frustrated and couldn't get a replacement suggests that the ticket was necessary for his return travel, which reinforces the idea that he missed his flight. Answer is

Question: If something's weight isn't light, what is it? Options: A: crucial,B: darkness,C: cumbersome,D: heavy,E: darkness,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the opposite of "light" in this context is a word that describes something having a considerable weight. "Crucial" and "darkness" do not relate to weight in any way, and "cumbersome" implies that the object is difficult to handle or move, but not necessarily heavy. Therefore, "heavy" is the most appropriate choice. Answer is
heavy
Question: Where can you buy an electric fan? Options: A: sauna,B: home,C: closet,D: hardware store,E: computer,. Knowledge: The question is asking where to buy an electric fan, which is an appliance commonly found in homes and used to cool down a space.

hardware store

A building or coffee shop may have tables, but the question specifically asks about something that can be put next to a chair. Therefore, the best answer is table. Answer is
table

Options: A: great outdoors,B: mountainous region,C: north america,D: los angeles,E: sierra nevada mountains,. Knowledge: Marmots are typically found in mountainous regions, and the Sierra Nevada mountains are a well-known mountain range in California. While California is in North America, this answer is not specific enough since marmots can be found in other mountainous regions throughout North America. Similarly, the Great Outdoors is a vague and broad term that could refer to any natural environment. Los Angeles is a city and not known for its wildlife, making it an unlikely choice. Answer is
sierra nevada mountains
Question: If I lived in a small village outside a city, which general geographic area would this be? Options: A: africa,B: countryside,C: the mountains,D: south american country,E: ohio,. Knowledge: The sentence describes living in a small village outside of a city, which suggests a rural setting. Rural settings are often characterized by open spaces, natural landscapes, and less densely populated areas.

Knowledge: A post office is a physical location where mail is sorted, processed, and distributed. It is usually located in a building specifically designed for this purpose, which may be in the center of a town or city, in a business district or other area where there is high foot traffic. Deliveries are not typically made from a post office location, so that choice can be eliminated. While a post office may be located in the center of town or city, it could just as easily be located in another part of the area, so those options are not specific enough to be correct. Answer is
building
Question: Where do you bring your flight bag? Options: A: aircraft,B: aeroplane,C: airplane,D: airport,E: on you lap,. Knowledge: A flight bag is typically brought to an airport, as it contains items necessary for travel such as passport, boarding pass, and any personal items that are not carried in a larger suitcase. The other options, aircraft, aeroplane, and airplane, refer to the vehicle used for air travel rather than the location where the flight bag is to be brought. "On your lap" is not a suitable answer because it does not make sense in the context of the question. Answer is
airport

Question: While attending a lecture what should be done in the auditorium? Options: A: take notes,B: listening,C: fall asleep,D: falling asleep,E: learning,. Knowledge: Attending a lecture typically requires active listening and note-taking in order to absorb and retain information. Falling asleep during a lecture would not be a productive use of time, and "learning" is too broad of an answer as it encompasses any method of acquiring knowledge. "Falling asleep" and "falling asleep" are redundant options, and the correct answer "take notes" aligns with best practices for effective learning during a lecture. Answer is
take notes
Question: He was running from the assailant, what is his purpose for running? Options: A: accidents,B: moving fast,C: injuries,D: shortness of breath,E: exercise,.

Flatulence, chair and comfort are not related to the physical stability of the object, while the option to "sit on" is redundant with the context of the sentence. Answer is
legs
Question: What is necessary for bathing? Options: A: suntan lotion,B: reading newspaper,C: using soap,D: cleanliness,E: slip and fall,.

Question: Where are trees likely to be protected? Options: A: orchard,B: at the tree store.,C: countryside,D: forest,E: state park,. Knowledge: State parks often have strict regulations in place to protect natural resources such as trees, wildlife, and water sources. Therefore, trees are more likely to be protected in a state park compared to other options such as a tree store or orchard where trees may be grown for commercial purposes and may not be as strictly regulated. Forests and countryside areas may have some protection, but it is typically not as strict as in a state park. Answer is
state park

whisper
Question: who uses a contraceptive device? Options: A: pharmacy,B: bedroom,C: person,D: men,E: drug store,. Knowledge: A contraceptive device is a method or tool used by a person to prevent pregnancy. Therefore, the correct answer must refer to an individual or group of individuals who use such devices. The options "pharmacy" and "drug store" may sell contraceptive devices, but they do not use them. The option "bedroom" only refers to a location where a person might use a contraceptive device, not who uses it. The option "men" is too specific and excludes individuals who do not identify as male but still use contraceptive devices. Therefore, the only correct and inclusive option is "person". Answer is
person

One of the most well-known negative effects of driving a car is that it contributes to pollution, specifically air pollution from exhaust fumes.

Answer is
pollution
Question: The man looked longingly at the seats after hours on the road, where was he? Options: A: rest area,B: show,C: bowling alley,D: space shuttle,E: doctors office,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man had been traveling for a long period of time, which is a common reason for people to stop and take a break at a rest area. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence. A show or bowling alley would not typically be located near a road or be associated with travel. The mention of a space shuttle or doctor's office seems out of place and does not match the tone or setting described in the sentence. Answer is
rest area

The other options, such as a dressing room or hotel room, may also have mirrors available, but they are less common or not as convenient for everyday use. The toilet and house are too general and do not specifically refer to a place where one would typically get dressed or check their appearance. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is trying to find out the arrival time of the bus, and the most logical thing to do in this situation is to consult the station schedule. Therefore, the correct answer is to "read text." The other options do not make sense in this context. "Cross street" and "throw away" are irrelevant and would not help the person find the arrival time. "Enjoy learning" and "play dumb" are also unlikely to be relevant, as the situation described appears to be one where the person is simply trying to find information quickly and efficiently. Answer is

Question: What will criminals do before robbing a bank? Options: A: step lightly,B: serving time,C: take money,D: arm themselves,E: manual,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the question is about the actions that precede a bank robbery. It is common for criminals to prepare themselves beforehand by arming themselves, increasing their chances of success and reducing the risk of getting caught. "Step lightly" and "manual" do not make sense in this context, and "serving time" suggests that the criminals have already been caught and convicted, which is not relevant to the question at hand. "Take money" is a possible option, but it is too vague and does not specifically address the preparation aspect of the question. Answer is
arm themselves
Question: What destination is a sailor typically most excited for? Options: A: sail boat,B: ship out,C: dinner,D: coming home,E: board ship,.

Learning and engagement may contribute to trust, but they are not directly related to persuading someone to do what you want. Friendship may improve trust, but it does not necessarily involve persuasion. Answer is

The other options do not fit with the negative connotation of the sentence. "Belittle" and "contemn" also convey negative attitudes, but they do not specifically relate to a track or musical composition. "Kind" and "being rude" are antonyms and have positive and negative connotations respectively, which do not fit with the context of the sentence. Answer is
diss

Knowledge: The sentence compares a selfish action (not sharing a sandwich with a hungry friend) to an action that indicates the opposite trait. Therefore, the correct answer must be a word that describes someone who would willingly share their sandwich with a friend in need. Options like philanthropic imply a larger scale of giving, while not hungry is not relevant to the context. Unselfish and altruistic are synonyms for the word selfless, which means putting the needs of others before your own. Therefore, selfless is the most appropriate answer. Answer is
selfless

sweating

Answer is
wear hats

Knowledge: A supply closet is a place where materials and equipment are stored, typically in a workplace or school setting. It is unlikely to be located in a bedroom or a coat closet, as those are typically used for personal belongings. A mop and bucket closet would be a more specific term for a supply closet in a cleaning area. "House" is too general and does not specify a specific room or location. Answer is
school
Question: What is someone doing to the other party when hurting someone else? Options: A: causing pain,B: seek revenge,C: hurt feelings,D: relieve,E: sadness,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that one person is intentionally causing harm to another person. "Causing pain" is the most direct and accurate answer that fits the context of the sentence. "Seeking revenge" may imply that the person being hurt had previously harmed the other person, which is not mentioned in the sentence. "Hurt feelings" and "sadness" are emotions that may be experienced as a result of being hurt, but do not directly answer the question of what the person is doing.

causing pain
Question: What can occur in fencing when it is really hot? Options: A: puncture wound,B: drinking,C: perspiration,D: severe injuries,E: competition,.

A warehouse would be the most suitable option as it is specifically designed for storing large amounts of goods.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while terrorism may be caused by a few individuals, it can have far-reaching consequences. The use of the phrase "all out" implies that the consequences are significant and widespread, beyond just the immediate effects of terrorism such as detonating bombs. Of the options given, war is the most logical choice as it involves large-scale conflicts and is often a result of terrorism that is not effectively addressed or resolved. The other options do not fully capture the breadth and severity of the consequences suggested by the sentence. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the wristwatch is valuable and needs to be stored safely. The options "jewelry box", "dresser" and "hock" do not provide enough protection for an expensive wristwatch. "Jewelry store" is not a likely option for someone to keep their own wristwatch, as it is typically a retail store. "Case" is the most appropriate choice, as it is a secure and protective storage option for a valuable item like a wristwatch. Answer is
case
Question: The main part of turkey makes up what? Options: A: ocean,B: middle east,C: balkan peninsula,D: turkeycock,E: asia minor,. Knowledge: In this question, the phrase "main part of turkey" refers to a geographical location, which narrows down the possible answers to the ones that refer to geography rather than animals or bodies of water. The term "middle east" could be a possible answer, as Turkey is located in the region commonly referred to as the Middle East, but the more specific and accurate answer is "asia minor." Asia Minor is the peninsula on which Turkey is situated, and it is a commonly used term to describe this region. The Balkan Peninsula is not related to Turkey, and "turkeycock" is a non-existent word that does not make any sense in the context of the question. Answer is
asia minor

Knowledge: The question asks what someone might be starting a fire to achieve, indicating that the person has a purpose for starting the fire. The option "warmth" is the most logical choice as starting a fire can provide warmth and is a common reason for starting fires in camping, outdoor activities or even in homes during the winter season. The options "burns", "going to jail", and "haircut" do not have a clear connection to starting a fire. Also, "going to jail" is repeated in the options which indicates that it is most likely not the correct answer. Answer is
warmth
Question: If something is going to die what is likely to happen first? Options: A: being sick,B: stop living,C: stop breathing,D: stop moving,E: go to heaven,. Knowledge: When living beings die, their breathing usually stops first. This happens because breathing is controlled by the respiratory system, which depends on the heart to pump oxygen-rich blood to the lungs. When the heart stops beating, there is no more oxygen to fuel the respiratory system, and breathing stops. The other options are not necessarily true for all cases of dying, and therefore are less likely to be the correct answer. Answer is
stop breathing
Question: Samantha was a person, but she wasn't comfortable with others.  She'd rather spend her time with what? Options: A: headache,B: animal,C: many people,D: put together,E: own house,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Samantha prefers to spend her time with something other than people, and the option "animal" is the only choice that is not related to people. The other options ("headache," "many people," "put together," and "own house") all relate to people, objects, or concepts that are directly or indirectly associated with people. Additionally, the notion that Samantha is uncomfortable around others further supports the idea that she would prefer the company of something other than people, like an animal. Answer is

office

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
indoor plumbing
Question: What kind of breathing makes noise but does not indicate that you are sick? Options: A: sigh,B: clavicular,C: yawn,D: cough,E: live,. Knowledge: The sentence states that the breathing makes noise but does not indicate that the person is sick. A sigh is a deep and audible exhale often used to indicate tiredness, disappointment, or relief, but it is not a symptom of illness. The other options, such as coughing or clavicular breathing (breathing with the upper chest only), are associated with respiratory problems or health issues, making them incorrect choices. Yawning is a normal reflex that can be noisy, but it is not associated with sickness or health problems. "Live" is not a type of breathing. Answer is
sigh

This is closely related to the concept of skill, which is a measure of a person's proficiency or competence in a certain activity.

Answer is
skill

A repair shop may also be a possible location for tools, but this would be a more specialized setting, and there is no contextual reference to suggest that this is the case. A drawer is too small a space and the neighbor's house and dentist have no connection to the idea of storing tools. Answer is
garage
Question: After the yoga class everybody was instructed to sit quietly and do what? Options: A: sit down,B: meditate,C: alone,D: shut up,E: go home,. Knowledge: The sentence states that after the yoga class, everyone was instructed to sit quietly. Meditation is a common practice in yoga and is often done as a way to relax and calm the mind. Therefore, it makes sense that the correct answer is "meditate."

Answer is
meditate

Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the ranch house is a common type of architecture in a particular state located in the northwestern Rocky Mountains. Montana is a state known for its vast expanses of open land, cattle ranches, and rural communities, making it a likely candidate for the answer. British Columbia is a province in Canada and is not located in the United States. California is located on the West Coast but does not fall within the northwestern Rocky Mountains. The term "desert" does not provide enough context to make an informed choice. Answer is

Question: Where is a good place to obtain a ladder? Options: A: apple orchard,B: backyard,C: hardware store,D: garage,E: roof,. Knowledge: The other options do not make sense in the context of obtaining a ladder. An apple orchard and backyard would not have ladders readily available for purchase or loan. A garage may have a ladder, but it's not a given, and it's not a place to go to specifically obtain a ladder. A roof is a dangerous place to climb without proper equipment and training, and it's not a place to go to obtain a ladder. A hardware store, on the other hand, is a common place to purchase or rent ladders for home projects. Answer is

Question: Where are  people likely to push a religious tract? Options: A: public place,B: airport,C: church's track rack,D: laundromat,E: stage,.

While it's possible to see someone pushing a religious tract in any of the listed locations, the most common place would be in a public place such as a park or busy street corner where there are a lot of people. Pushing religious tracts in places like airports or churches may be seen as more targeted or intentional, while pushing them in a laundromat or on a stage may not be as effective in reaching a large audience. Answer is
public place

Knowledge: A sideboard is a piece of furniture that is commonly used to store and display serving dishes, particularly in dining rooms. The other options, such as kitchen or bathroom, are unlikely places where one would find a sideboard filled with serving dishes.

dining room
Question: Studying for taking final exams can be nerve wracking, especially if you're afraid of what? Options: A: success,B: graduation,C: failure,D: anxiety,E: studying,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that studying for final exams is a stressful experience, and specifically mentions being afraid of something. The context implies that the fear is related to the outcome of the exams, which suggests that the correct answer is failure.

One common outcome of answering questions correctly is an improvement in one's grade or overall academic performance. The other options, such as embarrassment or failure, are negative outcomes that are not typically associated with successfully answering questions in an academic setting. Additionally, the option "children will learn" is not a specific outcome related to the individual answering the questions, but rather a goal or result more broadly associated with the process of education. Finally, "discussion" may be a positive outcome of answering questions, but it does not directly address the question of what answering questions correctly leads to. Answer is
better grade

A desk drawer is a logical place to store glue in an office or classroom setting, and is likely the most common option among the choices given.

Question: Houses require a study what to be built on? Options: A: very large,B: pornography,C: foundation,D: walls,E: hole,. Knowledge: The word "require" suggests that this is a necessary component in the construction of houses. A foundation is a crucial component of any building, as it provides stability and support. The other options do not make sense in this context - "very large" and "pornography" are not relevant to the construction of houses, "walls" are built on the foundation, not the other way around, and "hole" is too vague and does not suggest any kind of construction. Answer is
foundation
Question: The master control for ones electricity is usually where? Options: A: big factory,B: helm of ship,C: main office,D: basement,E: center,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location being referred to is a place where one can control their own electricity. This is commonly found in homes and buildings, which typically have a basement where the electrical panel or master control is located. The other options do not make sense in this context; a big factory, helm of ship, or main office would likely have a more complex electrical system that would require a different type of control, while "center" is too vague without additional information. Answer is
basement

Options: A: first turn on power,B: buy one first,C: plug in,D: kill,E: switch on,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the senator was making excuses for someone's potentially violent behavior and trying to blame media (video games and television) for it. The correct answer must be a word that completes the sentence in a logical and appropriate way, given the context. "Kill" is the only option that makes sense in this context – the senator is trying to excuse violence, which is often associated with killing, and is suggesting that media cannot make someone violent enough to kill. The other options (such as "plug in" or "switch on") do not fit the context or make sense logically in this sentence. Answer is
kill

While it's possible for some people to store their drill in a basement or repair shop, these locations are less likely as they are not as convenient as a garage which is often located near the entrance of the house or apartment. Additionally, storing a drill in a bathroom or dentist office does not make sense as these places are not typically associated with home improvement or repairs. Answer is

Question: What would happen if you want to win a game? Options: A: competitiveness,B: satisfaction,C: learning,D: injuries,E: play,.

Play is a generic term that does not provide any specific information about winning a game. Answer is
competitiveness

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location of the gazelle can be found in a zoo that is reminiscent of Disneyland. Since the question also specifies that the location is in an eastern continent, we can eliminate Australia and Ivory Coast as potential options. Wildlife refuge and open plain are not specific enough locations to suggest where this Disneyland-like zoo may be located. This leaves us with Asia as the correct answer, as it is a large continent known for its diverse range of animal habitats and also home to popular theme parks such as Tokyo Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland. Answer is
asia

"Encyclopedia" and "breakfast" are unrelated to the context of the question, while "Ivory Coast" is a specific area in Africa that may or may not have gazelles. "Asia" is a large continent and it is unclear if gazelles inhabit any areas within it. Answer is
open plain

The options "pantry," "office," and "desk drawer" are not relevant to the task and do not provide a solution.

Options: A: gain ground,B: near finish line,C: win the race,D: get tired,E: trip over,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the runner's bad shoelaces caused him to lose the race, which implies that they may have caused him to stumble or trip. This makes "trip over" the most likely answer. The other options (e.g. gain ground, win the race) are unlikely given that the sentence clearly states that the runner lost, and it is not clear how bad shoelaces would help the runner near the finish line. The option "get tired" is also unlikely, as the sentence does not suggest that the runner was physically exhausted, but rather that his shoelaces were the issue. Answer is
trip over

Knowledge: The sentence implies that whatever you do, it requires effort and something else. "Make progress" and "make peace" do not necessarily require effort, whereas "make war" has a negative connotation that doesn't fit the context. "Kindness" is not connected to the idea of making an effort.

The options "loft," "house," and "kitchen" are not stores, so they cannot be the correct answer. The option "bundle" does not make sense in the context of remodeling or shopping for flooring. "Home Depot" is a well-known home improvement store that commonly sells flooring and other remodeling supplies, making it the most likely option. Answer is
home depot

Options: A: restaurant,B: attic,C: fridge,D: ocean,E: universe,. Knowledge: The description of Billy stumbling about in a dark place and a rolled up map of stars suggest that he is likely in an attic, where people often store items that are not used frequently, such as the map of stars. The creaky floor also points to the possibility of being in an attic, as the wood is often old and may make noise when someone walks on it. The other options are not related to the context and do not make sense with the description provided. Answer is
attic
Question: What can help a lemur to see? Options: A: sunshine,B: moon,C: dictionary,D: rain forest,E: wilderness,. Knowledge: Lemurs are diurnal animals, meaning they are active during the day and asleep at night. Therefore, it is likely that they rely on sunshine to see, as it provides the necessary light for them to navigate their surroundings. The moon and rain forest would not necessarily provide enough light for a lemur to see clearly. A dictionary has no connection to a lemur's ability to see, and wilderness is too broad of an option to be specific to this question. Answer is
sunshine
Question: People have to eat and drink, breathing is also a key factor in what? Options: A: living,B: warm air,C: hyperventilation,D: relaxation,E: oxygen,.

Question: He cried when seeing the bill, what did he feel? Options: A: wipe eyes,B: miserable,C: distraught,D: shed tears,E: were sad,. Knowledge: The word "cried" suggests a strong emotional response, and the phrase "when seeing the bill" implies that the emotion was triggered by something related to money. The word "distraught" means extremely upset or overwhelmed by emotions, so this would be the most fitting choice. "Wipe eyes" and "shed tears" are more specific actions that don't capture the intensity of the emotion, while "miserable" and "sad" are too general and don't convey the specific feeling of being overwhelmed by emotions. Answer is
distraught

The other options may not provide suitable hiding places for a snake or may not be as common habitats for snakes. Answer is
underbrush

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the building goes through a regular occurrence that can happen every day, which narrows down the choices to "it gets dark" and "casts shadow". The phrase "around half of the time" implies that the occurrence happens during a specific time of day (i.e. when the sun is at a certain angle).

A suitcase and portfolio are designed for travel and transportation, so they would not be a practical storage solution. Answer is
cabinet

Hearing testimony is a common practice in court where witnesses or experts are called to provide sworn statements of their knowledge or observations related to the case.

hear testimony

The phrase "on the other hand" further emphasizes this contrast.

Knowledge: The sentence implies that theaters have a common location, and the context suggests that this location is likely to be in a city or urban area. The choice "shopping mall" is unlikely, as theaters are not often found within shopping malls. "In buildings" is too vague, as many different types of buildings could house theaters. "New York City" may be a valid option, but the phrase "typically located" suggests that the answer should apply to theaters in general, not just those in one specific city. "Populated area" is also vague and could apply to many different types of locations. Therefore, "downtown area" is the most appropriate choice, as many theaters are often found in the downtown areas of cities. Answer is

Therefore, "managed" is the most logical choice among the given options. "Recur" means to happen again or repeatedly, which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. "Cause irrational behavior" and "cause hallucination" are both negative outcomes of mental illness, and it doesn't align with the idea that the individual was able to handle it to some extent. "Effectively treated" is a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily align with the idea that she still had mental illness her whole life. Answer is

"Laughter" is often a byproduct of spending time with friends, but it is not the primary reason. "Gathering of information" is also unlikely to be the reason since it suggests a more formal or professional setting. Instead, the most likely reason is to feel closer to their friends, which is a common motivation for socializing with others.

Therefore, the correct answer is "movie theatre," where people usually watch movies in a quiet and respectful environment. Answer is
movie theatre

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the action being described is related to leaf removal or disposal. The word "rake" implies that the leaves are being gathered and moved intentionally. The options "forest," "floral arrangement," and "basement" do not make sense in this context.

compost pile

The term "company" is commonly used to describe a military unit consisting of 80-250 individuals, which matches the context of the sentence.

However, "play chess" is a two-player game that requires both players to participate and can be a fun and engaging activity for children to do together. Answer is
play chess

"Westerly" is an adjective that describes something that is located in or moving toward the west, and "eastside" refers to a particular location within a larger area. Therefore, "western" is the only option that specifically refers to someone who is not from the east, as it refers to people or things from the western direction. Answer is

Answer is

The options "new york," "strip mall," "big cities," and "center of town" are all specific locations within a country or city, whereas "america" refers to an entire country.

In order to acquire something from a store legally and ethically, one must purchase it by paying for it with money. Stealing is obviously not a correct answer as it is illegal and unethical.

"Reach for" implies physical action, but does not necessarily result in obtaining the desired item from the store. Answer is
purchase
Question: Some celebrities find going public useful after being caught at what? Options: A: high heel shoes,B: getting high,C: problems,D: press coverage,E: wide acceptance,. Knowledge: The phrase "being caught" suggests that the celebrities in question did something they weren't supposed to do, and the word "useful" implies that going public helped them in some way. "High heel shoes" and "wide acceptance" don't seem relevant to the context of being caught, while "problems" is too vague.

getting high
Question: What do people who are having fun in a big way experience? Options: A: stress relief,B: glee,C: injuries,D: hunger,E: may laugh,.

increase

Growing tall is a common adaptation among trees in this situation, as it allows them to reach above other trees and foliage to get access to sunlight. None of the other choices make as much sense in this context - burning, walling in or being covered in snow would all be detrimental to the trees, while growing in soil is a given for any plant. Answer is
grow tall

Horses are an integral part of Western culture, and the region is known for its vast open spaces and rugged terrain, making it a natural setting for these movies. While other regions, such as Canada or England, may have horses and movies set in the past, they are not typically associated with the cowboy and Indians genre. The Triple Crown and Kentucky Derby are both horse races, but they do not relate to the context of cowboy and Indians movies. Answer is

The other options are less relevant to the context of the sentence, as they do not have any clear connection to washing clothes. Answer is

However, the word "never" in the sentence indicates that James may never have had a chance to experience something that would have made learning French easier. Exposure to a language means having contact with it, such as hearing it spoken or reading it in context, and is a crucial factor in language acquisition. The other choices do not fit as well because they all imply some degree of action or intention on James' part, which conflicts with the idea that he never had a particular experience. Answer is

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as a porch and formal seating are more specific areas within a home, a friend's house is not part of the living room, and an apartment could also have a living room but may not have the same connotations of family life. Answer is

The most likely option in the given choices is "stores" as it specifically refers to businesses. "People" is too general and could refer to customers, employees, or potential investors. "Most peculiar places" is an odd option that doesn't fit the context of the sentence. "Mall" is synonymous with shopping center and doesn't provide any additional information.

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well: a supermarket is a large store, a plastic bag would not be referred to as a "walk-in," a toaster is an appliance for cooking food rather than storing it, and a house is too general to provide a clear answer in this context.

Clinics are often associated with longer wait times and take walk-ins without appointments, unlike private doctors who often require appointments and may have shorter wait times.

The options "legs" and "arm" may have hair, but this is not a characteristic commonly associated with those body parts. "Sink" is not a location for hair, but rather a place where hair might be removed or disposed of. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking for a place to eat BBQ that is not at home. The options "backyard" and "neighbor's house" would not be suitable because they are both places where someone would typically have a BBQ meal at home. "Louisiana" is a state known for its BBQ, but it does not provide information on where to get a BBQ meal away from home.

University education can provide knowledge, but it is ultimately up to the individual to store it in their head. A safe is only useful for storing physical items, not intangible knowledge. Answer is

Question: You go into a building.  There were two guards at the entryway checking IDs.  Where might you be.

While it is possible that some high-end department stores may have security measures in place, this would be less common than in buildings and facilities where access control is a higher priority. The option about picking tomatoes from a garden is also unlikely since this activity would not typically require ID checks or security personnel. Answer is
office building

While some of the other options may be activities that the staff could do, they do not fit with the context of the sentence. "Ocean," "studying," and "stay home" are too vague and have no clear connection to the sentence. "Celebrating birthday" may be an option, but it would not make sense for the staff to attend this before the party. Therefore, "meeting" is the most likely answer as it fits with the idea of needing to attend to a task before the party. Answer is

In this context, the Garden of Eden is a reference to the biblical story of Adam and Eve, where a serpent tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, leading to their expulsion from the garden.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are on vacation and have access to a swimming pool that they can enjoy before bedtime. While it is possible to find swimming pools in other locations, such as fitness centers and schools, the context of the sentence implies that the swimming pool is located in a place where people stay during their holiday. A motel is a type of lodging commonly associated with vacation travelers and is therefore the best answer choice. California is a state and not a specific location, and "on the street" does not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
motel

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a modern farmer needs to possess business skills in order to manage finances and increase sales.

Knowledge: The question is asking for a way to wet a washcloth without squatting down, implying that the person does not want to use a lower surface like a bathtub or floor. The kitchen is not necessarily a bad option, but it does not provide a specific solution to the problem. The linen closet and swimming pool are not related to the context of the question at all. This leaves the sink as the most likely and logical option for wetting a washcloth while standing upright. Answer is
sink
Question: When you decide to go somewhere, why do you do it? Options: A: might drive car,B: stumbling down,C: boredom,D: get somewhere,E: have fun,. Knowledge: The question is asking about the reason why someone would decide to go somewhere. Of the given options, "get somewhere" is the most reasonable answer as it directly answers the question. "Might drive car" is incomplete and doesn't provide a clear reason for deciding to go somewhere. "Stumbling down" and "boredom" are unlikely reasons for making a deliberate decision to go somewhere. "Have fun" could be a reason to go somewhere, but it is not general enough to be considered the correct answer. Answer is
get somewhere

Knowledge: When meeting people for the first time, it is customary to introduce yourself, providing your name and perhaps some basic information about who you are and what you do.

However, smiling and saying a greeting are not sufficient on their own and may be perceived as insincere or awkward. Looking over could also be interpreted as rude or dismissive. Answer is
introduce yourself

Question: If the characters are wearing hats and in a dime store what are you likely watching? Options: A: advertisement,B: old movie,C: small neighborhood,D: commercial building,E: strip mall,. Knowledge: The use of the phrase "dime store" suggests that the context is from a bygone era when such stores were more common. Additionally, the fact that the characters are wearing hats implies that the movie is set in a time period when hats were more commonly worn. Therefore, the most likely option is an old movie, which would have been filmed in a time when dime stores were still prevalent and hats were a common fashion accessory. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
old movie
Question: Why do manufacturers have many machines? Options: A: turn jars,B: perform work,C: produce products,D: answering questions,E: serve humanity,.

Knowledge: The sentence implies that going to the opera would be uncomfortable due to a painful condition. The option "fall asleep" doesn't fit because falling asleep would not necessarily be painful. "Haircut" and "fresh" don't make sense in this context. "Relaxation" is the opposite of discomfort. Therefore, "headache" is the only option that connects with the idea of pain and would make going to the opera uncomfortable. Answer is
headache
Question: I have some liquid food that I want to store, where would I put it? Options: A: jar,B: supermarket,C: oven,D: plate,E: pantry,.

Tide pools are shallow, rocky pools filled with seawater that are home to many different sea creatures, including crabs.

pocket

"Walking" could be considered a possible answer, but it is more general and does not necessarily imply a specific purpose or motivation behind the activity. "Becoming tired" and "fatigue" are not reasons for hiking, but rather potential outcomes or challenges that may need to be overcome during the hike. Answer is

The phrase "feel" implies an emotional response, and the options include different emotions that could be associated with this situation. "Let down" is the most appropriate answer as it indicates a feeling of disappointment or disillusionment when expectations are not met. The other options are unlikely to be associated with this situation - illness, for example, is a physical state rather than an emotion, while satisfaction and gratitude would not be appropriate responses to not getting a job offer. Fear also does not fit because there is no indication of what the person is afraid of. Answer is
let down

Question: What was the reaction when the children were given ice cream? Options: A: awesome,B: enjoyed,C: play chess,D: skip,E: sadness,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children had a positive reaction to being given ice cream, since the word "enjoyed" implies a sense of pleasure or satisfaction. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence - "awesome" could be a possible answer if the sentence was describing someone's reaction to hearing about the ice cream, but it doesn't make sense as a response to actually receiving it. "Play chess" and "skip" are unrelated and have no relevance to the sentence. "Sadness" is the opposite of what one would expect in response to being given ice cream. Answer is
enjoyed
Question: Where might I find air to fill up these balloons? Options: A: balloon,B: space shuttle,C: clouds,D: house,E: supermarket,. Knowledge: The question is asking where air can be found to fill up balloons. The option "balloon" does not make sense as it refers to the object being filled, not the source of air. "Space shuttle" and "clouds" are not plausible sources of air for filling balloons. "House" may have air, but it is not a common place where people fill balloons. "Supermarket" is a likely answer as they often sell small canisters of compressed air for filling balloons. Answer is
supermarket
Question: She already had many friends, but she never stopped socialising to what? Options: A: having fun,B: become popular,C: become more popular,D: anxiety,E: she cannot do that when all are for her .,.

This suggests that they are seeking something beyond just having fun and may have a desire for more social status or popularity. Option C, "become more popular," directly references this idea and is therefore the correct answer. The other options are either too general or not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
become more popular

state facts

Options: A: shame,B: penalty,C: embarrassment,D: go to jail,E: indictment,. Knowledge: The sentence states that James is worried about committing perjury, which is a crime. Perjury is the act of lying under oath in a court of law, which is a serious offense that can result in jail time.

The other choices are also negative consequences, but they do not specifically relate to the crime of perjury. Answer is

sorrow

Question: If you are starting a fire on purpose and are caught what will happen? Options: A: death,B: burns,C: warmth,D: go to jail,E: get a reward,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that starting a fire on purpose is illegal and can lead to consequences. Going to jail is a common punishment for breaking the law, and starting fires without proper permits or in restricted areas is a crime in many places.

Warmth and a reward are irrelevant to the context and do not make sense as answers. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the speaker uses clothing as a way to express themselves. The use of "even ugly clothing" suggests that the speaker is not necessarily using their attire to be fashionable or to have fun, but rather to communicate something about themselves or their mood. The option "communication" is the most fitting choice, as it directly relates to the context of the sentence. "Embarrassment" may also seem possible, but since the sentence does not suggest that the speaker is intentionally embarrassing themselves, it is not the best answer. Answer is
communication
Question: Where is a safe space for a boat? Options: A: water,B: harbor,C: at sea,D: lake,E: ocean,.

A temperate climate may be comfortable for exploring gravesites, but it is not directly related to finding information about ancestors. Answer is
gravesite

The options "farmhouse" and "zoos" do not provide any useful information in this context. The option "cold place" is unlikely, as it would not be a suitable environment for a young animal. "Floor" is also unlikely, as the speaker would not have gone to the effort of putting a towel in a box if they intended for the kitten to sleep on the floor.

Schools may be open to the public for events, but they typically have designated entrances for students and faculty. Large buildings and auditoriums can have public access, but the sentence emphasizes the use of an entrance hall, which suggests a more formal type of building. A convention center is a possibility, but the sentence does not provide any clues as to whether the building hosts events or conferences, which are typically associated with convention centers.

Therefore, the options "lake or river" and "millpond" are likely places where a beaver would be found. The "helm of ship" option may be included since beavers are not typically found in marine environments. The "ontario" option may also be included since beavers are native to North America, including Ontario. However, "strip club" is an absurd and unrelated option that would be unlikely to be chosen. Answer is
strip club
Question: The fire was out of control.  If it wasn't stopped, it might do what to someone? Options: A: warm up,B: harm,C: charming,D: warm hands,E: murder,.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that bringing a lawsuit against a family member will have some negative consequence with the rest of the family. The choice "peace" is unlikely because lawsuits usually create conflict, not resolution. "Aggravation" and "randomness" are not specific enough and do not fit well with the context of the sentence.

The phrase "manually" suggests that there may be another way to turn on the television, which would be a physical switch or button. The option "plug in" does not make sense in this context because the sentence does not mention anything about needing to connect the TV to an electrical outlet. The other options, "kill", "open eyes", and "watch TV" do not fit the context of the situation. Answer is

The phrase "better himself" directly reflects this idea and suggests that the person is taking intentional steps to make progress in some area of their life. While the other options may be important for personal growth (e.g. sleep and keeping an open mind), they do not necessarily involve actively working on self-improvement. "Think and reason" and "think critically" may be part of the process of self-improvement, but they are not specific enough to be the correct answer in this context. Answer is

Question: The homeowner wanted new flooring installed, where did they want it specifically? Options: A: home depot,B: bundle,C: house,D: mansion,E: loft,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that the homeowner wanted new flooring installed in their home, which makes "house" the appropriate answer. The other options do not refer to a specific location within the context of the sentence. "Home Depot" is a store where one might purchase flooring, but it is not a specific location in the home. "Bundle" does not refer to a location at all, while "mansion" and "loft" are types of homes but do not specify where in the home the flooring is to be installed. Answer is
house
Question: Where is a good place to leave a car in public? Options: A: race track,B: parking lot,C: in the market place,D: city,E: repair shop,. Knowledge: A parking lot is a designated area for leaving cars in public, while the other options are not necessarily appropriate for leaving a car unattended. A race track, for example, is a place for racing cars and not for parking, while the market place is typically busy and crowded, making it difficult to find a safe and secure parking spot. Similarly, a repair shop is not designed for public parking, and the city is too broad of a location to offer any specific parking guidance. Answer is
parking lot
Question: What would rain do if you didn't have an umbrella? Options: A: tickle,B: water garden,C: wet clothes,D: wet ground,E: start to fall,. Knowledge: The question implies that if you don't have an umbrella, rain can have a negative impact on you. The choice "wet clothes" is the most likely answer since rain can saturate your clothing when you're without protection. The other options, such as "tickle" and "water garden," don't make sense given the context of the question. Answer is
wet clothes
Question: I went to eat in a restaurant, but I left because the person at the front wasn't what? Options: A: drinking wine,B: make reservations,C: polite,D: spit on me,E: prepared to pay,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the reason for leaving the restaurant was related to the behavior of the person at the front, and specifically their lack of politeness. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as they are either unrelated (drinking wine), or do not correspond to a negative behavior that would cause someone to leave a restaurant (making reservations, prepared to pay). Spit on me is an extreme negative behavior. Answer is
polite
Question: If an area is not thick with resource, those resources are what? Options: A: free flowing,B: translucent,C: sparse,D: slender,E: clear,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the area being described does not have a lot of resources.

The other options do not convey the same meaning and do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
sparse
Question: How might one go about instituting a civil action? Options: A: disobedience,B: court case,C: trial,D: anger,E: complications,. Knowledge: A civil action typically involves taking legal action against someone or something (such as a company or organization) in a court of law. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to involve legal procedures or processes. "Disobedience" and "anger" do not make sense in the context of taking legal action, while "complications" does not provide a specific action to take. "Trial" is a possibility, but it is more specific and refers to the formal process of presenting evidence and arguments in a court of law, whereas "court case" is a broader term that encompasses all legal proceedings related to a civil dispute. Answer is
court case
Question: What is the primary duty of a chef? Options: A: manual,B: thin sauce,C: study french cooking,D: cook dinner,E: prepare food,. Knowledge: The question is asking about the primary duty of a chef, which is the most important task they are responsible for. Chefs are primarily responsible for preparing food, which involves a wide range of tasks such as selecting ingredients, chopping and slicing vegetables and meats, cooking food to specific temperatures, and presenting dishes in an appealing way. While studying French cooking and creating thin sauces may be part of a chef's training, these tasks are not their primary duty. "Manual" is too vague and doesn't give any context, and "cook dinner" is too specific and doesn't cover all the tasks a chef may be responsible for. Answer is
prepare food
Question: He was trying to eat more green, as in simple ingredients rather than what foods? Options: A: ripe,B: greenweed,C: yellow,D: processed,E: cloy,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is trying to eat more simply, which often means avoiding processed foods that contain a lot of additives and preservatives. On the other hand, ripe and yellow are just descriptors of the color of foods and don't really connect to the idea of eating more simply. Greenweed is not a commonly known food, and cloy means overly sweet or rich, which also doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
processed
Question: What are you about to do after cashing in your chips at a casino? Options: A: retire,B: betrayal,C: resentment,D: leave,E: profit,. Knowledge: "Cashing in your chips" is a phrase commonly used in casinos to indicate exchanging your chips (currency used in casinos) for cash. Therefore, the question is asking what you would do after receiving your cash winnings. The most appropriate answer is "leave" since it implies that you will be exiting the casino after successfully cashing in your chips. The other options do not make sense in this context. Answer is
leave
Question: Why do people go hiking? Options: A: drink water,B: get lost,C: get tired,D: enjoy nature,E: hunger,. Knowledge: Hiking is a popular activity for people who enjoy being outdoors and surrounded by nature. It offers a chance to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of daily life and immerse oneself in the beauty and tranquility of natural surroundings. While staying hydrated by drinking water is important during a hike, it is not the main reason people go hiking. Getting lost and getting tired are risks associated with hiking, but they are not typically the goals of the activity. Hunger may be a consideration, but it is not the reason people choose to go hiking. Answer is
enjoy nature
Question: Sam put his return ticket in a special box.  It was where he kept all of his what? Options: A: airline envelope,B: airport,C: plane,D: tickets,E: keepsakes,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Sam put his "return ticket" in a special box. This suggests that he had other tickets that he also kept in the box, which makes "tickets" a likely option. The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence as well. An "airline envelope" could be a possibility, but it is not clear why Sam would keep all of his possessions in it, and the sentence does not mention any other items stored in the special box. "Airport" and "plane" do not make sense because Sam would not keep all of his possessions in these locations. "Keepsakes" is possible, but there is no clear indication that the special box was reserved for mementos or sentimental items. Answer is
tickets
Question: What would you hold by the handle while many people are watching you? Options: A: grasping things,B: the door,C: baseball bat,D: coffeepot,E: watering can,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being held by the handle is something that can be used for a public performance or display, since many people are watching. The phrase "grasping things" is too general and could apply to many different objects. Holding a door by the handle wouldn't involve any kind of performance or display. A watering can or coffeepot might be held by the handle, but they're not typically objects that would be used for public display or performance. A baseball bat, on the other hand, is often used in a public game or performance, and would be held by the handle during use. Answer is
baseball bat
Question: Jill is in a shopping complex in Ann Arbor, where is Jill? Options: A: suburbia,B: arizona,C: heavily developed area,D: michigan,E: big city,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions that Jill is in a shopping complex in Ann Arbor, which is a city in the state of Michigan. The other options do not have any relevance to the sentence and can be eliminated as incorrect answers. Choosing the correct answer requires basic knowledge of geography and an understanding of the context of the sentence. Answer is
michigan
Question: Where are you when you put your birth control pill to the test? Options: A: drug store,B: bedroom,C: chemist's shop,D: medicine cabinet,E: womans purse,. Knowledge: Birth control pills are typically taken at home, which suggests that the correct answer is likely to be a location where one might keep their medication at home. The other options include retail locations where one might purchase birth control pills, or spaces where a person might carry their medication with them, but these choices are less likely to be the correct answer based on the context given. The bedroom is a logical choice for where a person might take their birth control pill, as it is typically a private and comfortable space where one might feel most at ease when taking medication. Answer is
bedroom
Question: He always tried to shop local, he didn't like to support what kind of product? Options: A: homegrown,B: foreign,C: national,D: far away,E: worldwide,. Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that the person prefers to shop locally, which implies that they prioritize supporting local businesses and products. The opposite of local would be foreign, as products from other countries are not considered part of the local economy. The other options are not necessarily opposite to the concept of shopping local and do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
foreign
Question: Jim wanted to make a fortune but didn't like physical labor or dealing with people, what did he try studying? Options: A: cookie,B: real estate,C: stock market,D: treasure chest,E: treasure hunting,. Knowledge: The sentence gives clues about what Jim was interested in and what he wasn't interested in. It states that he didn't like physical labor or dealing with people, which suggests that he may have been looking for a less hands-on, more individual pursuit. The phrase "make a fortune" implies that he was interested in investments or financial gain. The option "stock market" fits both of these criteria and is the most likely answer. The other options - cookie, real estate, treasure chest, and treasure hunting - are not typically associated with making a fortune through investments or financial gain. Answer is
stock market
Question: Where would you put your change if you plan to use it soon and you are a man? Options: A: backseat of car,B: purse,C: pocket,D: jar,E: wallet,. Knowledge: The question suggests that the person being asked is a man and therefore would likely use pockets to store their change. Purses are typically associated with women, and jars and wallets are not convenient options for storing loose change if you plan to use it soon. The backseat of a car is also not a practical option for storing change that you plan to use on the go. Answer is
pocket
Question: When remembering you referencing things that you have what? Options: A: memory cells,B: learning about,C: prior knowledge of,D: brain cells,E: nerve cells,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that remembering something involves referencing something that you already have. This is commonly referred to as prior knowledge, or information that you have already learned and stored in your memory. The other options, such as memory cells and brain cells, are not accurate descriptions of the process of remembering. Nerve cells may be involved in the transmission of information, but they do not necessarily represent the information itself. Answer is
prior knowledge of
Question: If a person loses their balance while on roller skating and can't recover what happened to them? Options: A: injury,B: falling down,C: injuries,D: hit people,E: move fast,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a person lost their balance while roller skating and couldn't recover, which commonly results in falling down. The other options are not logical outcomes of losing balance while roller skating. Option "injury" could be a result of falling down, but it doesn't necessarily happen every time. Option "hit people" doesn't relate to the context at all while option "move fast" is irrelevant. Answer is
falling down
Question: He had an active imagination, sleeping was always an adventure because of his wild whats? Options: A: nightmares,B: death,C: when i have a nightmare,D: erections,E: dreams,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person has a vivid imagination that affects their sleep, suggesting they have adventurous and intense dreams. Nightmares and death are possibilities, but the sentence uses the word "wild" to describe the characteristic, which better fits with dreams. The option "when I have a nightmare" is a sentence fragment and not a valid choice. Erections are not related to the context of the sentence. Answer is
dreams
Question: Where would a zoo keep a lemur? Options: A: bank,B: australia,C: cage,D: forrest,E: hole,. Knowledge: Lemurs are wild animals and are typically kept in captivity in zoos or animal parks. They are usually kept in large cages or enclosures that mimic their natural habitat as closely as possible. The other options, such as a bank or a hole, have no connection to the context of the question and are unlikely places for a lemur to be kept. Answer is
cage
Question: James felt the best place to install the spa would be where? Options: A: resort,B: country club,C: attic,D: backyard,E: health centre,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James is considering where to install a spa, and the most appropriate location would be in a space that provides privacy and accessibility. A backyard is commonly associated with providing privacy and convenience, which would make it the most likely choice for a spa installation. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or imply a lack of privacy. Answer is
backyard
Question: What is the farmer's main goal? Options: A: farm land,B: beer cans,C: can produce,D: raise crops,E: seed plants,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the farmer has a goal related to agriculture. The phrase "raise crops" specifically implies that the farmer's main objective is to grow plants for food or other purposes. The other options, such as "farm land" and "beer cans," do not seem like plausible goals for a farmer, and "can produce" and "seed plants" are too vague to be the main goal. Answer is
raise crops
Question: When people in trance are trying to calm themselves what do they do? Options: A: run,B: confusion,C: meditate,D: epilepsy,E: hallucination,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that when people are in a state of trance and need to calm themselves, they engage in a specific action. Out of the given choices, meditating is the most appropriate answer as it involves focusing on one's breath and inner thoughts in order to reduce stress and promote relaxation. The other options - running, confusion, epilepsy, and hallucination - do not align with the context of the sentence and are therefore incorrect. Answer is
meditate
Question: Mable loved horses.  She'd do what with them every time she visited the farm? Options: A: clean,B: play,C: eat grass,D: dominated,E: kept in barn stalls,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Mable has a fondness for horses, which is unlikely to be expressed through activities like cleaning or dominating them. Eating grass is something that horses do, not people. Kept in barn stalls is a description of where the horses are housed, not an activity that Mable would engage in. This leaves playing with the horses as the most logical option, since it's a common way for people to interact with animals they enjoy being around. Answer is
play
Question: Where in your pants would you keep a kleenex? Options: A: pocket,B: box,C: blow nose,D: purse,E: bag,. Knowledge: Kleenex is a brand of tissue paper that is commonly used for wiping one's nose or face. The sentence suggests that the person is carrying a tissue paper in their pants, which is likely to be kept in a pocket as it is the most convenient and accessible place to store small items. The other options such as a box, purse, or bag are not typically associated with keeping a single tissue paper. "Blow nose" is an action that one may do with a Kleenex, but it is not a location. Answer is
pocket
Question: A person wants to be like Michael Phelps, what should they do first? Options: A: feel relieved,B: cross street,C: act responsibly,D: avoid swimming,E: learn to swim,. Knowledge: The question suggests that the person wants to emulate Michael Phelps, who is a highly successful swimmer. Learning to swim would be the first step towards achieving this goal. Crossing the street, feeling relieved, or acting responsibly are not relevant actions in this scenario. Avoiding swimming would also contradict the person's desire to be like Michael Phelps. Answer is
learn to swim
Question: What would happen if you are loving another and he or she does not love you? Options: A: satisfaction,B: peace,C: love,D: happiness,E: heartache,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests a situation where there is unrequited love, meaning one person loves the other but the feeling is not mutual. This can cause heartache, which is a feeling of emotional pain and sadness. The other options do not accurately reflect the emotional response to unrequited love. Answer is
heartache
Question: Where can you buy a pail, nails and a hammer? Options: A: garage,B: garden,C: hardware store,D: basement,E: utility room,. Knowledge: A pail, nails, and a hammer are all tools commonly used for home improvement or DIY projects. The context suggests that the person is looking to purchase these items, and the most likely place to find them all together would be a hardware store. The other options do not typically carry a wide range of tools and hardware. Answer is
hardware store
Question: Most lizards achieve locomotion using what? Options: A: four legs,B: bones,C: tail,D: change color of skin,E: backbone,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that lizards use a specific method for achieving locomotion, and the most common method among lizards is through the use of four legs. This is a general characteristic of reptiles, which typically have four limbs for walking and crawling. The other options do not describe a method of locomotion. Bones, backbone, and tail are all parts of the lizard's body, but they don't necessarily relate to how the lizard moves. Changing the color of the skin is a form of camouflage and does not necessarily have anything to do with locomotion. Answer is
four legs
Question: Where would a cat not belong? Options: A: back alley,B: swimming pool,C: milky way galaxy,D: compost pile,E: back yard,. Knowledge: The options are all physical locations, but the Milky Way Galaxy, being a massive collection of stars and celestial bodies, is not a place where a terrestrial animal like a cat could exist.

milky way galaxy
Question: Why does a bodybuilder eat so much? Options: A: pleasant conversation,B: store food for winter,C: satisfy hunger,D: sounds of digestion,E: gain weight,. Knowledge: Bodybuilders typically eat large amounts of food in order to gain weight and muscle mass. They need to consume a surplus of calories to support their intensive workouts and promote muscle growth. The other options, such as "pleasant conversation" and "sounds of digestion", do not make sense in the context of why a bodybuilder would eat so much. "Store food for winter" is not relevant to a human body and "satisfy hunger" suggests a normal level of eating, not excessive consumption associated with bodybuilders. Answer is
gain weight
Question: What is the intended biological function when a person has sex? Options: A: compliments,B: reproduce,C: sweating,D: talented,E: affluent,.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that while resting, a person is doing something that affects other people. Lying down, falling asleep, and time passing are all common activities while resting but do not have a direct impact on other people. Snoring, however, can affect other people's sleep or cause disturbance, making it the correct answer. "Loud" can also be a correct answer as it suggests a noisy activity that could disturb others, but it is less specific than snoring. Answer is
snore
Question: What does a shareholder own? Options: A: building,B: large company,C: headache,D: financial trouble,E: factory,. Knowledge: Shareholders own a portion of a company's stock, which represents a share of ownership in that company.

large company

Knowledge: Canada is a country that has two official languages: English and French.

The other options are either not relevant to the question or come after the initial step of getting out of bed. Answer is
get out of bed

Knowledge: The context of the question suggests that it is related to hosting guests in a house. When unexpected guests arrive and there is not enough seating available, it is common to bring out folding chairs to accommodate everyone. In a house, the most appropriate place to put additional chairs would be in a room where guests can gather and socialize, such as a living room or dining room. The other options listed, such as an auditorium, ocean, church, or garage, are unlikely to be relevant or appropriate in this context. Answer is

hear sounds

Knowledge: If the person does not have a shirt pocket to carry the sunglasses, the next logical choice would be to store them in a bag or purse. The other options do not make as much sense - putting them in shoes would be uncomfortable and potentially damaging to the sunglasses, storing them in a drugstore is not relevant to the question, and the glove compartment is not a portable solution if the person wants to bring the sunglasses with them. Answer is
bag
Question: What type of gift shop can you by replicas of paintings? Options: A: railway station,B: disneyland,C: airport,D: museum,E: hotel,. Knowledge: Gift shops in museums often sell replicas of paintings as part of their merchandise.

The other options may have gift shops, but they are less likely to sell replicas of paintings. For example, while Disney and hotels may sell souvenirs, they are not typically focused on art replicas. Answer is
museum

Question: Where is a bad place to put a cemetery? Options: A: churchyard,B: country,C: most cities,D: funeral,E: populated area,.

Cemetery locations should be chosen carefully to ensure that they do not pose any risks to public health or the environment. The other options may be suitable for cemetery locations depending on various factors, such as the size of the area, the local laws and regulations, and the cultural practices of the community. Answer is
populated area

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Wendy's toy is damaged in some way, and that she believes she can fix it. The other options do not relate to repairing or fixing something that is broken. "Raise" or "make" are not appropriate in this context because they suggest creating something new, while "reincarnate" refers to the idea of coming back to life after death, which does not apply here. "Build" also suggests creating something new, rather than fixing something that already exists. Answer is
repair
Question: You can find a protected forest in just about any what? Options: A: temperate zone,B: national park,C: south africa,D: countryside,E: amazon basin,. Knowledge: The word "protected" suggests that the forest is under some form of conservation or government regulation.

national park

Options: A: these twos are incorrect answers,B: bed,C: basement,D: floor,E: store,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the boxes of toys were put in long term storage, which is commonly found in a basement. Basements are often used for storage as they are a cool, dry place that is out of the way. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the mother needed to put away a plate, which is a common item found in a kitchen. The options of flea market, museum, and restaurant do not make logical sense since they are not locations where someone would typically store a plate. The option of dishwasher is a possibility, but the sentence does not give any indication that the mother specifically put the plate in the dishwasher. Therefore, the most logical choice is the kitchen cupboard, where plates are commonly stored. Answer is
kitchen cupboard
Question: What do those of a relative committing suicide likely to feel? Options: A: sorrow,B: uncomfortable,C: harm to others,D: being dead,E: death,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone's relative committed suicide, which is often a tragic and deeply painful experience for the family and loved ones left behind. "Sorrow" is a synonym for grief or sadness, and it is a reasonable answer to the question based on the context of the sentence. "Uncomfortable," "harm to others," "being dead," and "death" are all possible emotions or outcomes that might be associated with suicide, but they are not specifically mentioned in the sentence, so they are less likely to be the correct answer. Answer is
sorrow
Question: Where would you put a saw if you do not need to use it soon and your house only has one floor? Options: A: logging camp,B: in the vehicle,C: tool shed,D: toolbox,E: basement,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the saw is not needed immediately but will be needed in the future. It also states that the house has only one floor, which suggests that there is no basement. Putting the saw in a logging camp or in a vehicle does not make sense since these are not typical locations where one would store tools. The most logical choice is a tool shed, which is a common location for storing tools and equipment. The toolbox is also a possible choice, but the question specifies that the saw will not be needed soon, so it may be too small to hold a saw. Answer is
tool shed
Question: You can do what do share your memories of visiting a museum? Options: A: cry,B: take pictures,C: talk loudly,D: whisper,E: entertainment,. Knowledge: The sentence is asking for a way to share memories of visiting a museum, which suggests a method for recording the memories.

Question: Why would someone be listening to music? Options: A: dance,B: profit,C: enjoyment,D: keep time,E: learning,. Knowledge: Listening to music is often associated with pleasure and entertainment. People may listen to music to relax, uplift their mood, or enjoy the emotional and artistic expression conveyed through the music. While music can also be used for dancing, keeping time, or learning (such as in music education), these purposes are not necessarily the primary reason someone would listen to music. Profit is also not a common reason for listening to music, as most listeners do not directly profit from listening to music. Answer is
enjoyment
Question: Billy was a forgiving person.  When Marna confessed to him, she felt what? Options: A: redemption,B: absolution,C: great relief,D: very sad,E: make up,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that Marna did something wrong and confessed it to Billy. Since Billy is described as a forgiving person, it can be inferred that he responded positively to the confession. The fact that Marna felt relief indicates that she was worried about how Billy would react, but his forgiveness put her at ease. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
great relief
Question: What task can a lawyer plan for to engage a witness who has been difficult to find? Options: A: come early,B: state case,C: nullified,D: clear of all charges,E: produce evidence,. Knowledge: The question is asking what a lawyer can do to engage a difficult-to-find witness, which implies that the witness is present but not easily accessible. Coming early would allow the lawyer to meet with the witness and discuss their testimony, potentially building a rapport and making them more willing to participate in the case. The other options do not relate to engaging a difficult-to-find witness. "State case" implies the lawyer is presenting their case to a judge or jury, which may not involve the witness at all. "Nullified" and "clear of all charges" suggest the case has already been resolved, which would not be relevant for engaging a witness. "Produce evidence" may be a part of engaging a witness, but it does not address the issue of difficulty in finding them. Answer is

Question: Beside clasping their hands what do people do when praying? Options: A: whisper,B: kneel down,C: bow,D: talking to god,E: ask for help,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are doing something in addition to clasping their hands while praying. Kneeling down is a common posture for prayer in many religious traditions, making it the most likely answer. Whispering and talking to God are also common when praying, but they are not actions people do in addition to clasping their hands. Bowing may be a part of some prayer traditions, but it is not always done alongside clasping the hands. Asking for help is not necessarily an action that people physically do while praying. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John needs a tool to take off the blade of his lawnmower. A screwdriver is a common tool found in a toolkit or a tool belt, so these options would be the most likely places for John to look for his screwdriver. A handyman or a repair shop might have the tool, but it's not clear from the sentence whether John would need to go to those places or if he already has the tool. A bar would not be a typical place to find a screwdriver. Answer is
toolkit

The word "wherever" suggests that he is open to any option and does not have a preference, but is leaving the decision up to his wife. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is

The other options do not relate to the discovery phase of a trial - lawyers may charge a fee for their services, but this is not specific to the discovery phase; coming early is not a requirement; convicting is the goal of the trial, not a requirement of the discovery phase; and stating the case is done during the trial itself, not the discovery phase. Answer is

This implies that he was able to build up momentum and work efficiently once he got started. Panic, stress, and anxiety are negative emotions that would likely hinder James' ability to work.

The options "library" and "house" do not have any clear connection to a specific location where a telephone is found. "Under chair" could suggest a random location where a phone book may or may not be present. "At hotel" is not specific enough and could refer to various locations within a hotel.

Knowledge: The sentence implies that at the age of 19 years, most people have completed a certain milestone. Going to jail or dying suddenly is not a common occurrence for individuals at the age of 19. While belief in God is a personal choice, it is not necessarily linked to age. Crossing a river may happen to some individuals at any age, but it is not a universal experience that applies to most people at 19 years of age. Therefore, the logical answer is completing high school, as this is a developmental milestone that is typically reached by the age of 19 years. Answer is

The options "lame," "ocean," and "dry" do not have any clear connection to taste preferences, while "sour" may be a contrasting taste but is not directly related to snack foods.

The other options do not relate to a part that can be replaced, such as taking notes and using color which suggest how to use the pen or caps which are more protective measures. Answer is

"Satisfy hunger" is the most logical answer as it directly answers the question of why James wanted to eat a hamburger.

Knowledge: The question suggests that the sponge is meant to clean something, and the only option that relates to cleaning is "clean dishes." However, the option appears twice, which suggests that it is a mistake, and the correct answer must be "wet surface," which refers to the sponge's primary function of absorbing and wiping away liquid from various surfaces. "Collect water" and "hold water" are not related to cleaning, and there is already an identical option. Answer is

Additionally, the fact that some people find the event boring and loud fits in with the idea of a race track where the sound of engines or galloping hooves can be quite loud. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

The word "remembered" implies that James forgot to pack the tools at an earlier time, possibly before he left for his current location.

The context of the sentence, "center of the room," is most commonly associated with a theatre, as that is where audiences gather to view performances.

The options "a fraud" and "thought" do not make sense in this context, while "countries" is too small of a unit to contain the world.

Question: If one is neutral with regards to seeing idea become reality what would they most likely feel? Options: A: fulfilling,B: elation,C: accomplished,D: feeling good,E: being satisfied,.

Therefore, if someone is neutral about an idea becoming a reality, they are unlikely to feel a strong sense of fulfillment or elation. "Accomplished" suggests that they were actively involved in making the idea a reality, which may not be the case if they are neutral. "Feeling good" is too general and does not specifically relate to the idea becoming a reality. "Being satisfied" is the best option as it suggests a reasonable level of contentment without a strong emotional response. Answer is
being satisfied
Question: The jelly was opened and likely to spoil, where should someone put it? Options: A: away,B: jar,C: donuts,D: peanut butter,E: refrigerator,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the jelly was opened and at risk of spoiling, so it needs to be stored properly. The most common place to store perishable items like this is in the refrigerator, which helps slow the growth of bacteria and keep the food fresher for longer.

Out of the options, "falling down" is the most likely thing to go wrong while climbing. "Exhaustion" does not fit the context of fear, while "accomplishment" and "exhilaration" are positive feelings that do not fit with the fear suggested by the sentence.

Feeling full after a meal is a natural response that signals the body has received enough nutrients and energy to function properly.

The other options, such as there being no more food or feeling sleepy, do not necessarily explain why the person has stopped eating. Answer is

The options "pantry," "planes," and "kitchen" are not places where cabinets would typically be made. "Texas" could be a potential answer, but the author's mention of checking both the undersink and oversink cabinets suggests that the cabinets were not made domestically.

The living room is a common area in the house for relaxation and watching TV, making it the most likely option. The other choices do not make sense in this context - a play mat would not be practical in a pool or a bathroom and it would be unlikely for a school to allow a play mat in their classrooms.

Putting money under a pillow is a traditional practice for the tooth fairy to leave money in exchange for a lost tooth, but it is not a common long-term storage solution for coins. A change purse is also a possible option, but it may not be as commonly used or associated with children as a piggy bank. Answer is

Ontario and Canada are both locations where beavers can be found, but they do not answer the question of what kind of habitat the beaver lives in.

The option "debt" may be a consequence of waiting until the last minute to shop, but it is not directly related to the experience of waiting. "Pleasure" and "good cheer" are positive experiences that are unlikely to result from waiting until the last minute to buy Christmas presents. "Lack of money" may also be a consequence of waiting until the last minute, but it does not specifically relate to the experience of waiting. Therefore, "stress" is the most likely correct answer as it is a common negative experience associated with procrastination and last-minute shopping. Answer is

A trunk fits this description, as it is typically a large, rectangular container with a tight-fitting lid that keeps out bugs and dust.

Options: A: hotel,B: apartment,C: couch,D: guest room,E: house,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was not comfortable sleeping on Mary's hide sofa bed.

The options "father" and "arm" are not related to food and do not make sense in the context. "Museum" is also not related to the context and is an unlikely option for a bone found in food.

It is not uncommon for marathon runners to feel completely drained after completing the race, as they have just exerted an enormous amount of energy.

The word "feeble" means weak and lacking physical strength, which contradicts the idea that the bull still had enough energy for sex. The other options, such as "charge rider" and "bullbleep," do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Female" and "cow" are both incorrect because the sentence specifies that the subject of the sentence is a bull, which is a male bovine. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the office is in need of new computers, but upgrading them would be a challenge for some reason. The context of the sentence indicates that the issue is related to money, since the word "expensive" is a common adjective used to describe something that costs a lot.

It is common for musicians to play while wearing headphones to listen to themselves or the other musicians they are playing with, and a soundproof booth with a window allows for visual communication while minimizing sound interference.

This means achieving a satisfactory level of understanding and mastery of the subject matter. While studying history and asking questions are also important aspects of learning and becoming a successful student, they do not necessarily indicate a student's overall performance in school sessions. Similarly, "Michigan" is not relevant to the context of the question, and "better grade" is too vague to be a correct answer. Answer is
pass course

"One dimensional" does not make sense in the context of disposing of paper. Answer is

This narrows down the choices to farmer's field and vegetable garden. However, the context of the sentence suggests a larger area, so farmer's field is the more accurate choice. The other options, such as sequence of similar things or auditorium, do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
farmer's field

Of the choices provided, running out of money is the most plausible reason for someone to stop buying products. Comparison shopping refers to the process of comparing prices and features of different products before making a purchase, so it doesn't necessarily lead someone to stop buying products altogether. Overstocking refers to having an excess of products, which is not related to why someone would stop buying products.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the canned vegetables need to be stored over the winter, indicating that they are to be kept long-term. The microwave and salad are not suitable storage options as they are not designed for long-term storage. The farmer's market is a place where vegetables are sold, not stored.

A music store would be the most likely option as they typically have a selection of instruments for customers to try out.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is leaving and needs to pack their belongings. Keeping a shirt in a drawer or on the floor would not be practical for packing.

Knowledge: Bald eagles are known to prefer open areas near water, such as lakes, rivers, and coastlines, where they can easily hunt for fish. Open country would provide the eagle with ample space to fly and locate prey. While it's possible for bald eagles to live in other environments such as mountains or pine trees, open country is the most relevant answer based on the bird's habits and preferences. Wildlife refuges and specific locations like Colorado are not necessarily indicative of bald eagle habitats, making them less likely choices. Answer is
open country

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John's efforts were not able to prevent the computer from stopping working. "Crash" is a common term used to describe when a computer suddenly stops working due to a technical issue, which makes it the most likely answer. "Old equipment" could also be a possibility, but the sentence does not suggest that the computer stopped working due to its age, so it is less likely. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
crash
Question: What can be the result of too much lunch too often? Options: A: sickness,B: obesity,C: heartburn,D: spending money,E: bloat,.

Selling hotdogs and falling asleep are also unlikely given the context of attending a meeting. Therefore, the most likely reason for Susan to attend a KKK meeting would be to gather information, either for personal interest or for a journalistic or investigative purpose. Answer is
getting information
Question: If I needed help with answering questions, what would help me? Options: A: getting tired,B: better grade,C: sharing information,D: interesting,E: teaching,.

Nightgowns may also be made from silk, but the sentence does not provide any context to suggest that this is the correct answer. Mulberry trees are the primary food source for silkworms, which produce silk, but this answer choice is not asking about the raw material used to make silk. Chinatown and bushes have no connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

working
Question: Why does wood float? Options: A: it is a good swimmer,B: solid,C: gilded,D: less dense than water,E: porous,. Knowledge: Wood is less dense than water because of its cellular and fibrous structure. This means that the amount of matter in a given volume of wood is less than that of an equal volume of water.

Answer is
pass class

"Headache" and "good things in life" are unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
own house

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Lane introduced James to Sam, leading Sam to think that James was a native. This implies that Lane knew James and had some level of familiarity with him, and that Lane's introduction created the impression for Sam that James was a local. The other choices (guide foreigners, foreigner, established, immigrant) do not fit the context of the sentence, which is discussing how Sam's perception of James was influenced by Lane's actions. Answer is
introduced
Question: There is very little original art these days.  How might most art be described? Options: A: copy,B: derivative,C: reproduction,D: simile,E: internet,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that much of the art that is being created today is not entirely original.

The other options do not fit with the idea of originality or creativity, and are therefore not appropriate choices. Answer is
derivative
Question: The human always would have fun making up questions for the A.I. overlords, he found the task quite what? Options: A: do enjoy,B: eat cake,C: enjoy living,D: get laid,E: enjoyable,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the human enjoys making up questions for the A.I. overlords, so the correct answer should be a synonym for "enjoyable." "Do enjoy" and "enjoy living" both contain similar words, but they don't fit the sentence structure as well as "enjoyable" does. "Eat cake" and "get laid" are completely unrelated and can be eliminated as options. Answer is
enjoyable
Question: Where might someone play with a frisbee? Options: A: golf course,B: park,C: roof,D: air,E: deadhead's van,. Knowledge: Frisbee is a popular outdoor activity that is typically played in open spaces like parks, beaches or fields. While it is possible to throw a frisbee on a roof or in the air, these are not typical locations for playing the game. A golf course is also an unlikely location for frisbee play, as it is usually reserved for the sport of golf. The option "deadhead's van" does not make sense in the context of the question. Answer is
park

northern hemisphere
Question: What article of apparel or accessory is typically made of felt? Options: A: shoes,B: table,C: hat shop,D: clothes,E: man's hat,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the item being referred to is made of felt, which is a common material used in the production of hats. Additionally, the specific mention of a "man's hat" narrows down the options to a specific type of hat, as opposed to shoes, tables, or clothes. The option "hat shop" is not an article of apparel or accessory, but rather a location where items such as hats may be purchased. Answer is
man's hat
Question: Where would you get a marker if you do not have one? Options: A: office supply store,B: desk,C: pocket,D: drawer,E: briefcase,. Knowledge: The question implies that the person does not currently possess a marker, so they would need to obtain one from somewhere else. The most likely place to find a marker would be an office supply store, as that is a common location for purchasing writing implements. The other options (desk, pocket, drawer, briefcase) are all possible locations, but they would depend on if the person had already had a marker there, which the question does not suggest. Answer is
office supply store
Question: What would you use to find out if there will be a cloud in the sky? Options: A: night or day,B: atmosphere,C: car,D: murky liquid,E: weather report,. Knowledge: The other options do not provide any relevant information about whether there will be a cloud in the sky. "Night or day" and "atmosphere" are too general and broad to provide any specific information about cloud formation. "Car" and "murky liquid" have no connection to the context of the question. The most logical and reliable source of information about weather conditions is a weather report, which can provide specific forecasts for cloud cover. Answer is
weather report
Question: Where is a small house likely to have a table? Options: A: dining room,B: furniture store,C: kitchen,D: roof,E: conference,. Knowledge: A small house typically has limited space, which means that a dining room or conference room may not be present. Additionally, a furniture store or roof would not typically have a table in the context of a small house. However, the kitchen is a common place to have a table in a small house, as it can serve as both a dining area and a workspace. Therefore, the correct answer is likely to be kitchen. Answer is
kitchen
Question: What's the place every grape wants to go in the end? Options: A: painting,B: field,C: fruit stand,D: winery,E: garage,. Knowledge: Grapes are typically grown for the purpose of making wine, and the winery is where the grapes are processed and turned into wine. While grapes may end up in other places, such as a fruit stand, field, or garage, the correct answer is the winery because it is the final destination for grapes that are grown for winemaking. The option "painting" does not make sense in this context since grapes cannot physically go into a painting. Answer is
winery
Question: Where do animals frolick? Options: A: fairgrounds,B: kennel,C: surface of earth,D: meadow,E: zoos,. Knowledge: Animals are often associated with open spaces and natural environments like meadows, where they can run, play and interact with one another.

Answer is
meadow

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the activity being described involves playing basketball, which is a sport commonly played in a gymnasium.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
gymnasium

Question: Plenty of love, candy and a small dog always awaited them, so the children always loved visiting where? Options: A: own home,B: basket,C: grandmother's house,D: apartment complex,E: trailer park,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children loved visiting a place that had love, candy, and a small dog. This indicates that the place was likely a comfortable and welcoming environment, and the fact that a small dog was mentioned suggests that it may have been a home rather than a communal living space like an apartment complex or trailer park. The mention of "grandmother's" further suggests a familial setting, making "grandmother's house" the most fitting choice among the options given. Answer is
grandmother's house
Question: What kind of performance can be viewed on a DVD? Options: A: concert hall,B: circus,C: movie,D: theatre,E: singing,. Knowledge: A DVD typically contains a recording of a movie, which is a cinematic production. Concert halls, circuses, and theatres typically offer live performances that are not typically recorded on DVD, although some concerts or theatrical productions may be recorded and sold as DVDs after the fact. Singing is a broad category that could technically apply to any of the other performance types listed, so it is not a helpful clue in this context. Answer is
movie
Question: You can buy gum, candy and popcorn before watching what? Options: A: water fountain,B: store,C: sidewalk,D: hospital,E: movies,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is buying gum, candy, and popcorn before watching something. The only option that fits with this context is movies, as they are typically associated with purchasing snacks before viewing a film.

The option of hospital does not fit either, as the sentence does not indicate that the person is going to a hospital to watch something. Answer is
movies

The other options do not align with the advice given by the therapist or the context of the sentence. Answer is
friendships
Question: Where would you keep a cardboard box full of car parts? Options: A: post office,B: garage,C: trash,D: under bed,E: warehouse,. Knowledge: Car parts are typically stored in a location that is easily accessible and related to the maintenance or repair of vehicles.

death

Of the options provided, only an office building fits this description. A brownstone is typically a small residential building, a highrise building could house a variety of businesses and individuals, a hotel would not necessarily require workers in suits and ties, and a school would most likely not have a ground floor designated for professional workers. Answer is
office building

Knowledge: Hydrogen is a gas that is often used in chemistry labs, where it can be stored in containers for various experiments. While it is also found in the universe and as a component of air, these options do not specifically refer to containers that would hold hydrogen. The ocean and barrel options do not make sense in the context of storing hydrogen. Answer is
chemistry lab
Question: Billy is an archaeologist. He looks for information about ancient human civilization. What is something that he might enjoy finding? Options: A: school,B: love,C: adventure,D: space shuttle,E: library,. Knowledge: Since Billy is an archaeologist who is interested in ancient human civilization, he is more likely to enjoy finding a library than the other options. A library contains books and manuscripts that may provide valuable information about the culture and history of a particular civilization. The other options such as school, love, adventure, and space shuttle do not necessarily have a connection to archaeology or ancient civilization. Answer is
library
Question: The man has much to do, but was watching tv, what was he doing? Options: A: arguments,B: entertainment,C: having fun,D: get fat,E: wasting time,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man is not engaged in something productive, and rather than focusing on his work or responsibilities, he is watching television. The phrase "much to do" implies that he has responsibilities or tasks that require his attention, but he is choosing to prioritize entertainment over completing them, which suggests he is wasting time. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
wasting time
Question: What does getting in line for a long time require in a person? Options: A: intention,B: getting in the front of the line,C: basic organization,D: early childhood socialization,E: patience,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that getting in line for a long time can be difficult or challenging for a person, indicating that certain traits or characteristics may be needed in order to do so successfully. The option "patience" directly addresses this, suggesting that waiting in line requires a certain level of endurance and ability to tolerate discomfort or frustration. The other options do not directly relate to this idea or provide a convincing explanation for what is needed to wait in line. Answer is
patience
Question: What is likely to cause pain when going for a run? Options: A: leg cramps,B: becoming tired,C: feeling refreshed,D: self realization,E: satisfaction,.

ante up
Question: The final boarding group was called, once everybody was in their seat the what could depart? Options: A: theatre,B: in wedding hall,C: show,D: airplane,E: auditorium,. Knowledge: The use of the phrase "boarding group" suggests that the sentence is referring to an activity in an airport, which is often associated with airplane travel. The other options - theatre, wedding hall, show, and auditorium - have no clear connection to airplane travel and therefore are not likely to be the correct answer. Answer is

Question: James looked for an out of the way spot for his new floor lamp. Where might he have put it? Options: A: office,B: desktop,C: corner,D: next to the bed,E: at hotel,. Knowledge: The phrase "out of the way spot" suggests that James was looking for a location that is not in the main area or easily visible. A corner is a logical choice for such a location as it is often away from the center of the room and can provide a cozy and intimate setting for a floor lamp. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence, as an office or desktop would be too visible and next to the bed and at a hotel do not specify a location within a room. Answer is
corner
Question: Where would you put a writing instrument if you are a man and want to bring it with you? Options: A: pocket,B: purse,C: briefcase,D: classroom,E: desk drawer,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the question is asking about a portable writing instrument that a man may want to bring with him. The options of purse and desk drawer are associated with women and stationary locations, respectively, and are therefore unlikely to be correct. A briefcase is a possibility, but not all men carry a briefcase, and the question seems to be asking for the most common answer. A classroom is a location, not a place to put a writing instrument. A pocket, on the other hand, is a common and convenient place for a man to put a writing instrument when he is on-the-go. Answer is
pocket
Question: The electricity went out, and people couldn't see during worship, where were they? Options: A: concert,B: garden,C: bedroom,D: church,E: opera,.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sarah did not allow proper ventilation for the birds in the jar. Birds need to breathe, so lack of air flow would be harmful or fatal to them. The other options do not make sense in this context - picking berries or reproducing would not be relevant to why the birds died, and the terms "sky" and "roof" do not relate to the situation at all. Answer is
breathe
Question: Snoopy thought Charlie wanted to play fetch, but Charlie was just treating his pet what for fleas? Options: A: house,B: cat,C: carpet,D: rug,E: dog,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions Snoopy and Charlie, who are commonly associated with the comic strip "Peanuts" by Charles M. Schulz. Snoopy is a dog, which can help rule out the options cat, house, carpet, and rug. The sentence mentions that Charlie was treating his pet, which also suggests that the correct answer is related to an animal. Therefore, the correct answer must be dog as it is the only option that is related to an animal and fits the context of the sentence. Answer is
dog
Question: What is a great way for teens to build character and pad their resume? Options: A: hang out,B: volunteer,C: smoke,D: be stranded on a desert island,E: homework,. Knowledge: The question asks about building character and padding a resume, which suggests that the answer should be something that is seen as a positive trait or accomplishment. Hanging out and smoking are not productive activities that would typically be included on a resume or seen as character-building. Being stranded on a desert island may be a unique experience, but it is not something that one can actively choose to do. Homework is important for academic success, but it is not necessarily related to building character or padding a resume. On the other hand, volunteering is a common way for teens to gain valuable experiences, develop skills, and demonstrate their commitment to helping others, all of which can enhance their character and impress potential employers or colleges. Answer is
volunteer
Question: If one is without happiness, what might they not be experiencing and need to do? Options: A: fiddle,B: sing,C: play games,D: live life,E: run in circles,. Knowledge: The context suggests that the person in question is lacking happiness, which is most commonly associated with a fulfilling and enjoyable life. The choices "fiddle," "sing," "play games," and "run in circles" do not directly address the issue of unhappiness, while "live life" offers a solution that is relevant and logical. Answer is
live life
Question: Billy needed his hammer, so he looked where? Options: A: hardware store,B: toolbelt,C: repair shop,D: backpack,E: tool box,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy was looking for a tool that he needed in order to do some work that required a hammer. The most obvious place to keep a hammer would be in a tool box, which is designed specifically to hold tools. The other options could also contain tools, but they are less likely choices because they are not designed specifically to hold tools like a tool box is. Answer is
tool box
Question: The young boy was scared to dance, he found a corner of the auditorium and spent the whole evening doing what? Options: A: am happy,B: celebrate,C: moving,D: partner,E: sitting still,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the young boy was afraid to dance and chose to spend the entire evening in a corner of the auditorium. The phrase "sitting still" suggests that he did not move around or participate in any activities, indicating that he was likely feeling anxious or uncomfortable. The other options, such as "celebrate" and "partner," do not fit the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be correct answers. Answer is
sitting still
Question: John was 15 and this was the first year he would get to do what? Options: A: teach class,B: try to get,C: go to high school,D: go to class,E: study book,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John is reaching an age when he is starting high school. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Teach class" would be unlikely for a 15-year-old, "try to get" is unclear, "go to class" is too generic and doesn't convey any particular goal or milestone, and "study book" doesn't make sense as a standalone activity. Answer is
go to high school
Question: When you go on vacation what do you have to do with things you want to take with you? Options: A: pay bills,B: save money,C: pack,D: sell,E: have money,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that when going on vacation, one needs to do something with the things they want to take with them. The most logical option for this would be to pack those items. Paying bills and saving money are unrelated to the context of the sentence. Selling items is not necessary unless one is trying to downsize or make extra money. Having money is also not related to the act of packing. Answer is
pack
Question: Where do you look to see a meteor? Options: A: outerspace,B: orbit,C: universe,D: sky,E: observatory,. Knowledge: Meteors are visible from Earth's atmosphere, so the correct answer would be a location that can be observed from our planet. Outerspace and orbit are too far away to see a meteor with the naked eye and an observatory may be useful in tracking and predicting meteor showers, but not necessary to see a single meteor. Universe refers to everything that exists, so it is not a specific location on Earth to observe a meteor. Answer is
sky
Question: A single person is going to a party of other singles, what do they want to do? Options: A: visit friends,B: race cars,C: meeting people,D: having fun,E: drinking alcohol,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the person is going to a party of other singles, which likely means that they are looking to socialize and meet new people. The other options, such as racing cars or visiting friends, do not necessarily align with the context of going to a party and meeting new people. Additionally, while drinking alcohol may be a common activity at parties, it is not necessarily the main reason why someone would go to a party of other singles. Answer is
meeting people
Question: They decided to have desert after their meal, they chose chocolate cake from the desert tray at the what? Options: A: buffet,B: movies,C: restaurant,D: box,E: supermarket,.

restaurant

Knowledge: The question suggests that waiting for a sale may be a good idea before making a purchase. The word "buying" is the only choice that directly connects to this idea. The other options are either specific store names or descriptors that do not give any indication of whether or not it is a good idea to wait for a sale before making a purchase. Answer is
buying

Options: A: sweating,B: cheers,C: have fun,D: knee injury,E: pain,. Knowledge: The sentence states that the person is playing basketball through an injury, indicating that they are experiencing pain. The phrase "ignore the pain" is a common expression used when someone is trying to push through discomfort to achieve a goal. The other options do not relate to the context of the sentence, as sweating, cheers, and having fun are not obstacles to playing with an injury, and the knee injury is already mentioned in the sentence. Answer is
pain
Question: It was a crude building with drafting floors, so all  the friends slept high in lofts while at the remote what? Options: A: soho,B: frame house,C: hunting lodge,D: apartment building,E: bed,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the building in question is a rustic or primitive structure with drafting floors. The fact that the friends slept in lofts also implies that the building has a high ceiling.

The other options do not fit the characteristics defined in the sentence. Answer is
hunting lodge
Question: Joe found that shopping  was dangerous for him.  Even though he had a great job, or maybe because of it, he found himself doing this a great deal.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Joe's shopping habit was causing him some negative consequences despite having a good job and having extra funds. The word "dangerous" implies that there might be some risky or harmful behavior involved, which could be overspending. The phrase "not enough for his taste" suggests that Joe was looking to spend more money than what he had, indicating that he might be overspending. The other options do not seem to accurately reflect the context of the sentence. Answer is
overspending
Question: When talking to someone what should you maintain? Options: A: being heard,B: eye contact,C: connection,D: conversation,E: not listening,. Knowledge: Maintaining eye contact is one of the key elements in having successful communication with someone. It shows that you are engaged and paying attention to what they are saying, and can help to build trust and connection between the parties involved. The other options do not contribute to successful communication and may even hinder it. "Being heard" and "conversation" are important, but maintaining eye contact is a specific action that helps achieve these goals. "Not listening" obviously has nothing to do with successful communication. Answer is
eye contact
Question: Large trucks can fling rocks on the highway, this can be trouble for cars and their whats? Options: A: windows,B: seat belts,C: trunks,D: diesel engines,E: exhaust pipe,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that large trucks have the ability to fling rocks on the highway, which can be problematic for other cars.

planting

control panel

Therefore, "taste sweet" is the most logical and supported answer. Answer is
taste sweet

Options: A: careful,B: thoughtful,C: complete,D: thorough,E: intricate,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John missed the real cause of death because he only gave a perfunctory examination. This implies that if he had done a more thorough examination, he may have found the real cause of death. Therefore, the correct answer is "thorough." The other options don't necessarily imply a more in-depth examination, and therefore are not as relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Shopping bags are a common way to transport groceries, and the other options do not make sense in this context.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John and Betty are in a romantic relationship, and that they engage in a specific activity when they are alone together. Of the choices provided, kissing is the most likely activity for a romantic couple to engage in while alone together. Proposing to a woman can be done in private, but it is not an activity that a couple typically engages in together, and singing, living life, and dancing are all very broad and non-specific activities that do not fit the context of the sentence as well as kissing does. Answer is
kiss
Question: The banana was green and full of sugar.   Bart took a bite and immediately felt what? Options: A: cloy,B: ripe,C: processed,D: yellow,E: glucose,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the banana was sweet because it was "full of sugar", and yet it was green suggesting that the banana was not yet ripe. If a banana is not yet ripe, it can be hard and starchy, making it difficult to eat, and the fact that the banana was "full of sugar" suggests that it might have been cloying, which means overly sweet or sickly. Therefore, the best answer is 'cloy'. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
cloy
Question: The meat was ready to cook, it needed to go in where for at least four hours? Options: A: oven,B: ham sandwich,C: a pot,D: butcher shop,E: frying pan,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the meat needs to be cooked for a significant amount of time, at least four hours, which suggests that it needs to be slow-cooked. Using a pot or a frying pan may not be suitable for slow cooking because the meat will be exposed to direct heat. A ham sandwich and a butcher shop are not relevant to the cooking process. Therefore, the correct answer is an oven. Answer is
oven

drink water

The phrase "out there" implies that the friend is in a location where fishing is possible, and the fact that he surprised the speaker suggests that he was not expected to be there. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence because they do not relate to fishing or being "out there." Answer is
catching fish

Options: A: dining room,B: shelf,C: restaurant,D: cupboard,E: stomach,.

The other choices do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence (e.g., dining room and cupboard are locations where food is stored, while shelf does not indicate any connection to food at all). "Stomach" is the result of John eating, not the location where he ate. Answer is

roof
Question: John wanted to take pictures of wild gazelle. Where might he go to find one? Options: A: kalahari desert,B: open plain,C: sheep pen.,D: trophy room,E: ball gown,. Knowledge: Wild gazelles are a type of antelope that can be found in various habitats, but they are often associated with dry and arid regions such as the Kalahari desert.

kalahari desert

"Toolbox" and "toolkit" are possible options, but the fact that the person always kept a screwdriver behind it implies that it is a place they frequent often and casually - this does not fit the context of a toolbox or toolkit, which are typically stored away and used for specific tasks.

The word "safe" implies that there is a risk of harm, so it is likely that the bears are known to attack or pose a threat in some way. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence - "easily spooked" implies that the bears are more scared of the humans than the other way around, while "in danger" refers to the bears themselves being in danger rather than posing a threat to humans.

Question: John's know that friends didn't respect him. Every day he suffered what at their hands? Options: A: humiliate,B: belittlement,C: contempt,D: embarrassed,E: irreverence,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that John's friends did not treat him with respect, and that as a result he suffered something at their hands. "Belittlement" means to make someone feel small or unimportant, which fits the context of the sentence. "Humiliate," "embarrassed," and "irreverence" are all similar in meaning but do not precisely match the context of the sentence.

belittlement
Question: HOw do you describe a bad real estate agent? Options: A: stealing,B: exaggerate,C: incompetent,D: cover up,E: charming,. Knowledge: The question is asking for a negative characteristic of a real estate agent, and stealing, exaggerating, and covering up are all unethical or illegal behaviors that would not be associated with a reputable agent. Charming is a positive trait that a real estate agent might possess, so it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Incompetence, on the other hand, would lead to poor performance and negative outcomes for clients, making it a likely choice for a bad real estate agent. Answer is
incompetent

Aquariums are man-made places where fish can be kept, but not a location where they can be found in the wild. Answer is

Therefore, he compromised and placed it under something. The most likely option for this would be a table, as it is a common item that can be used to display objects, and it would also hide the rug from view to some degree. The other options do not have any clear relevance to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Question: Where do spirits haunt outside? Options: A: bar,B: funeral home,C: haunted house,D: liquor cabinet,E: cemetary,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that spirits are haunting a location that is outside, which rules out options like a bar or liquor cabinet.

Answer is
cemetary

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the act of continuously applying for jobs without receiving any responses can result in negative emotions. The phrase "no calls come back" suggests that the person is not being contacted for interviews or job offers, which can be disheartening and frustrating. The options "hope" and "happiness" are unlikely because the context implies a negative outcome. "Working hard" may be a result of the frustration, but it is not the direct consequence being described. Answer is
frustration
Question: You can use a stick to swat at what growing in a field? Options: A: woods,B: forest,C: bicycle spokes,D: home,E: grass,.

While computers are used in a variety of settings, including universities, labyrinths, and large cities, the most likely location for computer sorting is the post office. This is because the post office is responsible for sorting and delivering a large volume of mail and packages, which requires complex sorting systems that rely on computers. MIT is a prestigious university that is known for its technology programs, but the question does not provide enough information to suggest that this is the correct answer. Answer is
post office

This is a common understanding, as diets high in saturated fats and processed meats have been linked to heart disease, obesity, and other health problems. The other options (death, gas, McDonald's, nausea) are not necessarily direct consequences of eating hamburgers in excess, and therefore do not fit as the answer. Answer is
health problems

The other options do not necessarily relate directly to going to bed at 11 at night, as someone might relax or rest without necessarily going to bed, for example.

Question: Where would you see a conductor and performers singing in German? Options: A: subway,B: listen to music,C: orchestra,D: broadway,E: opera,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the conductor and performers are singing in German, and this is a clue that the correct answer is related to classical music. The options "subway" and "broadway" are not likely to be correct, as they are not traditionally associated with classical music. "Listen to music" is too broad and doesn't provide any specific information. The options "orchestra" and "opera" both seem plausible, but since the sentence mentions singing in German, "opera" is the more likely answer because operas are typically performed in their original language.

container

Answer is

Therefore, the most logical place for the fish to end up would be in a fish tank where they could continue to live in a controlled environment. Answer is
fish tank

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is reluctant to eat vegetables, and specifically mentions baked potatoes. In this context, "prepare" makes the most sense as an answer, as it implies that the person doesn't know how to cook or season vegetables properly. "Clean" and "wash" are unlikely answers, as potatoes are typically cleaned and washed before baking. "Grow" is also unlikely, as the person's reluctance to eat vegetables suggests that they are not interested in gardening. "Open mouth" is a non-sequitur and is clearly not a viable answer. Answer is
prepare

Knowledge: The sentence indicates that Indian restaurants can be found in many locations throughout the world. However, the answer option "more sophisticated town" lacks a clear connection to the context, while "curry" refers to a dish rather than a place. Therefore, the answer must be "large city," as cities typically have a larger population and a more diverse range of culinary options, including ethnic restaurants like Indian cuisine. Answer is
large city

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that if a person works hard, their situation will be improved, which likely means they will experience an improvement in their quality of life. Working hard can lead to better job opportunities or promotions, higher salaries, increased job security, and a sense of personal fulfillment. Compliments or acknowledgment may provide a boost to one's self-esteem, but they are not directly connected to improving one's situation. The American Dream is a concept, not a tangible outcome from hard work, and "headache" is not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Question: Which lawn do people not care about as much since people don't see it? Options: A: golf course,B: front yard,C: back yard,D: garden,E: suburbia,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people are less concerned with a certain lawn because it is out of view, which would likely refer to a back yard. Front yards are often a point of pride for homeowners and are visible from the street, making them an important part of curb appeal. Golf courses are typically well-maintained and visible to players and spectators alike. A garden may be important to its owner, but would not necessarily be overlooked by others. Suburbia is a place, not a lawn. Answer is
back yard

Question: When you fight inflation you expect to see what at stores? Options: A: lower prices,B: raise interest rates,C: more demand,D: more money,E: have money,. Knowledge: When inflation is present, prices tend to rise due to the decrease in the purchasing power of money. Fighting inflation usually involves measures that decrease the amount of money in circulation, which helps to control price increases. Therefore, we can expect to see lower prices at stores if a country or organization is successful in fighting inflation. The other choices do not make logical sense within the context of the question, as raising interest rates or increasing demand for goods could actually exacerbate inflation. Answer is
lower prices

Question: If you're spending too much time intensely jogging what can happen? Options: A: blisters,B: practice for mar-than,C: improved health,D: being tired,E: heart attacks,. Knowledge: The word "intensely" suggests that the jogging is being done at a demanding level, which can increase the risk of heart attacks. Intense physical activity can put a strain on the heart, especially in individuals who are not used to such activity or have underlying cardiovascular issues. Blisters may occur from excessive jogging, but they are not a life-threatening condition. While improved health is a potential benefit of regular exercise, the sentence is specifically referring to the negative consequences of too much intense jogging. "Practice for mar-than" is not a valid option. Answer is
heart attacks
Question: Where could you find out about a cow that does not exist? Options: A: story book,B: great outdoors,C: field,D: toy store,E: barnyard,. Knowledge: The question suggests that the cow in question does not exist in reality, meaning it can only be found in fictional sources such as story books. The other options (great outdoors, field, barnyard) all suggest real-life locations where one might find actual cows, and the option toy store suggests a toy cow, which still exists as a physical object. Therefore, the correct answer is story book. Answer is
story book
Question: Where can someone get information in audio? Options: A: book,B: article,C: television,D: meeting,E: newspaper,. Knowledge: The question is asking specifically for information in audio format, which is commonly found on television through news broadcasts, documentaries, and other programs.

Question: When seeing people play a game and your team is loosing what might you feel? Options: A: excitement,B: envy,C: stress,D: anxious,E: entertaining,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person's team is not doing well in the game, which can be a cause of stress and frustration.

The word "up" also implies that the target is at a higher level than Timmy. The most likely target in this scenario would be a porch, as newspapers are commonly thrown onto porches. The other options do not fit with the context of the sentence, as newspapers would not typically be thrown onto a library, jail, subway or floor. Answer is
porch

lower blood pressure
Question: Where could there be a battle that is not real? Options: A: vietnam,B: video game,C: court room,D: war,E: iraq,. Knowledge: The context indicates that the question is referring to a battle that is not real, which rules out options like Vietnam, Iraq or war as these are real-life situations where battles can occur. A court room battle may involve a conflict or a legal dispute, but it is not a physical battle. A video game, however, often involves virtual battles and conflicts that are created in a simulated world, making it the correct answer. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the location of the sink is in the bachelor's living space as it mentions that he didn't bother cleaning it. The options chemistry lab, front desk, and laboratory suggest a work or public space, which is unlikely to have a sink that the bachelor would be responsible for cleaning. The laundry room is also less likely as it is not mentioned that the bachelor does his laundry. This leaves us with the option of apartment, which fits with the context of the sentence as it is a common living space with a sink that would require regular cleaning. Answer is
apartment

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
wishing well

Knowledge: The question is asking for a place where John would take his lawnmower, which implies that he is looking for a tool or service to fix a mechanical problem with the lawnmower. Among the choices, only "repair shop" fits this description. The other options do not provide any useful service for fixing a lawnmower; a car dealership sells cars, a toolkit is a collection of tools and not a place where one can fix equipment, a bar is a place to drink and socialize, and a tool box is simply a container for tools. Answer is

Question: The mosquitoes were about to be crushed by a fly swatter, what would they do to survive? Options: A: spread disease,B: swamp,C: buzz off,D: bug campers,E: fly away,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the mosquitoes are in danger of being killed by a fly swatter, and it is implied that they need to do something to survive. "Fly away" is a realistic option for the mosquitoes because it is a natural defense mechanism that they possess. The other options are not realistic solutions for the mosquitoes' predicament. "Spread disease" is a negative consequence of mosquitoes, but it does not pertain to their immediate need for survival in this situation. "Swamp" and "bug campers" are not actions that mosquitoes are capable of taking, and "buzz off" is a phrase that implies leaving but does not give a specific action for the mosquitoes to take. Answer is
fly away

The word "staggering" specifically means to walk unsteadily or swaying from side to side, which fits with the context of the sentence. The other options (falling down, throwing up, getting arrested, turning into a butterfly) do not accurately describe the man's current state or match the context of the sentence. Answer is
staggering

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the Canadian traveler visited a location in the southwestern region. While Canada is mentioned as the traveler's country of origin, it is not a viable option since it is not located in the southwestern region. Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico are all states located in the southwestern region of the United States, but only New Mexico is a viable option since it is the only location mentioned in the sentence that the traveler actually visited. Peru is a country located in South America, so it is not a viable option either. Answer is

Knowledge: This question suggests that the person is preparing to go outside with knives, which is most commonly associated with activities such as camping, hiking, or survival. It is unlikely that someone would bring knives to a purse or a drawer, as they are not practical for outdoor activities. Sporting goods stores might sell knives, but they are not a place to put them before heading out.

Churchyards may also be surrounded by houses, but the sentence doesn't mention a church or any religious affiliation. The option "most cities" is too vague and doesn't provide a specific location. The options "ocean" and "field" are not likely places to find a cemetery surrounded by houses and businesses. Answer is

Therefore, it is logical to assume that he was still "trying" to break the record, rather than "leaving," "failing," "finishing," or "giving up." These other choices are all possible outcomes of the high jumper's attempt, but they do not directly answer the question of what he was doing to break the record. Answer is
trying

The other options, such as armored cars and the White House, do not make sense as potential sleeping locations for an active soldier. Answer is
tent
Question: Where is a jellyfish not likely to be? Options: A: pacific ocean,B: store,C: atlantic ocean,D: indian ocean,E: japanese restaurant,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that jellyfish are commonly found in certain locations, but not in others.

The other options are less likely as they do not relate to the pilot's job or location, such as a space shuttle (which is not as commonly flown as airplanes), a shower (which has nothing to do with the pilot's occupation), the sky (which is too broad of an answer), or an airplane (which is too general and does not specify where the pilot would be located within the airplane). Answer is

Knowledge: The word "competing" suggests that people are facing a situation where they have to fight for resources that are limited and cannot be shared by everyone. This can lead to a feeling of pressure, anxiety, and tension, which are all characteristics of stress. The other choices are not necessarily associated with the idea of competition, nor do they describe an emotional state that is commonly linked to it. "Defeat" and "aggression," for example, imply a more active response, while "winning or losing" and "confusion" do not necessarily capture the emotional dimension of competition. Answer is
stress
Question: When would you want to have food? Options: A: cook,B: eat,C: shop,D: burned,E: hungry,.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that elephants are captured and brought somewhere to live, which is commonly done for display purposes in zoos. While elephants may also live in circuses or be owned by private individuals in cities, the use of the word "captured" suggests that they are not there by choice and may be kept in captivity.

Africa is the natural habitat of elephants, but the question specifically asks about where captured elephants live. Answer is
zoo

A bridge is a structure used to cross over bodies of water or other obstacles, and would not be the correct answer in this context. Highway refers to a major road typically used for long-distance travel, and would not typically have a group of residences and stores.

"Remember names" is too specific and does not capture the full extent of the impact of meeting interesting people, while "friendly" and "cordial" describe personal behavior rather than the effects of social interaction. "Friendship" is also too specific and could imply a deeper connection than what is suggested in the sentence. Answer is
grow

Answer is

Question: Where do young people have to follow the rules during the day? Options: A: football game,B: everything,C: classroom,D: family situation,E: schoolbus,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a specific place where young people are required to follow rules during the day. The option "everything" is too broad and not specific to a physical location. Similarly, "family situation" does not fit the context of the sentence which refers to a location. While it is important for young people to follow rules during a football game, this only applies to the duration of the game, not necessarily the entire day. A school bus is only relevant during transportation to and from school. Therefore, the correct answer is likely the location where young people spend the majority of their day, which is almost always the classroom. Answer is
classroom

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker was in a location where people were focused on exercise and that it was likely a community or public place. Resort hotels may have pools, but the tone of the sentence suggests that the focus was exercise rather than leisurely activities. California and school do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Kitchen is an unlikely location for a swimming pool. The YMCA, on the other hand, is a community organization that often provides recreational facilities, including swimming pools, for its members who are interested in fitness and exercise. Answer is

"Go to jail" is completely unrelated, "sleepover" could potentially provide warmth but doesn't directly address the issue of raising body temperature when chilly, and "burns" and "damage" are not safe or effective methods of raising body temperature. Answer is

"Fighting" is not a valid option as it doesn't relate to the effect of the bully's words on others. Answer is

Additionally, the sentence mentions that he scoured the place many times searching, which indicates that he was meticulously searching a large area.

The phrase "he must think" implies that this behavior is intentional, and the phrase "have a comment to share" suggests that the person has something to say about everything.

The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well. Answer is

A hardware store is a more likely option, as they carry a variety of chains for various purposes.

Question: What method of transportation uses air to float? Options: A: surface of earth,B: supermarket,C: train station,D: space shuttle,E: balloon,. Knowledge: The question asks for a method of transportation that uses air to float, which immediately eliminates the options of surface of earth, supermarket, and train station.

Question: Sam thought that Jane was mean, but she was actually what? Options: A: kindness,B: nice,C: generous,D: friendly,E: mean cruel,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam's perception of Jane was different from her actual personality. The opposite of "mean" would be something positive, such as "nice" or "kind."

The options "cruel" and "mean cruel" are also opposites of Sam's initial perception, but they are redundant and do not provide any additional information. Answer is

Question: Where is the closest place you would find a potato? Options: A: ireland,B: kitchen cupboard,C: england,D: chicken,E: maryland,.

The other options, such as Ireland or England, may have a historical or cultural association with potatoes, but do not necessarily indicate a location where a potato can be found easily.

In the context of playing soccer, losing can be particularly upsetting as it often entails putting in significant physical and mental effort without achieving the desired outcome.

While a wristwatch or purse could be places where one might keep a calculator, the sentence refers to doing math at work, making an office or desktop a more likely option. The specific mention of an accounting department might lead some to choose that option, but it is too specific and narrow to fit the context of the sentence. Answer is

Question: Where would a bell end a scheduled class? Options: A: church,B: boat,C: school,D: educational institution,E: front door,. Knowledge: The word "class" suggests that we are referring to a learning environment, and the word "scheduled" implies that this is a regularly occurring event. The option "church" is unlikely since bells are more commonly associated with religious practices. The option "boat" also seems unlikely since it is not a common practice to use bells to signal the end of a class on a boat, and the other options are more likely. The option "educational institution" is too broad and could refer to a variety of settings other than a school, which leaves the option "front door" and "school". While bells may also be used at a front door or entrance, it would be more appropriate to use a bell to signal the end of a class within a school building since it is a traditional and commonly accepted practice in many schools. Answer is
school

Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the measurement had to be adjusted, which implies that it was not quite accurate to begin with. The phrase "just right" suggests that the adjustment needed to be relatively small in order to achieve the desired outcome. Therefore, out of the choices given, 'slight' is the best answer to describe the type of increase needed. 'Mighty' implies a large increase, 'negligible' suggests that the adjustment would have had little effect, 'useless' and 'petty' are not appropriate modifiers for the word 'increase' in this context. Answer is
slight

Watching and looking around are similar in meaning and suggest that you have an opportunity to take in your surroundings.

The word "trying" suggests that the person was met with resistance from their parents when trying to explain why stopping their marriage was the right thing to do.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy has a positive association with singing because it allows him to do something specific.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the man liked to eat hamburgers but did not exercise, which can lead to a caloric surplus and weight gain. The other options are not directly related to the context of the sentence - gas could be a possible result of eating hamburgers, but it is not specific to the man's situation.

"Enjoy" is not a result of eating hamburgers and not relevant to the context of the sentence. Answer is
gain weight

Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking about a place where a human could go to be close to their deceased ancestors. The option "graveyard" is the most obvious choice as it is a place where the remains of deceased individuals are buried, and where people often go to pay their respects to their ancestors. The options "civilisation," "underground," "spacecraft," and "space shuttle" do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
graveyard

Options: A: win elections,B: re elected,C: bribe,D: power,E: the majority vote,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James was a politician who lacked integrity and would take things that he shouldn't have, indicating that he may have engaged in corrupt activities such as accepting bribes.

The other options do not fit as well with the context of the sentence. Answer is

Question: Where do people go if they are looking for a taxi? Options: A: apartment,B: street corner,C: space shuttle,D: public place,E: garden,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that people are searching for a mode of transportation or a ride somewhere, and street corners are typically where taxis or other forms of public transportation can be found.

Question: Where might someone live if they are only able to have a small dog? Options: A: dog show,B: manhattan apartment,C: tree,D: farm,E: neighbor's yard,. Knowledge: The question is asking about a living situation that would only accommodate a small dog. Based on common living spaces in urban areas, a Manhattan apartment is a likely choice. Apartments in urban areas are often small and have limited space for pets, so a smaller dog would be more practical. The other options are not realistic choices for living with a dog.

Answer is
manhattan apartment

Options: A: stammering,B: maundering,C: speechless,D: talking,E: tongueless,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Ben had difficulty reading the words on the teleprompter, which likely caused him to stumble over his words and speak less smoothly than usual. The word "eloquent" implies that Ben is usually a skilled speaker, which makes "stammering" the most likely choice since it describes someone who speaks with difficulty or hesitation. The other options either do not accurately describe the situation or are simply nonsensical. Answer is
stammering

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that having two dogs can quickly lead to having more, which is likely due to their ability to reproduce. Dogs are known to be sexually active and can mate with other dogs to produce offspring. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Barking and needing food are normal behaviors for dogs, while the idea of dogs owning people or making playmates is not supported by the evidence provided. Answer is
reproduce

Options: A: stare at computer screen,B: compile,C: get frustrated,D: write code,E: think logically,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person is struggling with the computer program and is likely experiencing negative emotions as a result. The phrase "beginning to" suggests that the person's frustration is a new development in the situation. Staring at the computer screen and thinking logically are not necessarily indicators of frustration, and compiling and writing code are specific actions that do not necessarily reflect the person's emotional state. Therefore, "get frustrated" is the most appropriate answer. Answer is
get frustrated

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that driving a car can become boring or repetitive, implying that the driver may want to do something to alleviate this feeling.

listen to radio

Being in close proximity with strangers would make it easier for passengers to meet new people and potentially make friends. The other options such as motion sickness, disorientation, and bad food are all negative aspects of traveling on a cruise, and getting somewhere more quickly is not mentioned in the sentence as a benefit of choosing a cruise. Answer is
meeting new people

Question: Where would you find a shark that is not alive? Options: A: great barrier reef,B: deep ocean,C: maritime museum,D: ocean,E: pool hall,. Knowledge: The question suggests that the shark being referred to is no longer alive and is on display somewhere. The option "great barrier reef" does not make sense as sharks that are no longer alive would not be found there. "Deep ocean" and "ocean" are also unlikely as it would be difficult to display a dead shark underwater. "Pool hall" does not fit the context of the question. "Maritime museum" is the most appropriate option as it is a common place where preserved marine life specimens are displayed. Answer is
maritime museum
Question: By laughing while playing, what were the children doing? Options: A: learning,B: getting tired,C: injuries,D: having fun,E: winning,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the children were laughing while they were playing, which indicates that they were enjoying themselves. Laughing is typically associated with happiness and enjoyment, which makes "having fun" the most likely answer. "Learning" and "winning" may be things that happen while playing, but they do not necessarily indicate that the children were having fun in the moment. "Getting tired" and "injuries" are also possible outcomes of playing, but they do not relate to the children's emotional state while they were playing. Answer is
having fun

Options: A: apartment,B: house,C: bedroom,D: motel room,E: bathroom,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Billy was trying to clean up water that was splashing onto the floor from an overflowing toilet. Typically, toilets are located in bathrooms, so it is likely that the toilet in question in this sentence is also located in a bathroom. The other options do not make sense in this context - an apartment, a house, a bedroom, and a motel room can all contain bathrooms, but they do not specify that the toilet is located in a bathroom. Answer is
bathroom
Question: What could prevent someone from starting to dance? Options: A: becoming tired,B: sore feet,C: sweat,D: wearing beads,E: having fun,. Knowledge: The other choices listed do not necessarily prevent someone from starting to dance. Becoming tired or sweaty may make someone less likely to continue dancing, but it would not necessarily prevent them from starting. Wearing beads or having fun are unlikely to be obstacles to dancing. Sore feet, on the other hand, would make it uncomfortable or painful to dance, which could prevent someone from beginning to dance in the first place. Answer is
sore feet
Question: What's a good way to remember your small dog after he's gone? Options: A: movies,B: photograph,C: basket,D: laboratory,E: school,.

photograph
Question: The shark was feeling cold, what did it decide to look for? Options: A: ocean,B: tropical waters,C: sea world,D: tomales bay,E: great oceans,. Knowledge: Sharks are cold-blooded animals, meaning that their body temperature is regulated by the temperature of the surrounding water. Therefore, if a shark is feeling cold, it would likely look for warmer waters to swim in. The options "ocean," "sea world," "tomales bay," and "great oceans" do not specify a particular temperature or climate that would necessarily warm up the shark. "Tropical waters," on the other hand, explicitly suggests warmer waters, making it the most appropriate choice. Answer is
tropical waters
Question: Where do you stock weaponry? Options: A: machine gun,B: fishing rod,C: tin can,D: artillery,E: double in worth,.

Additionally, the phrase "double in worth" does not make sense in the context of the question. Answer is
artillery

Knowledge: The question is asking about the basic action that an actor performs while performing on stage or in front of a camera. The correct answer is "pretend," because acting involves creating a believable portrayal of a character, situation, or emotion that is not actually happening in the actor's real life. The other options (branch out, eat curry, wear costume, sing songs) may be activities that are associated with acting in some way, but they do not accurately describe the main purpose or action of an actor. Answer is
pretend

Knowledge: A greenhouse is a specific type of structure that is designed for growing plants. It is common to have pots with live plants in a greenhouse, as the controlled environment allows for optimal growing conditions. The other answer choices are unlikely to have a pot with something alive in it. A kitchen drawer and closet are not suitable environments for a living plant, while a cupboard may have pots but not necessarily with something alive in them. A restaurant may have pots with plants for decoration, but they would not be kept in a pot in the main dining area. Answer is
greenhouse
Question: After being stuck indoors all day breathing fresh air would lead to what? Options: A: feeling better,B: oxygen intake,C: think more clearly,D: happiness,E: feeling refreshed,.

While the other options may also be true, they are not the most specific answer to the question. Answer is

The choices "deny," "doubt," "disbelief," and "paranoid" all suggest a more active or reactive stance against the thing in question, whereas "skepticism" connotes a more cautious and measured approach. Therefore, "skepticism" is the best choice for the mindset that prevented him from accepting it. Answer is
skepticism

Knowledge: The sentence mentions that John's doctor suggested that he needed to take better care of himself, which indicates that some physical activity would be beneficial for his health. The sentence also suggests that skating is not John's favorite activity, but he still prefers it over other options. The doctor's recommendation and the fact that skating involves physical movement suggest that the activity might have a positive impact on John's overall health. The option "increased heart rate" is the most likely effect of skating that could benefit his health, while the other options (move fast, might fall, injuries, hurt him) are all negative outcomes that could occur during the activity. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the question was not responded to, which means the person chose to not acknowledge or respond to it. The option "ignore" directly fits this context. The other options do not make sense in this context, as "ask" and "question" imply the person is the one posing the query, not the one responding to it. "Answer" doesn't fit either, as it suggests the person provided a response, which is contradicted by the sentence. "Mute" also doesn't fit, as the sentence doesn't mention any technological or electronic devices. Answer is
ignore

This means that they would want to get a potato straight from where it was grown before it is transported to other places.

Question: What might someone not caught killing someone have? Options: A: a conviction,B: going to jail,C: guilty conscience,D: retribution,E: criminal trial,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone did not get caught for killing someone. In this context, it is unlikely that they would have a conviction or go to jail, as those are consequences of being caught and found guilty of a crime.

The option 'spare room' is the only choice that matches this description, while the other options refer to a bedroom (on their bed), or various names for a shared living space (livingroom, living room, sitting room), which would not typically be used as a designated guest room.

While serving food is also part of the job, it is not the action being described in the sentence. Tipping may be relevant to the job, but it is not an action that the person is described as having to listen to. Writing and washing hands are not related to the context of the sentence at all. Answer is

"Inside" suggests a closed or confined space, while "Greece" refers to a specific location rather than the type of environment an amphitheater provides. "Experiencing performance art" is too general and could apply to various types of venues, not specific to an amphitheater. "Park" could be a plausible option, but it is not as specific as "outside." Answer is
outside

It suggests that the bill aimed to encourage companies to lower their prices, but failed to achieve this goal. While raising interest rates and higher interest rates are generally associated with combating inflation, they are not relevant to the context of this particular sentence. Saving money and selling more products may be related to corporate goals, but they do not align with the purpose of the bill as described in the sentence. Answer is
lowering prices

The options "listen to music," "play games," and "eat ice cream" don't address the issue at hand, and don't seem like appropriate solutions to help with someone's mental health. The option "have fun with" is too vague and doesn't provide any clear indication of how this might help with mental issues. The option "talk" is the most logical choice because it suggests that individuals with mental issues need someone to talk to in order to express their feelings and receive support. Answer is

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Using roads would be a given for someone going for a walk, and having a slim waist or the best things in life are not practical or necessary for going on a walk.

comfortable shoes

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the bald eagle escaped from somewhere, and then made its nest in a location where it wouldn't be easily reached. The nesting location is described as a place that requires the bird to fly or climb to, which suggests a high altitude. Therefore, a cliff would be the most plausible option as it is a natural environment for eagles to build nests at high elevations. The other options do not fit the requirements for the eagle's nesting location described in the sentence. Answer is
cliff

Gear shifts and saloons do not typically have chains to drive their wheels, and while tow trucks may use chains to pull vehicles, they do not have a mechanism for driving their own wheels. Jewelry stores have nothing to do with the context of the sentence. Answer is
motorbike

"Pick up" in this context means to work additional hours to make up for those lost, whereas the other options do not necessarily have a connection to the context of the sentence.

Shovelling is a common method used to remove snow from driveways, so it is the most appropriate answer. The other options are not relevant to the situation described in the sentence.

Out of the given options, only car and bus fulfill this criteria. However, a space shuttle is not a common over-the-road transport and a computer screen cannot be ridden.

That means they may need more information or clarification about what they are supposed to do. Therefore, the correct answer is "ask," since this is the best way to ensure that the person being commanded has a clear understanding of what is required of them.

Question: Ryan answered the call, but the person on the other end did what? Options: A: talk,B: whisper,C: response,D: hanging up,E: communicate,.

The phrase "hanging up" suggests that the person abruptly ended the call, which is the correct answer. The other choices could also apply, but they do not match the specific action described in the sentence. Talking, whispering, and communicating are all actions that someone can do while on a call, but there is no indication that the person did any of these things. Similarly, "response" is too vague and does not suggest a specific action the person took. Answer is

The other choices do not make sense in this context. Flapping arms and flying is impossible for humans, completing high school and talking to each other do not address the issue of crossing the water, and dying suddenly is not a solution to the problem. Answer is
cross river

"Careful" and "save money" may be relevant to the couple's financial situation, but are not directly related to purchasing a house.

On the first day of school, people often want to reconnect with old friends they haven't seen during the summer break and make new friends too.

meet friends

The choices "spiritual" and "incorporeal" describe ideas that are not physically tangible, so they do not fit the context of the sentence.

Based on this information, the most likely destination for the banjo would be a music store, which is a typical place for consumers to buy musical instruments. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence - the United States is too general, an office would usually not be a place where musical instruments are sold, and a jug band is a type of musical group, not a store.

"Vomit" and "prepare" are not reasonable options based on the context of the sentence. "Say grace" is also unlikely, as it does not relate to the child's behavior around food. Answer is

The option "they cannot took for sleeping and travelling" is not a valid answer as it does not make sense grammatically. Answer is

Question: Where is an expressway likely to be crowded? Options: A: country,B: canada,C: michigan,D: michigan,E: large city,. Knowledge: Expressways are highways designed for high-speed, high-volume traffic flow in urban areas. Cities are often more densely populated than rural areas, which means there are more people using the roads, leading to congestion and traffic jams. Canada and Michigan are not specific enough to suggest whether expressways are likely to be crowded or not, while "country" is too broad and doesn't have any specific connection to expressways. Therefore, the correct answer is "large city." Answer is
large city

Answer is

asking for money

The other options do not necessarily make sense as immediate reactions to sadness.

The option "baseball" is a specific sport that often requires players to wear jerseys, further supporting the answer choice. The other options, such as "town" or "city", are not related to sports or apparel. "Retail shopping district" is too general and does not provide any specific information to help answer the question. Answer is

The other options do not provide a clear explanation for what the device connected to the TV might be. Answer is

Options: A: learn more about,B: headache,C: do math,D: enlightened,E: better understanding,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the scientist is analyzing the data from the lab results. The phrase "better understanding" is the only option that fits with this context, as the scientist is likely analyzing the data to gain a deeper comprehension or insight into something. The other choices do not make sense in this context: "learn more about" is redundant since the scientist already has the lab results; "headache" and "do math" are nonsensical; and "enlightened" is too philosophical and unrelated to the scientific process. Answer is
better understanding

Knowledge: The term "dirt highway" suggests a rural or less developed area where the roads may not be paved. The word "countryside" is the only option that fits this description. "Atlas" refers to a book of maps and has no relevance to the context of the sentence. "Repairs" and "in the city" do not fit the rural setting suggested by "dirt highway." "United States" is too broad and does not provide any specific information about the location of a dirt highway. Answer is

Knowledge: Fictional words are typically found in works of fiction, such as novels, short stories, and poetry. While newspapers may contain some creative writing, they are primarily focused on reporting factual information. The mouth and sentence options do not make sense in the context of finding fictional words. "In the package" is too vague and does not provide any clear connection to the question. Answer is
books
Question: The school dress code was strict, all girls had to wear a what? Options: A: pants,B: trousers,C: pant,D: long skirt,E: naked,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the school dress code for girls was strict and required a specific type of clothing. The option "pants" and "trousers" are unlikely to be the correct answer because they are typically associated with male clothing, and the sentence specifically mentions "girls." "Pant" is an incorrect spelling of "pants." "Naked" is clearly incorrect and inappropriate for a school dress code. Therefore, "long skirt" is the most likely correct answer. Answer is
long skirt
Question: With elderly resident, Illness is a common way a stay ends where? Options: A: hospital,B: sick person,C: grave yard,D: nursing home,E: brain,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the elderly resident is staying somewhere and that illness is a common way for their stay to end. The most likely place for an elderly resident to stay is in a nursing home, as they provide care for seniors who need assistance with daily living activities.

"Brain" is also unrelated to the sentence. Answer is
nursing home

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there will be consequences if you fail to file your taxes, which typically involves paying money that you owe. The option "get money" does not make sense in this context since the government is not acquiring money, but rather, you are being required to pay. "School children" and "serve public" are not related to taxes at all. "Forgive you" is unlikely since the government generally does not forgive unpaid taxes. The most reasonable option is "take money" since the government can enforce penalties and fines for failing to file taxes, which involves taking money from you. Answer is
take money
Question: where does a homeless person go for food? Options: A: homeless shelter,B: sanctuary,C: park,D: bridge,E: bus depot,. Knowledge: Homeless shelters are typically known as places where homeless individuals can go to receive basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing. In contrast, a sanctuary is typically thought of as a place of refuge or safety, but not necessarily one that provides food. Similarly, parks and bridges are not typically associated with providing food to those in need. Bus depots may offer some food options, but it is not their primary function. Answer is
homeless shelter

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person was tired after a day of work and needed to rest during their lunch break. The options "go to bed", "get physical activity", and "earth" do not make sense in this context, while "have rest" and "sleep" are more appropriate options.

Answer is
sleep
Question: Expressing yourself by using complicated words and technical language is likely to draw what from you audience? Options: A: communication,B: getting arrested,C: stage fright,D: blank stares,E: applause,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that using complex language is not an effective way to communicate with an audience, as it is likely to cause confusion and disengagement. "Blank stares" is a common response to language that is difficult to understand, while "applause" is an unlikely response in this context. "Getting arrested" and "stage fright" are also unrelated to the topic of language use. Answer is
blank stares
Question: If you want to stop being married to someone it's usually because of what? Options: A: lying,B: trouble,C: civil authorities,D: lawyer,E: judge,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that someone wants to end their marriage, and the word "usually" suggests that there is a common reason for this. The most common reason for wanting to end a marriage is due to trouble or issues within the relationship, such as infidelity, incompatibility, or irreconcilable differences. The other options do not make sense in the context of the sentence- lying may be a specific reason for wanting to end a marriage, but it is not usually the primary reason. Civil authorities, lawyers, and judges may be involved in the process of ending a marriage, but they are not the reason for it. Answer is
trouble
Question: The food was packaged for sale, where was it bound? Options: A: bathroom,B: shelf,C: kitchen,D: refrigerators,E: shop,.

The only reasonable option is a shop. Answer is
shop
Question: Where would you get an upright piano if you do not have one? Options: A: new york,B: living room,C: music room,D: music store,E: house,. Knowledge: The question asks where one could obtain an upright piano, which is typically purchased from a music store. The other options (such as a living room or house) do not make sense as they are not places where pianos are typically sold or found. New York could potentially have a music store, but it is not inherently connected to the question and therefore less likely to be the correct answer. Answer is
music store
Question: If someone suffers from hunger but has nothing in the house what do they have to do? Options: A: eat breakfast,B: buy food,C: have lunch,D: call a friend,E: eat hamburger,. Knowledge: The question suggests that the person is in need of food but does not have any available in their house. This implies that they need to acquire food from an outside source, which eliminates the options of eating breakfast or having lunch (as they would need food to make these meals). Calling a friend may provide some support or assistance, but it is not a direct solution to the problem of hunger. Eating a hamburger also requires acquiring the food, but it is not the best choice as it limits the options to only one type of food. Buying food provides the most practical and necessary solution to the problem of hunger. Answer is
buy food
Question: WHat causes a kid to cry when riding a bike? Options: A: peddling,B: peddle,C: stopping,D: falling off,E: pedaling,. Knowledge: Falling off a bike is a common and potentially painful experience for a kid who is learning to ride. Children may feel scared, embarrassed, or physically hurt after taking a spill, and crying is a natural response to these emotions. Peddling and pedaling are variations of the same word, which refers to the act of moving the bike forward by turning the pedals with your feet. Stopping is a normal part of riding a bike, and should not cause a child to cry unless there is some other factor involved (such as fear of falling or frustration with the process). Answer is

Answer is
toolbox

Knowledge: The question is asking where a good place in a home is to keep an extra eyeglasses case, implying that the case is not currently being used. Keeping it in a bag or shirt pocket would suggest that the glasses are being carried around, which is not relevant to the question. Keeping it on a desk or in a car would suggest that it is being used regularly, which is also not relevant to the question. Therefore, the best option is a drawer, which would allow for easy storage and retrieval of the case when needed. Answer is
drawer
Question: What state should your bedroom have before sleeping? Options: A: place to sleep,B: darkness,C: tired,D: closing eyes,E: ohio,.

Answer is

Playing hockey or basketball can be exciting, but they require access to specialized equipment and locations.

Dancing, on the other hand, is a fun and engaging physical activity that can be done in a variety of settings and does not require specialized equipment. Therefore, the correct answer is dance. Answer is
dance

This activity is commonly referred to as an English hunt, making it the most likely choice among the options provided. Burrowing typically refers to animals, such as rabbits or badgers, and wouldn't be relevant to fox hunting. A hen house is where chickens are kept and wouldn't be associated with fox hunting. A polo game is a completely different sport that involves playing on a horse but doesn't involve hunting. A rural area, while it may be where foxes are present, does not provide an activity for a horse rider to participate in. Answer is
english hunt

One is that it dates back to ancient times when people believed that a sneeze could expel evil spirits from the body. Saying "bless you" was a way of protecting the person from any lingering negative effects. Another theory is that it originated during the bubonic plague in the Middle Ages, when people believed that sneezing was a symptom of imminent death.

Knowledge: Mats are typically placed on floors as a means of protecting the surface beneath them from dirt, water, or other debris. Bathrooms may have mats near the shower or bathtub, but they are not typically referred to as "mats." Kitchen mats may be used near the sink or stove, but the kitchen is not generally associated with mats.

The mention of a baby likely means that the adults were hoping for the baby to fall asleep so that they could have some quiet time to themselves.

Question: Where can a student find their pens? Options: A: art class,B: backpack,C: school,D: office,E: take notes,.

Question: What is a human adapted to handle? Options: A: co2,B: community,C: population,D: diverse situations,E: school,. Knowledge: Humans are adaptable creatures that have the ability to adjust to different environments and situations. This suggests that the correct answer is something that humans are equipped to handle. "CO2" (carbon dioxide) is a gas that humans exhale and while important for plant life, it is not something humans are specifically adapted to handle. "Community" and "population" are social structures and not things that humans have evolutionary adaptations for. "School" is a man-made institution and not something that humans have innate adaptations for. Therefore, "diverse situations" is the best option because it suggests the ability to handle a range of different circumstances, which is something that humans are biologically capable of doing. Answer is
diverse situations

Knowledge: While love can be expressed in many ways, having sex is commonly associated with romantic relationships and is often seen as an intimate expression of love between two consenting adults.

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that learning about the world and how it works may have a negative consequence. The phrase "loss of innocence" often refers to a realization or awareness of the darker side of life, which can be a result of gaining knowledge about the world. The other choices, such as pleasure, laughter, and anger, do not match the negative connotation of the sentence. Sadness could be a possibility, but loss of innocence is a more specific and common phrase used in this context. Answer is
loss of innocence

The other options, such as delicious food, self esteem, compliments, and eating dinner, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
acquire wealth

Knowledge: The sentence implies that there is a process called smelting that involves minerals located in the countryside, and that this process results in the creation of a specific item.

The other options either do not have any connection to smelting or are too general to provide a clear answer. Answer is

Supermarkets are large grocery stores that sell a variety of food items and household products, making them the most likely place to find potato chips for sale.

Knowledge: The question suggests that the kids are interested in going outside to check the weather, so the correct answer would involve an action that allows them to exit the house. Of the options given, only "open door" fits that description. Sitting down, counting marbles, and wondering about the weather would not help the kids determine what the weather is like outside, and becoming adults is not a practical solution for the immediate problem described in the question. Answer is
open door
Question: In the 1940's what happened when a radio show decided to pretend the Earth was invaded by Martians? Options: A: eat cake,B: laughter,C: daydreams,D: religion,E: people believe,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that something unexpected happened when a radio show pretended that the Earth was invaded by Martians in the 1940s.

people believe
Question: It was a long hard day of work, it was now time for sitting down and what? Options: A: relaxing,B: sleep,C: listened to the voices in their heads,D: pee,E: watch tv,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after a long, hard day of work, it is now time for the speaker to take a break and do something restful. The option "relaxing" fits this context because it implies activities that are calming and restful, such as reading, meditating, or taking a warm bath. The other options, such as "sleep" or "peeing," might also be necessary after a hard day of work, but they don't necessarily convey the idea of relaxation. "Listen to the voices in their heads" is a nonsensical option in this context, and "watch tv" is too specific and not necessarily indicative of relaxation for everyone. Answer is
relaxing
Question: There is a giant enemy crap.  It is too big to fit though doors.  So it is stuck where? Options: A: virginia,B: cape cod,C: make person sick,D: fish market,E: outside,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the giant enemy crab is too big to fit through doors, indicating that it is located inside a building or structure. The only option that is not a location is "make person sick," which is not related to the context of the sentence. Virginia and Cape Cod are specific locations that do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. Fish market could be a possibility, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is "outside," as the crab is likely stuck outside of a building or structure due to its size. Answer is
outside

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person wanted to make a statement about their financial success by choosing a flashy car. Flashy cars tend to be expensive and are often associated with wealth and luxury.

Answer is
expensive

Knowledge: The sentence implies that adult Americans have a routine that involves going to a specific place outside of their home, which is likely related to their employment. The option "work" fits this description, while the other choices do not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Tent" and "foreign" are unlikely places for frequent visits, while "apartment" and "the office" are possible alternatives, but "work" is a more general and commonly used term that encompasses different kinds of work environments. Answer is
work
Question: Where is there likely to be sadness in a waiting room? Options: A: hospitals,B: airport,C: clinic,D: in a marriage hall,E: doctor's office,. Knowledge: Waiting rooms in hospitals are commonly associated with negative emotions such as sadness and anxiety, as people often wait there to receive bad news or to visit sick loved ones. In contrast, waiting rooms in airports or marriage halls are typically associated with positive or neutral emotions, as people are usually traveling or celebrating. Clinics and doctor's offices may also be associated with negative emotions, but they are not as commonly associated with sadness as hospitals. Answer is

Question: What could bringing suit do to a rivalry? Options: A: going to court,B: randomness,C: anger,D: aggravation,E: tensions,. Knowledge: The word "suit" suggests legal action, such as bringing a lawsuit against someone.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
aggravation

Options: A: pleasure,B: indigestion,C: convenience,D: spills,E: feel guilty,. Knowledge: The sentence states that Billy likes his clean sheets too much, which suggests that the reason he doesn't eat breakfast in bed that often is because he is worried about spilling food and staining his sheets. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Question: James and Holly were getting a divorce. They didn't like it, but they needed it.  What might they be trying to avoid? Options: A: being single,B: tears,C: children suffer,D: anger,E: no spouse,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that James and Holly are getting a divorce despite not liking it, which suggests that they have a reason for ending their marriage. The phrase "they needed it" suggests that the divorce may be a difficult but necessary decision to avoid a worse outcome. The option "children suffer" is the most likely choice because divorces can be hard on children and it is common for couples to try and minimize the negative impact on their children during a divorce. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
children suffer
Question: The competitive guy liked to play games, what was his goal? Options: A: entertaining,B: dice,C: win,D: bored,E: relax,.

Question: Steam turns to vapor quickly when it is exposed to what? Options: A: condensate,B: rain,C: liquid water,D: ice,E: cold air,. Knowledge: The question asks what causes steam to quickly turn into vapor, which could suggest that the steam is being cooled down. Cold air, therefore, seems like the most likely option since it would lower the temperature of the steam and cause it to rapidly condense into water vapor. The other options do not fit well with the context of the sentence or do not make sense in relation to the scientific properties of steam. Answer is
cold air
Question: Where is an adult collector of toy cars likely to keep them? Options: A: toy store,B: block of flats,C: own home,D: childs bedroom,E: child's room,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the collector is an adult, meaning they likely have their own home to store their collection.

own home
Question: Where can I put the bean bag chair so that everyone can use it? Options: A: sofa,B: floor,C: family room,D: person's home,E: house,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the bean bag chair is a shared object, and the word "everyone" suggests that it should be placed in a communal area where multiple people can use it. The options "sofa" and "floor" are not ideal choices as they suggest a single person's seating arrangement rather than a shared space. "Person's home" and "house" are too general and do not provide any specific location within the home. "Family room" is the best choice as it is a common area that is typically shared by all members of a household. Answer is
family room
Question: Where do kids throw a ball around? Options: A: street,B: playground,C: loud,D: gymnasium,E: bowling alley,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the activity of throwing a ball around is typically associated with a place where kids can play freely and safely, suggesting a playground. Streets may be too busy and pose a danger to children, while loud and gymnasium are not typically associated with ball games. A bowling alley is not specifically designed for outdoor sports, and is not a typical location for throwing a ball around. Answer is
playground
Question: What place protects animals such as the bald eagle? Options: A: farm,B: nature preserve,C: soup,D: canada,E: mountainous area,. Knowledge: The question implies that there is a place where animals are protected, and the specific mention of the bald eagle suggests that it is a type of bird or animal that requires protection. A farm is not typically associated with animal protection, and soup is obviously not a place. Canada is a country and mountainous areas are not necessarily places that protect animals. A nature preserve is a specific type of protected area that has been established to protect wildlife and their habitats, making it the most appropriate answer. Answer is
nature preserve
Question: The forward comes before an essay, what comes at the end of it? Options: A: last word,B: afterword,C: epilogue,D: conclusion,E: page numbers,. Knowledge: In an essay, the forward is typically an introductory section that comes before the main body of the essay. Therefore, it makes sense that the section that comes after the essay would be a concluding section, commonly referred to as the conclusion. This section is used to summarize the key points of the essay and bring the discussion to a logical end. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence as well – last word suggests a single word rather than a section, afterword and epilogue are typically used in books rather than essays, and page numbers are irrelevant to the structure of an essay. Answer is
conclusion
Question: If you live by the shore than you probably live in a what? Options: A: desert,B: picture of sea side,C: california,D: seaside town,E: ocean,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that living by the shore is a characteristic of a specific type of location. The correct answer is likely to be an option that is associated with living close to the ocean or sea. "Desert" is not associated with living near the shore, and "picture of sea side" is not a real location. "California" is a state that has many seaside towns, but it does not specifically refer to living by the shore. "Ocean" is not a location where people live, but rather a body of water. Therefore, the best answer is "seaside town." Answer is
seaside town
Question: Sarah wants to eat lunch.  To do this she'll have to go to her kitchen and do what? Options: A: smell,B: have food,C: get food,D: hungry,E: buy food,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that Sarah doesn't currently have food readily available for lunch, since she needs to go to her kitchen in order to eat. Therefore, the correct answer would be "get food", since Sarah needs to grab or prepare something to eat. The option "smell" does not make sense in this context, while "have food" assumes that Sarah already has food on hand. "Hungry" is a state of being and not an action, and "buy food" is not mentioned as an option for Sarah in this particular sentence. Answer is
get food
Question: Sunshine and warmth are the weathers associated with what? Options: A: alaska,B: summer,C: disneyland,D: beach,E: meadow,.

Question: Bob the mouse lived in a densely populated area.  Where might he look for shelter? Options: A: kitchen,B: corn field,C: abandoned houses,D: shed,E: desktop,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Bob the mouse lived in an area with many other mice or potentially humans, indicating a more urban or developed area. Abandoned houses are often found in such areas and may provide shelter for rodents like mice. The other choices, such as a corn field or desktop, do not seem like viable options for shelter in a densely populated area. Answer is
abandoned houses
Question: James thought that cost of buying the new screen outweighted the what? Options: A: retail markup,B: revenue,C: for free,D: income,E: benefit,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that James did not think the cost of buying the new screen was worth it. The word "outweighed" implies that there was some sort of negative consequence or disadvantage to buying the screen. Since the other options do not fit this context, the correct answer is likely "benefit," as James did not see enough advantages or benefits to justify the cost. Answer is
benefit
Question: The food fresh of the grill was the best in town, it was no surprise that this place was many people's favorite what? Options: A: restaurant,B: backyard,C: barbeque,D: back yard,E: neighbor's house,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the food being referred to is prepared on a grill, which is a common cooking method at restaurants. The other options, such as backyard or neighbor's house, do not make sense in this context as they are not usually associated with commercial food preparation. Barbeque or back yard are similar to restaurant, but the word "restaurant" is the most appropriate choice as it implies a professional setting where food is prepared and served to customers. Answer is
restaurant
Question: The animals had eaten and taken a mud bath in the sun, what happened to them as a result? Options: A: feel pleasure,B: die of cancer,C: procreate,D: baked,E: pass water,.

Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the peanuts were being sold at a specific location during a specific time period. The most likely location for this to occur is at a ballpark during a baseball game, as it is a common snack to be sold at these events. The other options, such as a carnival or grocery store, may also sell peanuts, but they do not fit the specific context of the sentence. Answer is
ballpark
Question: Where do people perter to have linoleum on the ground? Options: A: mobile home,B: house,C: kitchen floor,D: shed,E: furniture,. Knowledge: Linoleum is a type of durable flooring material that is commonly used in kitchens because it is easy to clean and maintain.

Question: Sometimes when people think some wrongdoing has ocurred in government, how do they react? Options: A: talk to each other,B: cook food,C: demand justice,D: learn from each other,E: share food,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that people who believe wrongdoing has occurred in government will react in a certain way. The phrase "demand justice" is an action that can be taken in response to perceived wrongdoing. The other options, such as "cook food" and "share food," do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence and do not convey a sense of reaction or response to perceived wrongdoing. The option "talk to each other" could be a possible response, but it is too general and does not specifically address the issue of perceived wrongdoing in government. Answer is
demand justice
Question: What will likely happen to one's body if the only eat hamburgers? Options: A: get full,B: make money,C: hungry,D: choking,E: getting fat,. Knowledge: Hamburgers are typically high in calories, fat, and sodium, which can lead to weight gain if consumed in excess. This is supported by research that shows a link between fast food consumption and obesity. The option "get full" is not specific enough as one can get full from various other foods as well. "Make money" and "choking" do not make logical sense in this context. "Hungry" is unlikely as hamburgers contain protein, which can make one feel full for longer. Answer is
getting fat
Question: The salesman was a weasel, this should've probably been expected at a what? Options: A: used car lot,B: viking ship,C: chicken coop,D: backyards,E: rabbit warren,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the salesman was untrustworthy, which is a common stereotype associated with used car salesmen. A "weasel" is also often used to describe someone who is sneaky or deceitful, which further supports the idea of a used car salesman. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
used car lot
Question: Bob walks up to the second floor to his bedroom, where is he? Options: A: house,B: office building,C: hotel,D: school,E: hotel,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that Bob has a bedroom on the second floor, which is a common feature of houses but not necessarily other types of buildings. Offices and schools typically have multiple floors with multiple rooms, while hotels usually have rooms on multiple floors but not specifically assigned to an individual guest like a bedroom in a house. The repetition of "hotel" as a choice is likely a mistake and can be eliminated as a valid option. Answer is
house
Question: The inspector labeled the vessel water-tight on the dock, where was it's next destination? Options: A: sky,B: human body,C: streets,D: ocean,E: port,. Knowledge: The term "vessel" suggests that we are talking about a boat or ship. Since the inspector labeled it as water-tight, it is safe to assume that it is meant for travel on water. The choices "sky," "human body," and "streets" are not logical next destinations for a boat. The option "port" could be a possible destination, but it is not as specific as "ocean," which is where the majority of boats travel to. Answer is
ocean
Question: what other species have blood other than humans? Options: A: vampires,B: person,C: soccer game,D: capillaries,E: animals,. Knowledge: The question asks for other species that have blood besides humans, which implies that humans are one of the species that have blood.

Animals, however, are a diverse group of living organisms that all have blood as part of their anatomy. Answer is
animals
Question: After a person celebrates an occasion for hours on end, what might the person experience? Options: A: hangovers,B: being happy,C: drinking,D: becoming tired,E: nirvana,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the person has been celebrating for hours, which suggests that they may have expended a lot of energy during that time. Additionally, the word "experiences" implies that the person is feeling a certain sensation or emotion, which would rule out options like nirvana and drinking. Hangovers are typically associated with consuming alcohol, which may or may not have occurred during the celebration, but the sentence does not provide enough information to determine whether this is a likely outcome. Being happy is a possibility, but the sentence specifically asks about a physical sensation, not an emotional one. Therefore, becoming tired is the most likely answer. Answer is
becoming tired
Question: Where do you keep a piano? Options: A: concert hall,B: church,C: restaurant,D: drawing room,E: music room,.

Bowling alleys, on the other hand, are unlikely to have either pencils or a high concentration of young people. Answer is
classroom
Question: Where would you go if you need a hardware store? Options: A: washington,B: sears,C: small town,D: oregon,E: canada,. Knowledge: Sears is a well-known department store that often carries hardware and home improvement items.

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the person in question did not realize that consuming too much of a supposedly "good" thing could actually be harmful. This suggests that the word used to describe the substance in question should connote health or wellness. Both "nutrient" and "vitamin" are commonly associated with a healthy diet, and either could be considered "essential" in certain contexts. "Antidote" and "medicine" both suggest a substance that is taken to counteract a negative effect, which does not fit the context of the sentence. "Consumable" is a broad term and does not provide enough specificity to determine whether it is a correct answer. Answer is
nutrient
Question: After getting wet cotton clothing may suffer from what? Options: A: shrinkage,B: shiver,C: not dry,D: mildew,E: getting cold,. Knowledge: When cotton clothing gets wet, it tends to shrink due to the natural properties of the fabric. This is because cotton fibers contract when they come into contact with water, causing the clothing to become smaller in size. The other options do not accurately reflect the common consequences of getting cotton clothing wet - shiver and getting cold may be associated with being wet, but they do not relate to the material itself, while not drying and mildew are outcomes of leaving wet cotton clothing for a long time, rather than a direct result of getting it wet. Answer is
shrinkage
Question: The rural general store is a staple of the great nation called what? Options: A: towns,B: salt,C: canada,D: america,E: small town,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the rural general store is a characteristic feature of a nation. The options "towns" and "small town" are too broad and not specific enough to identify a particular nation. "Salt" is unrelated to the context of the sentence. Canada is not referred to as "the great nation" in common parlance, while America is often referred to as such. Therefore, "America" is the correct answer. Answer is
america

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam was able to easily access a deli for lunch, which indicates that the deli was located nearby. Specifically, it was located on the ground floor of a building. The options "town", "shopping center", and "strip mall" do not specify that there is a building involved, while "New York City" is too broad and does not provide enough information to determine where the deli was located. Therefore, "office building" is the most fitting choice. Answer is
office building

The other options do not fit within the context of the sentence.

Knowledge: Signs that give direction while moving fast are typically seen on roads or highways where a driver needs to quickly determine which way to go. A freeway is a type of highway where drivers often need to make quick decisions based on signs, so it is the most likely answer choice. A fork in the road may have signs, but it does not necessarily involve moving fast, so it is not the best answer choice. A demonstration, jogging, and state park do not have any connection to the context of the question. Answer is
freeway

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Sam had difficulty falling asleep, which is often associated with wakefulness. The other options do not accurately describe Sam's condition. "Stay awake" implies that Sam chose to remain awake, while "exhausted" suggests that Sam was tired and would naturally be able to fall asleep. "Being awake" simply restates the original problem, while "bed" is not a condition but a location where Sam attempted to sleep. Answer is
wakefulness
Question: The driver forgot his glasses, he was having trouble judging distance of oncoming cars and wouldn't pull out thinking they were all what? Options: A: close,B: closeness,C: proximity,D: near,E: measured in meters,. Knowledge: The sentence states that the driver had trouble judging the distance of oncoming cars, which means that he was having difficulty with objects that are close to him. Therefore, the correct answer would be "near," which indicates a short distance. Additionally, the other choices, such as "closeness" and "proximity," refer to the concept of being close, but they do not directly address the issue of distance. "Measured in meters" also does not fit the context of the sentence, as it is a unit of measurement rather than a description of how close or far something is. Answer is
near

Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is asking where glue is commonly used. The options "desk drawer" and "cabinet" are too general and do not provide any indication of where glue would be used. "School" could be a possible answer, but it is still too broad. "Closed container" is a possible location to store glue, but it is not where glue is used. "Art room" is the most specific and appropriate answer, as glue is commonly used in art projects and activities. Answer is
art room

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the reason for the members' death was due to their belief in something, which likely influenced their decision to drink the poison.

believed

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person did something bad unintentionally and apologized afterwards, indicating a sense of regret or remorse. Therefore, the person's apology would be considered genuine and heartfelt, which is often associated with sincerity.

sincere
Question: The skeleton for this needs to be light so it can fly? Options: A: building,B: aircraft,C: ship,D: closet,E: closet,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object being discussed needs to be able to fly, which limits the options to things that can fly, such as aircraft. Additionally, the use of the word "skeleton" suggests that the object is a type of structure or framework, further narrowing down the options to those that typically have a skeleton-like structure, such as buildings or aircraft. However, the mention of it needing to be light suggests that buildings or ships are less likely options, as they typically require a lot of weight to provide stability. The second mention of "closet" is likely a typo and can be disregarded. Answer is
aircraft

The most logical option for where he would leave his key would be at the hotel where he was staying. The other options, such as a bus depot or a pub, do not make sense as places where someone would leave a room key. James also wouldn't leave his key in his own home if he was staying at a hotel. Answer is

Question: Where would you find a dentist office along side other such providers? Options: A: medical center,B: metropolitan city,C: patient,D: main street,E: bathroom,. Knowledge: A medical center is a location where multiple healthcare providers are housed, including dentists. The phrase "alongside other such providers" suggests that the dentist office is located in a larger complex or building that houses other healthcare professionals. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence - a metropolitan city has many different types of businesses and facilities, a patient is a person seeking medical treatment rather than a location, main street is a common road name that could refer to any number of businesses, and a bathroom is obviously not a location for a dentist office. Answer is
medical center

Question: I was craving Tyson chicken but didnt have any where did i acquire more? Options: A: bought at store,B: found in grocery store,C: drove around,D: eaten,E: chopped,. Knowledge: The verb "acquire" implies gaining something through a deliberate action, which rules out options like "found" or "driven around."

Knowledge: The context of the sentence indicates that the children gathered around a campfire, which is a common setting for storytelling. Additionally, the other options do not make as much sense in the context of a campfire. Playing with toys or playing house would require a different setting, such as a playroom or a backyard. Playing games or playing ball would also be difficult around a campfire due to safety concerns. Hearing stories is the most logical option that fits the context of the sentence. Answer is
hear stories
Question: Where can I find a steakhouse with a view of canyons? Options: A: nebraska,B: mexico,C: new york,D: utah,E: japan,. Knowledge: The sentence specifies that the person is looking for a steakhouse with a view of canyons.

deception

Options: A: antipathy,B: indifferent,C: recollect,D: being mean,E: negligence,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person responsible for the patient's care was not paying attention to their duties and was distracted by their cell phone. This behavior implies a lack of care or concern for the patient, which aligns with the definition of negligence. Antipathy and being mean are more related to intentional actions rather than neglectful ones. Indifference implies a lack of emotion or concern, but not necessarily negligence in caregiving. Recollect means to remember, which does not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
negligence

Knowledge: After a game, athletes need to allow their bodies to rest and recover from the physical exertion they just underwent. Resting allows the body to repair any damage caused during the game and helps to prevent injuries. Taking steroids is not recommended for athletes, as it is a form of cheating and can have negative health effects. Playing sports or engaging in other vigorous physical activity immediately after a game may also be detrimental to an athlete's recovery. Walking fast or cycling forever may not provide the necessary rest and recovery time that an athlete needs. Answer is
need to rest
Question: Someone who is facing boredom will often be told to go out and do what? Options: A: mind games,B: have fun,C: go somewhere,D: entertain,E: watch film,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that boredom can be remedied by engaging in an activity that is enjoyable. "Have fun" is the most straightforward and contextually appropriate choice. "Mind games" may be an option in some cases, but it doesn't fit the tone of the sentence. "Go somewhere" and "watch a film" could be ways to have fun, but they aren't as broad as "have fun" and may not apply in all situations. "Entertain" is a vague option that doesn't provide any clear direction. Answer is
have fun

A mobile home typically has a functional, compact layout with simple furnishings, which matches the description in the sentence. The other options, such as a kitchen floor or furniture, are not large enough to be considered a place of residence, while owning land or living in a traditional house would not necessarily imply the characteristics mentioned in the sentence. Answer is
mobile home
Question: Where would you find only one churchyard? Options: A: village,B: city,C: england,D: canada,E: michigan,. Knowledge: The phrase "only one churchyard" suggests that the location being referred to is a small, contained area, rather than a large city or country. A village is a small community, often rural or semi-rural, and may have only one churchyard. The other options, such as city or country, are less likely, as they are usually too large or too varied for there to be only one churchyard. England and Canada may have many villages, but the location being referred to is not specified as being in any particular country or region. Michigan, as a state in the USA, is also too broad a location to be the correct answer, and is not mentioned in the question. Answer is
village

"Make patchwork quilt" and "play chess" are unrelated to accessing news or solving the problem of boredom. Answer is
surf net
Question: what are the kind of transport that is used underwater in the atlantic ocean? Options: A: earth,B: basin,C: whales,D: submarines,E: planet,.

The other options are not related to transportation or underwater travel in any way. Answer is

The options "hold secret" and "store food" do not make sense given the context.

"Hold things" is a general option that could also work, but "store clothes" is more specific and directly related to the context. Answer is
store clothes

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the hikers were tired and needed a break. The phrase "have rest" suggests that they stopped to take a pause and relax for a bit, rather than sleep or take a nap which imply more prolonged periods of rest. "Sit down" could also be a possible answer, but it does not necessarily convey the idea of resting. "Go to bed" and "sleep" are too extreme and not practical in a hiking context. Answer is
have rest
Question: What dirty method of getting from one place to another in large cities may not allow you to see daylight? Options: A: ground,B: subway,C: over bridge,D: street,E: race track,.

Knowledge: The sentence implies that pewter has a unique characteristic that sets it apart from other metal alloys. The word "softness" suggests that pewter is comparatively malleable and pliable compared to other metals, which is a sought-after quality for certain types of crafts and decorative objects.

Sitting down on a log is a common way to take a rest while hiking, and it is not likely that they would choose to read a book or go to sleep in this context. "Run out of steam" is an idiom that means to lose energy or motivation, but it does not fit the context of the sentence as well as "have rest" does. Answer is
have rest

Knowledge: The sentence explicitly states that this person has lots of friends, which is often an indicator of popularity. Accomplishing goals, getting laid, and receiving compliments may also contribute to popularity, but they are not directly mentioned in the sentence as factors that would indicate this person's level of social status. Being busy does not necessarily correlate with having many friends, so it can be ruled out as the correct answer. Answer is
popularity

Question: The peanuts were sealed for freshness, so where were they placed? Options: A: jar,B: peanut shells,C: carnival,D: ballpark,E: bought at grocery store,. Knowledge: The fact that the peanuts were sealed for freshness implies that they were placed in a container that can be tightly sealed, which eliminates the options of peanut shells, carnival or ballpark. The last choice suggests that the peanuts were purchased from a grocery store, which is possible, but does not provide information on where they were placed after being bought. Therefore, the most logical choice would be a jar, which is a common container used to store food items and can be sealed to maintain freshness. Answer is
jar

Question: His friend insisted that he must, but his conscience stopped him as he knew that he what? Options: A: unnecessary,B: optional,C: will not,D: need not,E: should not,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person had a conflict between what his friend wanted him to do and what his conscience was telling him. The phrase "stopped him" implies that his conscience prevailed and he did not do what his friend wanted. The options "unnecessary" and "optional" imply that the action was not important or required, which does not fit the context of the sentence. "Will not" and "need not" imply that the action was not possible or necessary, which also does not fit the context. Therefore, "should not" is the best choice as it implies that the person felt a moral obligation not to do what his friend wanted. Answer is
should not

Knowledge: The sentence implies that people need to do something in order to obtain food, and the most common way to do so is by working for it. People often work in order to earn money and then use that money to buy food. The other options are not logical choices for obtaining food; growing your own food is a possibility, but it is not clear from the sentence whether this is an option available to everyone, and purchasing food from a specific website (webvan.com) is not relevant or realistic. Browsing and shopping are not actions that directly result in obtaining food. Answer is
work for
Question: A person who has been killing people should have what done by the police? Options: A: terrible,B: get arrested,C: commended,D: die,E: going to jail,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person in question is a murderer, which is a crime punishable by law. The correct answer would be that the police should arrest them. The other options do not make sense in this context. "Terrible" is an adjective and doesn't describe an action that should be taken. "Commended" means to praise or congratulate someone, which is not appropriate for a person who has been killing others. "Die" is not something that the police should do to the murderer, but rather a consequence of their actions. "Going to jail" is similar to "get arrested," but the latter is the immediate action that police would take, while the former is the inevitable consequence of it. Answer is
get arrested

Knowledge: Tropical seas are known for their warm waters and are often the site of tropical storms and hurricanes. The other options do not have a clear connection to warm waters and storm formation. The Arctic, for example, is known for its cold temperatures and would not be a likely place for a storm caused by warm waters. The weather report and America are too general and do not provide any specific information about the location of the storm. Answer is
tropical seas
Question: She grabbed the handle very tightly to work out the knots, she began to what? Options: A: juggling,B: brush,C: carry purse,D: umbrella,E: saucepan,.

The other options, such as juggling or carrying a purse, do not make sense in the context of the sentence. Answer is
brush

The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
bowling alley
Question: What might learning about science  lead to? Options: A: new ideas,B: experiments,C: invent,D: accidents,E: atheism,. Knowledge: Learning about science involves gaining knowledge about the natural world, which can lead to discovering new ideas and theories. Scientists often use their knowledge to develop new hypotheses, conduct experiments to test them, and invent new technologies. While accidents can occur during scientific experiments, it is not a guaranteed outcome of learning about science.

The context of the sentence also implies that it should be stored within the office, rather than being purchased or borrowed from an external source like an office supply store or campus book store.

desk drawer

The other options do not match the context of the question: a scrap heap is a place where discarded materials are stored, a manual is a book of instructions, a parking garage is a multi-level building for parking cars, and a repair shop is a place where cars are fixed. Answer is
driveway

A park is a common destination for families on nice days, as it provides open space for children to play and families to picnic or relax in nature. Answer is
park

The term "pantry" is commonly used to refer to a small room or cupboard where food items are stored, particularly non-perishable items like canned goods, pasta, and cereal. The other options do not fit the context of the question - a trunk is usually associated with transportation and not food storage, a supermarket is where groceries are purchased rather than stored, a sink is used for cleaning dishes rather than storing food, and a shelf could be anywhere in the house and does not necessarily imply food storage. Answer is
pantry

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person needs to pass a class in order to stay on a team. To pass a class, they need to do well on tests and complete homework assignments.

Answer is
low crime

Desktop is the best choice as it refers to the place where a computer mouse would typically be found. The other options, such as abandoned houses or corn fields, have no clear connection to a computer mouse. Cupboard and cabinet could be potential choices, but desktop would be the most commonly used term in this context. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the recipe originally called for a lot of salt to enhance the flavor, but the person making the dish has dietary restrictions that require them to use less salt. Using "too little" or "very little" would suggest that the dish lacks flavor, while "too much" or "too few" would not make sense in the context of the sentence. "Little bit" suggests a compromise between the need for flavor and the need for moderation in salt consumption. Answer is
little bit

This helps to protect the surrounding environment and equipment from damage. Therefore, the correct answer is space shuttle as it is the only option that is associated with launching into space. The other options, such as Disneyland, electrical circuit, washing machine, and sink, do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
space shuttle

Answer is
honor

Additionally, ficus plants are commonly kept as houseplants, which makes "own home" the most likely answer. "Good health" does not make sense in this context, and "park" is an unlikely place to keep a personal plant. Answer is
own home
Question: He appreciated the small park and its taste of nature, living in the city just felt so what? Options: A: very hard,B: city,C: man made,D: indoors,E: artificial,. Knowledge: The sentence contrasts the small park with the city, suggesting that the city is seen as being the opposite of natural. It describes the city as feeling "so" something, which implies a negative connotation. The options "city" and "man made" both describe the urban environment but do not directly address the negative feeling. "Very hard" might be interpreted as a possible answer, but it does not fit as well with the contrast between the park and the city as "artificial" does.

artificial

Capital punishment (the death penalty) is a possible sentence in Texas for murder or certain other crimes, including stabbing someone to death. Imprisonment is also a possible sentence, but the question specifies that the consequence is likely to involve a more severe penalty. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
capital punishment
Question: If someone has a strong feeling of greed and wants to make some quick money what might they try to do? Options: A: play poker,B: dominate world,C: advance into battle,D: conquer opponent,E: make friends,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is looking to make quick money, which is often associated with gambling. Poker is a popular card game that involves betting and can potentially yield significant earnings with skill and luck. Dominating the world, advancing into battle, and conquering an opponent all suggest a desire for power or victory rather than a focus on making quick money. Making friends is unrelated to the context of the sentence. Answer is
play poker
Question: How does god want one another to treat others according to the bible? Options: A: call them names,B: everywhere,C: care for people,D: work in life,E: speak to people,. Knowledge: The Bible teaches us to love one another and to treat others as we would like to be treated. This includes caring for people, showing kindness and compassion, and putting the needs of others before our own. Calling people names and speaking to them disrespectfully goes against these teachings, so those options can be eliminated. "Everywhere" and "work in life" do not make sense in the context of the question, leaving "care for people" as the most appropriate answer. Answer is
care for people
Question: Why would a person be happy about an accident? Options: A: found a penny,B: hurt people,C: not harmed,D: harm others,E: make mistakes,. Knowledge: The word "happy" suggests a positive feeling, so the answer must be something that is positive. "Found a penny" and "make mistakes" are not related to accidents. "Hurt people" and "harm others" are obviously negative outcomes of an accident, so they cannot be the correct answer. Therefore, the only realistic option that could lead to happiness in the aftermath of an accident is if the person involved was not harmed. Answer is
not harmed
Question: What is likely to happen to a driver with an open sunroof during  rainstorm? Options: A: common cold,B: spinal injuries,C: splats,D: getting wet,E: exhilaration,. Knowledge: An open sunroof during a rainstorm is likely to result in the driver and passengers getting wet. This is because raindrops can easily enter the car through the open sunroof. None of the other options are related to getting wet, and they do not make sense in the context of a rainstorm and an open sunroof. Answer is
getting wet
Question: His hatred drove him, he rose through the ranks and eventually led the soldiers to the end game of doing what? Options: A: judge,B: fight enemy,C: killing,D: advance into battle,E: conquer opponent,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person mentioned in the sentence had a strong motivation, which was fueled by his hatred, to rise through the ranks and eventually lead soldiers to achieve some goal. The options "judge" and "fight enemy" are not likely to be the end game as they seem incomplete in the context of the sentence. "Killing" is too broad and could be applied to any military action. "Advance into battle" is also incomplete and not clearly definitive. "Conquer opponent" is a logical end goal in the context of military leadership and the motivating factor of hatred. Answer is
conquer opponent
Question: You loose water in your body while playing sport because of what? Options: A: good health,B: pain,C: fatigue,D: sweating,E: injuries,. Knowledge: Sweating is the body's natural response to regulate temperature during physical activity. As you exercise, your body produces heat and sweat to cool down, which results in water loss. Good health is not related to water loss during exercise, while pain and injuries are potential side effects of playing sports but not necessarily related to water loss. Fatigue is a possible result of dehydration caused by water loss but it is not the direct reason for it. Answer is
sweating
Question: How can people acquire things they desire? Options: A: riots,B: wait in line,C: suffer pain,D: bank money,E: believe in god,. Knowledge: Bank money is a common way for people to acquire things they desire, as they can use it to purchase goods and services. Riots and suffering pain are not typically productive ways to acquire things, and waiting in line may be necessary in certain situations but is not a reliable way to acquire everything. Believing in god may provide emotional comfort and support, but it is not directly related to acquiring material possessions. Answer is
bank money
Question: When you clean clothes what do you need to put in the washer? Options: A: soap,B: take off,C: sort,D: read labels,E: use water,. Knowledge: When cleaning clothes in a washing machine, it is necessary to add soap in order to break down dirt and stains from the fabric. The other options are not directly related to the washing process - "take off" implies removing clothes, "sort" refers to organizing clothes by color or fabric type, "read labels" is important but not a necessary step for adding soap, and "use water" is obvious but not the only thing needed for a proper wash cycle. Answer is
soap
Question: Where can you expect to find items made of fabric that adorn one's body? Options: A: sewing room,B: drawers,C: tailor shop,D: clothes store,E: clothing store,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the items made of fabric are wearable, so they would likely be found in a store that sells clothing. The options "sewing room," "drawers," and "tailor shop" refer to places where clothing may be created or stored, but not necessarily sold to consumers. "Clothes store" is a less common term for a store that sells clothing, while "clothing store" is a more commonly used term. Answer is
clothing store
Question: What causes fear in skating? Options: A: injuries,B: increased heart rate,C: might fall,D: can't stop,E: move fast,. Knowledge: Skating involves balancing on a thin blade of metal while gliding on ice, which can be precarious and lead to falls. Fear of falling is a common fear in skating because falling can result in injury or embarrassment. The other options may also be associated with skating, but they do not specifically address the fear that the question is asking about. Answer is
might fall
Question: The bookshop only sold specialty items, so where should someone go for popular books? Options: A: shopping center,B: department store,C: student union,D: mall,E: school,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the bookshop specializes in niche or uncommon items, so someone looking for popular books may need to go to a store that carries a wider selection. Department stores typically have a larger variety of products, including books, and may cater to a broader audience than a specific bookshop. The other options, such as a student union or school, may not have a bookstore or may not have a large selection of books available to the public. Answer is
department store
Question: Where would you put an electric razor to protect it from water? Options: A: bathroom,B: k mart,C: medicine cabinet,D: man's suitcase,E: refrigerator,. Knowledge: The question is asking for the best place to store an electric razor to protect it from water, which suggests that water could damage or ruin the razor. The most logical choice is a medicine cabinet, as it is commonly located in a bathroom and provides a dry, enclosed space to store personal items. The other options do not offer the same level of protection from water damage. Answer is
medicine cabinet
Question: It was dark and wet and only got worse the deeper they went, but they wanted to find the passageway to where the bats lived in the what? Options: A: batman,B: jungle,C: maze,D: cave,E: airport,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the characters are exploring a dark and damp environment, which is commonly associated with a cave. The mention of bats also supports this idea, as bats are often found in caves. The other options, such as batman, jungle, maze, and airport, do not fit the context of the sentence and are not associated with the description of the environment. Answer is
cave
Question: Where can you watch information on lizards? Options: A: on the back of a cereal box.,B: costa rica,C: garden,D: documentary,E: captivity,. Knowledge: The question asks where to watch information on lizards, suggesting that the answer will be related to a source of information. The other options, such as on a cereal box or in a garden, do not seem like viable sources of information on lizards. Costa Rica and captivity may be relevant to the study of lizards, but they do not provide a clear answer to the question of where to watch information on them. A documentary, on the other hand, is a common source of educational content and would likely provide detailed information on lizards. Answer is
documentary
Question: The monkey didn't touch the ground.  He jumped around, laughed, threw things, and had all sorts of fun, but he never left something. What did he never leave? Options: A: branches,B: brazil,C: playful mood,D: rain forest,E: treetops,. Knowledge: The sentence clearly states that the monkey never touched the ground, and the other options do not fit that criteria. Branches are connected to trees and would require the monkey to touch them, Brazil has no clear relevance to the sentence, a playful mood is not something the monkey physically interacts with, and the rain forest is a general location where the monkey may have been jumping around. Therefore, treetops is the only option left that fits the sentence's description of the monkey never leaving something. Answer is
treetops
Question: After stopping being married to a person you no longer love, what emotion may you experience? Options: A: depression,B: grief,C: relief,D: anger,E: wrong,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person is no longer in love with their partner, indicating that the marriage was likely causing them some degree of unhappiness or dissatisfaction. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that ending the marriage may bring a sense of relief. The other options may also be associated with ending a marriage, but they are not as directly linked to the specific condition mentioned in the question stem. Answer is
relief
Question: When a company wants to let people know about upcoming deals and offers, what do they do? Options: A: branch out,B: call,C: own factory,D: pay employees,E: mail clients,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the company wants to inform people about their offers, which suggests communication with clients. The options "branch out" and "own factory" are not related to communication with clients. "Call" and "pay employees" may be possible ways to communicate, but they do not specifically address letting people know about upcoming deals and offers. Therefore, the best answer is "mail clients." Answer is
mail clients
Question: Joe wasn't prepared to wage war. He had not raised what? Options: A: weapons,B: asserting power,C: plans,D: energy,E: armies,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that Joe was not ready to engage in a large-scale conflict, which suggests that he did not have a military force or armies at his disposal. The other options may be important factors in preparing for war, but they do not directly relate to having an army. For example, having weapons, plans and energy are all important, but they are not necessarily sufficient on their own to wage war. Asserting power may be important in certain contexts, but it does not necessarily imply preparation for war. Answer is
armies
Question: How do people show appreciation after they enjoy a show? Options: A: jump,B: clap,C: smile,D: feel happy,E: watch television,. Knowledge: Clapping after a show is a commonly accepted form of showing appreciation and acknowledgement for the performers. It is a gesture that indicates approval, enjoyment, and gratitude.

clap
Question: What is someone trying to get by going to bed? Options: A: rest,B: making love,C: insomnia,D: gold,E: pregnancy,. Knowledge: Going to bed is commonly associated with sleeping, which is a time for the body to rest and recover from the day's activities. Rest is often considered a necessary component of overall health and wellbeing, which may explain why it is the most likely answer in this context. The other options do not have any clear connection to the purpose of going to bed. Answer is
rest
Question: Where do nurses work with older people? Options: A: park,B: clinic,C: doctor's office,D: nursing home,E: hospital,. Knowledge: Nurses who work with older people often work in nursing homes, which provide long-term care for elderly patients who require assistance with daily living activities. While nurses may also work in clinics or hospitals, these settings are not exclusively focused on caring for older patients. Parks and doctor's offices are unlikely locations for nurses to work with older people. Answer is
nursing home
Question: Where would bacteria be contained? Options: A: finger,B: ground,C: septic tank,D: mouth,E: petri dish,. Knowledge: Bacteria are microorganisms that can be harmful to humans if they spread outside their designated environment. A septic tank is a system that is designed to contain and break down human waste, which can potentially contain harmful bacteria. The other options (finger, ground, mouth, petri dish) are not typically associated with containing bacteria in this context. Answer is
septic tank
Question: In order to read a book what must you do to it? Options: A: open up,B: learn to read,C: choose one,D: get comfortable,E: have time,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that in order to read a book, there is a specific action that one must take first. The answer choice "open up" directly addresses this action, indicating that you must physically open the book to begin reading it. The other choices are either unrelated or too general to specifically address the action required to read a book. Answer is
open up
Question: Where might a small dog spend a nice day? Options: A: backyard,B: own home,C: basket,D: bed room,E: dog show,. Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the focus is on a small dog spending a nice day, indicating a leisurely activity. While the other options may be possible places for a small dog to spend time, the word "nice" in the sentence implies a positive, enjoyable experience. The backyard is a common place for dogs to relax, play and enjoy the outdoors, making it the most likely answer. The other options, like "basket" or "bed room," are more likely associated with sleeping or resting. "Dog show" is not a suitable answer since the sentence does not mention any activity or event. Answer is
backyard
Question: Though the negotiation was hard, the two sides found a solution that was what? Options: A: hexachord,B: bearable,C: food,D: agreeable,E: easy,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that despite the difficulty of the negotiation, the two sides were able to reach a solution that worked for both parties. The word "agreeable" means pleasing or acceptable, which fits well with the context of the sentence. The other options do not make sense in the context of a negotiation between two sides. Answer is
agreeable
Question: The middle of a trip comes after the what? Options: A: left right,B: first,C: top,D: conclusion,E: beginning,. Knowledge: The phrase 'middle of a trip' implies that there is a beginning and an end to the trip. If we consider the trip to be a linear progression, then the middle would come after the beginning and before the conclusion or end. This eliminates options like left and right, which do not have any connection to the context of the sentence. First and top also do not make sense in this context, as they refer to a specific point in the trip rather than a general position in relation to the beginning and end. Answer is
beginning
Question: Danny was meeting his friend James, but James didn't show up. James was always punctual.  As time wore on and it became clear that his friend wasn't coming, Danny began to do what? Options: A: cheer,B: panic,C: anger,D: relaxation,E: joy,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that Danny was expecting James to be on time, but when James didn't show up and time passed, Danny started to feel distressed. The clue that James is "always punctual" suggests that Danny had a reasonable expectation of James showing up on time, which makes it more likely that his absence would cause worry or panic. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence or would be unlikely emotions in this situation. Answer is
panic
Question: Where is the most likely place for more than one stadium? Options: A: college town,B: large city,C: conducting olympic games,D: greece,E: rome,. Knowledge: Large cities are often home to multiple sports teams and therefore have a higher likelihood of having multiple stadiums. College towns may have one or two stadiums, but not typically more than that. Conducting Olympic games may result in temporary stadiums being built, but not necessarily permanent ones. Greece and Rome may have historical stadiums, but the question does not specify a time period and therefore is not necessarily relevant to the current day. Answer is
large city
Question: Some people believe that eating a heavy meal before going to sleep at night will cause you to what? Options: A: eat cake,B: restlessness,C: have nightmares,D: go to sleep,E: snore,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a belief that eating a heavy meal before going to sleep can have negative consequences. One of the more common beliefs is that it will cause nightmares. This belief may stem from the fact that digestion can be more difficult when lying down, leading to discomfort and potentially disturbing dreams. The other options are not directly related to this belief. Answer is
have nightmares
Question: What is someone not legal to buy alcohol? Options: A: underage,B: banned,C: adult,D: rules,E: black market,. Knowledge: The question is referring to a restriction on purchasing alcohol. The legal drinking age in most countries is 21 years old, so anyone younger than that would not be allowed to buy alcohol legally. The other choices, such as "banned" or "black market," do not relate to a legal restriction on buying alcohol but rather to other types of prohibitions or illicit sales. "Adult" and "rules" are too generic and do not provide enough context to determine the correct answer. Answer is
underage
Question: Where would you put a ficus if you want to protect it from the rain? Options: A: arboretum,B: ground,C: apartment,D: california,E: home,. Knowledge: The question suggests that a ficus needs protection from the rain, indicating that it is a plant that may not thrive in wet conditions. Therefore, it is appropriate to choose a location where the ficus can be shielded from the rain. Among the options, an apartment provides shelter from the rain because it is an indoor space. In contrast, the other choices do not offer sufficient protection, as an arboretum is an open garden, the ground is exposed to the elements, California is a state with varied weather conditions, and home could refer to an outdoor or indoor location. Answer is
apartment
Question: The vet was concerned about all of the blood he saw, where was the blood coming from? Options: A: person,B: animals,C: hospital,D: battlefield,E: soccer game,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions a vet, which suggests that the blood is likely coming from animals. Additionally, the sentence implies that the vet's concern is related to the amount of blood they saw, which makes sense if they were working with animals experiencing a significant injury or health issue. A hospital or battlefield may also have blood, but in those contexts, it would not necessarily be unusual or alarming to see large amounts. A soccer game is highly unlikely to produce significant amounts of blood. Answer is
animals
Question: What happens when someone is driving their car for a long time? Options: A: wheels turning,B: lack of fuel,C: tire wear,D: low on gas,E: transportation,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that after driving for a long time, something happens to the car. "Wheels turning" and "transportation" are too general and do not provide enough context or specificity to be the correct answer. "Lack of fuel" and "low on gas" are specific to running out of fuel, which is not necessarily implied in the sentence. "Tire wear" is the most likely answer as driving for a long time can cause the tires to wear down, especially if the driver is not regularly checking the tire pressure or alignment. Answer is
tire wear
Question: where can someone get a new chess set? Options: A: kitchen,B: toy store,C: michigan,D: cupboard,E: dorm,. Knowledge: A chess set is typically sold as a game or toy, not found in typical household areas like the kitchen or cupboard. A toy store would be the most appropriate place to purchase a new chess set. Michigan and dorm are unlikely choices as they don't provide any indication of where one can purchase a chess set. Answer is
toy store
Question: What do children often do to express happiness? Options: A: sing,B: play games,C: start fighting,D: fiddle,E: spread,. Knowledge: The word "express" suggests that the answer choice should involve an action that conveys emotions or feelings. Singing is a common way for children (and people in general) to express happiness or joy. Playing games could also be an answer, but it is a more general activity that could be done for many reasons beyond just expressing happiness. Starting a fight, fiddling, and spreading do not have any connection to the context of the question. Answer is
sing
Question: The helm is the steering control for what which pulls shipping barges through bodies of water? Options: A: sailing vessel,B: tugboat,C: motorboat,D: ship,E: ferry,. Knowledge: The sentence specifically mentions "shipping barges" which suggests that the answer will involve a type of vessel used for towing or pulling these barges. Tugboats are specifically designed for this purpose and are commonly used in harbors and other bodies of water to assist in maneuvering larger vessels. The other options may have steering controls, but they are not primarily built for towing or pulling shipping barges. Answer is
tugboat
Question: I need to pick up a balloon after getting some snacks and a cake, where can I get all these things at once? Options: A: fair,B: child's hand,C: sky,D: birthday party,E: grocery store,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the speaker needs to purchase multiple items, including snacks, a cake, and a balloon. A grocery store is the most likely option to have all of these items available in one place. The other options are not suitable for purchasing all of these items at once - a fair might have a balloon stand, but not snacks and a cake; a child's hand cannot provide these items; the sky obviously cannot provide any of these items; and a birthday party might have these items, but it is not a location the speaker can go to. Answer is
grocery store
Question: What is a negative external consequence for someone who takes part in a killing? Options: A: dies,B: being imprisoned,C: blood,D: bloody mess,E: feeling of guilt,. Knowledge: The question suggests that taking part in a killing has a negative consequence that occurs externally, meaning it is something that happens outside of the person's own emotions or physical body. While death might seem like an obvious answer, it is not an external consequence since it happens to the person themselves. Likewise, feeling guilty is an internal consequence. Blood and bloody mess are not consequences of taking part in a killing, but rather part of the act itself. Therefore, being imprisoned is the most likely answer, as it is a common legal consequence for those who take part in killings. Answer is
being imprisoned
Question: What are canadian players known for? Options: A: sporting event,B: puck hitting,C: hockey game,D: soccer game,E: stadium,. Knowledge: The context suggests that the question is about a sport that Canadian players are known for. Hockey is a popular and widely played sport in Canada, and Canadian players are often considered some of the best in the world. Puck hitting is another term for playing hockey, further supporting the idea that the correct answer is hockey game. The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the question. Answer is
hockey game
Question: The snake was cold, what did it seek? Options: A: warm place,B: wooded area,C: blanket,D: sleeping bag,E: tropical forest,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the snake was looking for a warm place to cozy up in order to get rid of the coldness. The options "wooded area" and "tropical forest" do not have any relation to the context of the sentence, while "blanket" and "sleeping bag" are objects that the snake cannot use. Hence, the most reasonable option is "warm place." Answer is
warm place
Question: They play violin, but can't learn others' musical pieces, what couldn't they do? Options: A: calluses,B: take notes,C: read music,D: making music,E: make noise,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the people in question have a skill for playing the violin but cannot learn others' musical pieces. This suggests that they may have difficulty reading sheet music, which is a common way to learn how to play specific songs. The other options do not have a clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is
read music
Question: A person was finishing a test and looking frantically at the clock, what did they have to do? Options: A: sun himself,B: express love,C: cross street,D: relax,E: race against time,. Knowledge: The person is looking frantically at the clock, which suggests that they are running out of time to complete a task, in this case, finishing a test. The phrase "race against time" means to try to complete a task before a deadline or before time runs out, which fits the context of the sentence. The other choices do not have any connection to the concept of running out of time or feeling the pressure to finish a task quickly. Answer is
race against time
Question: If you get in a fight after getting drunk where are you likely to end up? Options: A: bar,B: jail,C: raise hell,D: liquor store,E: gutter,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that getting in a fight after getting drunk can result in legal consequences, such as being arrested and ending up in jail. The other options are unlikely outcomes as they do not involve legal consequences. Answer is
jail
Question: Upon discovering the truth unexpectedly, what did it do to the scientist? Options: A: denial,B: wars,C: relief,D: understanding,E: startled,. Knowledge: The word "unexpectedly" suggests that the scientist was caught off guard by the truth. The word "startled" means to be surprised or shocked suddenly, which fits the context of the sentence. "Denial" and "relief" are emotions that may occur after processing the truth, but they do not fit the immediate reaction of the scientist. "Wars" does not make sense in this context as it is not an emotion or a reaction to discovering the truth. "Understanding" may be a possible outcome of discovering the truth, but it does not fit the context of the sentence which suggests a sudden reaction. Answer is
startled
Question: If people have no contact with others they will experience what emotion? Options: A: feel lonely,B: togetherness,C: feed themselves,D: compete with each other,E: talk to each other,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the lack of contact with others leads to a particular emotion. Lonely is a common feeling when people are isolated from others. The options "togetherness," "feed themselves," "compete with each other," and "talk to each other" do not address the question of what emotion people might experience when they have no contact with others. Answer is
feel lonely
Question: She wanted to learn to needlepoint, what was he goal competency? Options: A: collection of folk art,B: sewing,C: livingroom,D: paint,E: frame,.

sewing
Question: If you're a construction foreman and your job is to supervise others, what would your eyes been doing all day? Options: A: fill with tears,B: see work,C: burning,D: glass over,E: dry out,. Knowledge: The job of a construction foreman is to supervise others, which implies that they need to be constantly monitoring the work being done by others. Therefore, it's likely that their eyes would be focused on "seeing work" all day, rather than doing any of the other activities described in the answer choices. The other options don't make sense in the context of the sentence and are unlikely to be associated with the work of a construction foreman. Answer is
see work
Question: How might a person go somewhere? Options: A: stumbling down,B: die,C: might fly,D: might drive car,E: get somewhere,. Knowledge: The question is asking for a method of transportation, and the option "might drive car" is a realistic and common way for a person to get from one place to another. "Stumbling down" and "dying" are not appropriate answers because they do not relate to transportation. "Flying" may be a possible answer, but it is less common and practical compared to driving a car. "Get somewhere" is too general and does not provide any information on how the person would get there. Answer is
might drive car
Question: A super ball is a popular what that children enjoy? Options: A: toy,B: park,C: earball,D: play with,E: bounces,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that a super ball is something that children enjoy, and it can also bounce. This description aligns with a toy that is specifically designed for play and entertainment, which is why "toy" is the correct answer. The other options do not accurately describe what a super ball is or how it is used. In addition, "earball" is not a commonly used word, which further indicates that it is not the correct answer. Answer is
toy
Question: The teacher was trying to describe what an island was to the young children, she explained it was a piece of land surrounded by what? Options: A: hawaii,B: body of water,C: niagra falls,D: mississippi river,E: pacific ocean,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that an island is surrounded by something, and the most logical option is a body of water. Hawaii is a specific location, and not all islands are located in Hawaii, so it cannot be the correct answer. Niagara Falls and Mississippi River are not related to islands or bodies of water, making them irrelevant choices. The Pacific Ocean is a larger body of water, but not all islands are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, so it is not the best answer. Answer is
body of water
Question: The toddler thought it would be fun to try eating breakfast in bed, what resulted? Options: A: contentment,B: indigestion,C: vomiting,D: mess,E: catastrophe,. Knowledge: The sentence implies that the toddler's attempt at eating breakfast in bed did not go as planned, resulting in some kind of negative outcome. The word "mess" is the most likely choice, as it suggests that the toddler made a mess by spilling food and/or drinks on the bed. The other options (excluding indigestion, which is another possibility) suggest more severe consequences, such as vomiting or catastrophe, which are not supported by the context of the sentence. Answer is
mess
Question: When you got on the sleighing ride you were only headed one way, and that way was what? Options: A: going down hill,B: confusion,C: death,D: straight away,E: kissing,. Knowledge: The phrase "sleighing ride" suggests an activity in which one rides in a sled or sleigh, typically down a snow-covered slope. The phrase "only headed one way" suggests that there is no turning or changing direction involved. The phrase "going down hill" is the only answer choice that accurately reflects the activity described and is commonly associated with sleighing. The other answer choices are not related to sleighing or do not make sense in this context. Answer is
going down hill
Question: Where would you go to buy a ball or bat? Options: A: sporting event,B: street,C: sporting goods store,D: hole,E: mall,. Knowledge: A ball or bat is most commonly associated with sports, and the sentence implies that the speaker is looking to purchase these items. While one could potentially find sports equipment at a sporting event or on the street, these options are less reliable and specific than going to a dedicated sporting goods store. A hole and mall are even less likely locations to find sports equipment. Answer is
sporting goods store
Question: The couple was looking to adopt, what were they looking at profiles of? Options: A: abandon,B: give away,C: biological child,D: homeless,E: orphan,.

"Abandon" and "give away" suggest a situation where a child is given up by their birth parents, while "biological child" implies that the couple is looking to have their own child. "Homeless" is not relevant in this context. Answer is
orphan

In social situations, people often want to present themselves in an attractive and positive light, which can involve grooming and dressing up. The other options, such as being late or needing to get somewhere, do not fit the context of the sentence.  Additionally, "unclean" implies that the people were already dirty, which is not mentioned in the sentence. Answer is
looking pretty

Burning paper is a common method for starting a fire, especially in indoor settings. It produces a flame quickly and can help ignite other flammable materials, such as kindling or branches. The other choices may also be used to start a fire, but they do not specifically match the context of the sentence, which mentions crumpling up some material before starting the fire. Answer is
burn paper

smile

Knowledge: The sentence implies that the toothbrush was given as a gift, rather than purchased. It also mentions that the man received the toothbrush (rather than buying it) which suggests that he obtained it from a place where toothbrushes are commonly given out for free.

Knowledge: The context of the sentence implies that the person is locking something for safety or security reasons at night. The options "own," "gate," and "entrance" are too broad and could refer to a variety of things.

This is reinforced by the fact that the other options do not fit the context of the sentence.

"Gain" does not make sense in this context. Answer is

In a household setting, it is common to put clean dishes in the kitchen cupboard to store them until they are needed again.

Question: Where is a good place to plant an apple tree you just bought? Options: A: pennsylvania,B: across the street,C: front yard,D: countryside,E: park,. Knowledge: Apple trees require a lot of sunlight to grow and bear fruit, so planting them in a location that gets at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day is important. The front yard is often a good choice because it is usually the most accessible and visible location, and it also tends to receive more sunlight than other parts of the property. Planting the apple tree across the street or in a park is not a practical or viable option. Pennsylvania and countryside are not specific enough locations to determine whether they would be good places to plant an apple tree. Answer is
front yard
Question: Where must a jellyfish live? Options: A: store,B: see,C: japanese restaurant,D: hawaii,E: salt water,. Knowledge: Jellyfish are aquatic creatures and require water to survive. However, not all water is suitable for them. Jellyfish are typically found in oceans and other bodies of salt water, where they can thrive.

The choice "see" is also unlikely since jellyfish generally cannot survive outside of water. Answer is

Telling a story is a more specific action that can be included within the broader category of communication.

Knowledge: The question is asking specifically about how an investor gets cash, which suggests that the answer must relate to the buying and selling of assets. "Save money" and "from a job" are not relevant because they do not involve any kind of investment activity. "Buy stock" is not the correct answer because it involves putting money into an investment, not getting money out of it.

The word "green" suggests that the insects are consuming some sort of plant matter, which would be most likely found in a field or other green areas. The other options, such as air, rock, or Arctic, do not provide any obvious sources of green matter for insects to eat.

The phrase "you only get" suggests that this is something that cannot be replaced or obtained again. Muscles, mouth, and two arms are specific parts of the body, but the sentence refers to the body as a whole. Stupidity is not related to the context of the sentence.

A restaurant or rest area may have many seats, but they would likely not all be couches, and not everyone would be sitting on them.

Knowledge: Beavers are known for building dams out of sticks and branches. Therefore, they would need to have access to a source of these materials in order to build their dams. A wooded area would be the most likely place for a beaver to find the necessary materials. The other options, such as a zoo, body of water, or Home Depot, do not provide the natural materials that a beaver would need to construct a dam. Books are obviously not a source of physical materials. Answer is
wooded area
Question: A person who works 14 hours a day will have very little what? Options: A: sleep,B: care about,C: spare time,D: know everything,E: own house,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that someone who works 14 hours a day will have very little of something, which indicates that it is a resource that is limited or scarce. The options "sleep" and "care about" could be logically connected to working long hours, but the sentence specifically mentions "very little," which rules out those options since they are absolute quantities. "Know everything" is not directly related to the context of the sentence and is not a logical consequence of working long hours. "Own house" is also not a logical consequence of working long hours and is not directly related to the context of the sentence. Therefore, "spare time" is the correct answer since it is a resource that is likely to be scarce for someone who works long hours. Answer is
spare time

Learning an instrument is often associated with learning music theory and developing an understanding of musical structure, which may explain why the teacher suggested playing piano as a starting point. The other options do not have a clear connection to the sentence, as they either describe a process of learning or practicing an instrument, rather than a broader introduction to music. Answer is

The other options do not address the specific needs mentioned in the sentence. Taking a nap may provide temporary relief from boredom, but it won't address hunger. Doing a crossword puzzle or seeing art may help with boredom but won't address hunger. Playing games may provide entertainment but again won't address the issue of hunger. Answer is
grocery shop

rest in bed

However, in context, the sentence suggests that the speaker made a mistake while playing a different game where "king me" is not a common phrase. The other options (scrabble, deck of cards, castle) do not involve moves or phrases that are similar to "king me," leaving chess game as the most likely option. In chess, the phrase "check" and "checkmate" are commonly used, and the term "king" is relevant because it is one of the pieces on the board. Answer is
chess game

The option "picking up after dog" is not a feeling but an action that may be associated with walking a dog.

Question: After making successfully climbing a difficult ascent you gain a sense of what? Options: A: vertigo,B: exhaustion,C: getting higher,D: accomplishment,E: fear of heights,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that after successfully climbing a difficult ascent, you experience a feeling or a sense. Getting higher and vertigo may be temporary sensations that occur during the climb, but they do not relate to the sense you feel afterward. Exhaustion may be a result of climbing, but it does not express the feeling you gain after completing the climb. Fear of heights is the opposite of what you would feel after successfully completing a climb. Accomplishment makes sense as it implies a positive feeling of achievement after overcoming a challenge. Answer is

Options: A: new perspective,B: increasing knowledge,C: understanding,D: more intelligence,E: inspiration,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person did not initially comprehend the subject, but gained something after studying it for a while. "Understanding" is the most appropriate answer as it directly relates to the sentence structure and the meaning of the word. "New perspective" could also be a possible answer, but it is not as specific and does not directly state that the person gained comprehension. "Increasing knowledge," "more intelligence," and "inspiration" do not fit as well since they do not specifically describe the person's change in comprehension. Answer is
understanding

In many cultures, shaking hands is a customary way of ending a meeting or agreeing on something, so it is the most likely choice.

Kissing or smiling may be inappropriate in professional or formal settings. Answer is
shake hands

Out of the options provided, only "movement" could indicate that the child was still on the move. "Arriving" suggests that the child had already reached the destination, "driving" is a method of transportation rather than an indication of progress, "excitement" could be a result of arriving at the destination or undergoing a change in plans, and "expense" has no relevance to the context. Therefore, "movement" is the correct answer. Answer is
movement

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the subject being described is likely a place or location where individuals consume excessive amounts of alcohol and may exhibit behaviors associated with high levels of testosterone, such as aggression or risk-taking. Fraternity houses are often associated with this type of environment, as they are typically places where young men socialize, drink, and engage in activities related to college life. The other options, such as beer or wine, are simply types of alcohol and do not provide any contextual clues to support them as the correct answer. The restaurant and pub options do not provide any contextual clues related to excessive alcohol or testosterone. Answer is

"Feel remorse" is the most appropriate answer as it aligns with the commonly accepted view that killing another living being (whether human or animal) can elicit feelings of guilt, regret, and sorrow. "Hunger" and "commit crime" are unlikely answers as they do not pertain to the emotional or psychological effects of taking a life. "Take life" and "dies" are technically correct but are too general and do not capture the specific emotional state that the sentence is asking about. Answer is
feel remorse
Question: The aboriginal people ended up being displaced by settlers who justified themselves with the fact that the displaced people didn't have a formal system to do what? Options: A: fight back,B: spend time,C: own home,D: talk to each other,E: own land,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the aboriginal people were displaced by settlers who used their lack of a formal system as justification.

The other options do not have a clear link to the context of the sentence. Answer is

battlefield
Question: If you're feeling a little bit of fatigue what can you do? Options: A: sit on chair,B: stand up,C: sit down,D: sleep,E: have rest,. Knowledge: The keyword "fatigue" suggests that the person is tired and needs to rest. Among the choices, "have rest" is the most appropriate because it directly addresses the person's need to relax and recharge. "Sleep" is also a good option, but it is more time-consuming than simply having a rest. "Sit on chair" and "stand up" do not necessarily provide relief from fatigue, while "sit down" is redundant as it doesn't provide any new information. Answer is
have rest

The other options do not properly convey the meaning of waiting or suggest impatience. "Stay in one place" is a similar phrase but does not necessarily imply waiting or delay. "To waist time" is a misspelling of "waste time" and suggests a negative connotation of waiting, rather than a patient one. "1000nd" is not a word and has no association with waiting or patience.

have patience

A meadow is a natural open space filled with wildflowers and grass, which would be an ideal location for the bug to find what it was looking for without the possibility of human interruption.

Question: The cat seemed calm around the stranger, but it was actually quite what and ready to claw? Options: A: medium,B: excited,C: agitated,D: frantic,E: frenzied,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the cat may have been giving a false impression of its behavior around the stranger, as it was actually ready to claw. The word "calm" is used as a contrast to the actual behavior of the cat, which suggests that it may have been masking its true feelings. The words "excited," "medium," and "frantic" do not capture the negative connotations associated with the word "claw," whereas "agitated" and "frenzied" do.

agitated

"Short rope" is a technical limitation rather than a psychological one. Answer is
fear of heights

A choker is a type of necklace that fits closely around the neck, and it is often worn as a fashion accessory.

The other options do not have any clear connection to the context of the sentence. Answer is

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that playing tennis involves a lot of lateral movement, which would require the use of leg muscles. Additionally, the phrase "great workout" implies that physical exercise is involved, which would further support the idea that the answer is "legs." The other options do not seem to be directly related to the context of the sentence - "skill" and "competition" may be important aspects of playing tennis, but they do not necessarily relate to the physical demands of the sport. Answer is
legs
Question: The snake was very cold inside it's cage, so at the first opportunity it did what? Options: A: pet,B: rude,C: tropical forest,D: sun itself,E: tree,. Knowledge: Since the sentence describes a cold snake in a cage, it can be inferred that the snake is trying to warm itself up. The choice "sun itself" makes the most sense, as snakes are known to bask in the sun to regulate their body temperature. The other options, such as "pet" or "rude", do not provide any logical connection to the situation described. "Tropical forest" or "tree" could be possible answers if the context suggested that the snake was trying to escape or find shelter in a natural habitat, which is not the case in this sentence.

Answer is
entertaining

Options: A: drug store,B: high end store,C: beauty salon,D: box,E: bathroom,. Knowledge: The sentence indicates that the store specializes in prescriptions, which implies that it is a drug store. The sentence also suggests that the store charges higher prices for most other goods, which might deter customers from buying non-essential items there. Therefore, buying a hair dryer at this store would likely be convenient but more expensive. The other options do not fit the context of the sentence. Answer is
drug store

Knowledge: The question suggests that the use of a laser is intended to alleviate suffering, which is a common medical application of lasers. The options "nasa" and "CD players" are unrelated to medical practices, and "laboratory" could refer to any number of scientific fields. "Ophthalmologist's office" is a medical setting, but the question does not provide enough information to suggest that a laser would be used to alleviate suffering in that particular context. "Hospital" is the most logical choice, as it is a medical facility where patients receive treatment for a range of illnesses and injuries. Answer is
hospital

Question: Driving to work can be monotonous, she would play her favorite music and just what along with it? Options: A: sing,B: listen to radio,C: listen to music,D: speed,E: head bang,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the person would play their favorite music during their monotonous commute to work. It then goes on to suggest that they would "just ____ along with it." Speeding or headbanging do not fit the context of this sentence and are not a common activity during a daily commute. Listening to the radio or music are also possibilities, but the sentence includes the word "just" which implies that the person was doing something in addition to listening to music. The most plausible answer is singing along with the music they were playing. Answer is
sing

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the difficulty in predicting a rebound in basketball is due to some characteristic of the ball or rim. The options "dribbling," "bouncing around court," and "full of air" do not refer to a characteristic of the ball or rim that would make it difficult to predict a rebound. The option "punctured" would make the ball behave in an unpredictable way, but this is not the reason why rebounds are difficult to predict. The option "round" makes sense because a round ball and rim can produce unpredictable bounces and rebounds. Answer is
round

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that there is a musical program happening tonight, and one of the groups listed will serve as the cover for that program. "Opera" and "symphonic" refer to specific types of music rather than groups that would perform at a program. "Television" and "computer" have no clear connection to the context of the sentence. "Concert" is the most likely choice, as it refers to a performance by a group of musicians and is often used as a synonym for "musical program." Answer is
concert
Question: Where can you get a dining room table? Options: A: house,B: rug,C: shoe store,D: home,E: furniture store,.

Options: A: demolish object,B: repair,C: fix,D: create,E: construct,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the object in question was damaged but not completely destroyed. In such a case, repairing the damage would be a logical next step. Demolishing the object, creating a new one, or constructing something new would not be appropriate actions to take if the object is still salvageable. "Fix" and "repair" are essentially synonymous in this context, but "repair" may sound more appropriate in this instance because it suggests fixing something that was broken or damaged. Answer is
repair

A waste bin or trash can is the most appropriate place to discard junk mail. Answer is

Options: A: dump,B: office,C: motel,D: park,E: corner,. Knowledge: The sentence mentions housekeeping, suggesting that Billy is staying in a place where there is a cleaning staff. The description of the place as "cheap" further supports the idea that he is staying in a budget motel, as this type of lodging often does not have daily housekeeping services. The other options, dump, office, park, and corner, do not fit the context provided in the sentence. Answer is
motel
Question: He bought an apple tree to plant near Providence, where did the tree get planted? Options: A: beach,B: rhode island,C: idaho,D: new hampshire,E: fields,.

The most likely option is flea market, as these types of markets are known for selling a variety of vintage and antique items. Answer is
flea market

Question: what is another word for getting drunk? Options: A: intoxication,B: blazed,C: vomiting,D: hangover,E: being sick,.

Intoxication is a common term used to describe the state of being drunk or under the influence of alcohol.

city council meeting

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the tool had a standard sizing, implying that the bolt did not match this standard size. The word "fit" reinforces this idea, as it implies that the two objects did not match up properly. Knowing the definitions of the other options can also help eliminate them as possible answers - "informal" and "colloquial" relate to language use, not tools and bolts, while "standard wing" and "stanine" are not commonly used terms in this context.

nonstandard
Question: The king strolled through his back courtyard, where was near? Options: A: palace,B: garden,C: country estate,D: large house,E: suburbs,.

Answer is

The option "excitement" is a likely correct answer because it reflects an outcome that many people experience when learning about science.

Answer is

The phrase "have fun" is a broad, general statement that encompasses various activities one might engage in while at a party, such as dancing, socializing, or playing games.

It is unlikely that he would eat at a space shuttle or Disneyland as these are not common places for people to grab a quick meal. Supermarkets and gas stations may have food options, but they are not typically places where people would eat before going on a long vacation.

Keeping a tourniquet in a hospital or ambulance would not be practical for most people, and applying even pressure would not be effective in all situations.

emergency kit

Knowledge: The context of the sentence suggests that the consequences of "hurting someone else" are being discussed. In this case, legal problems would be the most likely consequence, as it is against the law to harm another person. The other options do not make logical sense in this context - "more hurt" and "physical pain" suggest that the person who caused the harm would be the one experiencing pain, which is not specified in the sentence. "Public outcry" may be a consequence of a high-profile incident, but it does not necessarily imply any legal action. "Money" may come into play if there is a lawsuit, but it is not a direct consequence of hurting someone else. Answer is
legal problems

Question: They all wanted to play a board game, it was retrieved from inside where? Options: A: cupboard,B: under the bed,C: shelf,D: toy store,E: house,. Knowledge: The sentence suggests that the board game was stored somewhere inside the house, and the most logical place to store a board game would be in a cupboard or shelf. Under the bed is not a common storage place for board games, and a toy store would not be a logical answer as this would suggest that the group had to go out and purchase the board game before playing it. House is too broad a term and doesn't provide any specific location within the house. Answer is
cupboard

Knowledge: The sentence suggests that opening a business requires a specific quality that the individual must possess.

"Money" and "funding" can be important for starting a business, but the sentence specifically mentions something the individual needs inside them. "Creativity" may be helpful, but it is not essential for starting a business. However, "determination" is often cited as a crucial quality for entrepreneurs because starting a business is frequently difficult and requires the ability to persevere through setbacks and obstacles.

Fairytales often involve magical creatures, enchanted objects or mysterious settings that are beyond the realm of the ordinary world. The other choices do not fit with the context of the sentence - a farm yard or farm country would not likely contain fantastical elements, Michigan is a state and therefore cannot be like "something out of", and a horror movie would suggest a scary or gruesome discovery, which is not implied by the sentence. Answer is
fairytale
